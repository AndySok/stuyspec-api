1	Jeremy Rynders Replaces Randi Damesek as AP of Organization	jeremy-rynders-replaces-randi-damesek-as-ap-of-organization	<p>To find a replacement for Damesek, Contreras reached out to a few colleagues. “[Rynders] was highly recommended by trusted colleagues, including [Damesek],” Contreras said.</p><p>Contreras values Rynders’ experience and understanding of Stuyvesant culture and believes these qualities made him stand out from the other candidates. “He has six years of experience doing operations, so he knows all the systems, from [human resources] to budget,” Contreras said. “I felt that he scripted in his [application] letter some of the larger understanding of the student body [such as] the reference of the desire to go to the moon, and we have many students here [with] equivalent ambitions [...] to do something bigger than themselves. And he understood that unique part of Stuyvesant.”</p><p>Rynders feels honored to be selected as the new AP of Organization and is eager for the school year to start. “Stuyvesant is a place where the sky's the limit when it comes to what students will achieve, and I'm excited to be a part of that,” he said.</p><p>At the same time, Rynders is also aware of the challenges he will have to face. “Stuyvesant is a large and dynamic school that demands someone be able to consider the needs of a great number of competing priorities,” Rynders said. “I hope to be a school leader that people will see as responsive, resourceful, and fair.”</p><p>During this upcoming school year, Rynders hopes to build a relationship with the students, staff, and parents. “I believe those relationships are essential to the effective execution of my duties, but I acknowledge that [it] is no small task with a student body of 3,500 young people,” he said.</p><p>Rynders has yet to go through the Chancellor’s Regulation C-30—a process that regulates the selection of APs—to be appointed as a permanent AP of Organization. “I had the option to bring in Rynders immediately [with] a C-30, but I choose to not [to] in the absence of all [the administrators]. I like to hear everyone else’s voice and opinion,” Contreras said.</p><p>Later this year, Contreras will issue a post for the permanent AP of Organization position. Candidates like Rynders will be able to apply and will have to go through the C-30 process, which includes an interview with the School Leadership Team—a council of student, parent, and faculty representatives.</p><p>Contreras does not expect the change in administration to affect the student body.  “[People] come and go, but one constant is the brilliance of our students, and that’s what makes Stuy a very special place. The work of adults will always be significant, but our defining piece is how we support the brilliant hardworking ambition of our student body. And that is what is most important, regardless of who’s name is to that title,” Contreras said.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:36:37.129588	1	1	Randi Damesek resigned from her position of Assistant Principal of Organization and has been replaced by Jeremy Rynders.
2	﻿Tahseen Chowdhury on Campaigning for State Senate	tahseen-chowdhury-on-campaigning-for-state-senate	<p>Student Union (SU) President Tahseen Chowdhury has always been a force to be reckoned with—confidently swaggering down the hallway as if he owns the place. And, to the Stuyvesant student body, he very well may.</p><p>Though Chowdhury is part of a “dynasty” of students who worked their way up the political ladder, going from Freshman Caucus president to SU president, he has always fought against becoming another cog in the wheel of SU inefficiency.</p><p>“Two or three years ago, we were going down a route where the SU would be bankrupt by the middle of my senior year if I hadn’t stepped in and stabilized the budget,” he said.  Since Chowdhury first became involved with school politics in the seventh grade, he has always sought to take concrete action.</p><p>This year, Chowdhury decided to take his political activism to the next level. He will be running for the position of State Senate for District 13, which is comprised of Jackson Heights, Corona, and East Elmhurst, in the 2018 election. As a state senator, Chowdhury would be responsible for writing, proposing, and voting on new legislation.</p><p>With these opportunities, Chowdhury believes that he will be able to positively impact not only his district, but also the entire state of New York. “I love sitting in a law library and finding ways to implement new ideas within the structures that exist. I believe I'll be able to take ideas and turn them into bills that'll benefit the community as a whole,” he said in an e-mail interview. “I also genuinely believe I'm a good candidate because of my lack of experience. I'm a fresh face in New York politics.”</p><p>He will be running against incumbent Senator Jose Peralta, who Chowdhury believes didn’t actually follow through with the promises made in his platform. In particular, Chowdhury is dissatisfied with the senator’s choice to align himself with the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), a group of eight senators. He labels the IDC as a wolf in sheep’s clothing— ready to use the “Democrat” label to gain votes all the while obstructing the passage of progressive policies in the state senate.</p><p>Chowdhury’s disdain toward the IDC began to develop as he worked alongside Senator and member of the IDC Jesse Hamilton in 2016. “[Hamilton and I] wanted to propose and pass a piece of legislation that would reconstruct the panel [that decides on] educational policy. I felt that students should have the ability to advocate for what they want to see in the Department of Education,” Chowdhury said. Despite his attempt at empowering New York’s student body, he was shut out and ignored. Hamilton’s contact with him ceased altogether afterward.</p><p>Once Donald Trump was elected and Peralta had been accepted into the IDC, Chowdhury immediately began to think about what could be done.“It was really unsettling to me because the IDC was literally empowering Republicans in a way that the Republicans really shouldn’t be empowered,” he said.</p><p>Therefore, Chowdhury’s platform features a progressive outlook on issues ranging from affordable housing and safe streets to a legal defense fund for undocumented immigrants and “desegregation” in public schools. It highlights a comprehensive educational policy with an emphasis on student representation. One of Chowdhury’s proposed legislations even gives students the right to vote on the panel for educational reform.</p><p>He also proposes numerous changes that he believes would benefit the environment, such as a plastic bag tax and the creation of a task force dedicated to installing bike racks. Additionally, he hopes to bolster affordable health care and protect senior citizens by regulating nurse-to-patient ratios.</p><p>“New York is one of the most progressive states,” Chowdhury said. “If someone is going to think ‘progressive,’ they should think ‘New York.’ If someone is going to think ‘democratic’ they should think ‘New York.’”</p><p>Not only does Chowdhury believe he knows more about his community than Peralta does, but he also believes that he’s just as qualified of a candidate in other aspects. “[My experiences at Stuyvesant will] play a major role in actual politics because I understand how people operate,” he said. “I can sit down and think about the administration's perspective. I can also think about the students’ perspective and find a point where both perspectives meet. I’m sure I’ll be able to do this at the state level as well.”</p><p>Presently, Chowdhury’s campaigning has not officially started. However, he has been focusing on preparation for when his campaigning officially begins in March 2018. Being present on social media, engaging with his community about various issues, and fundraising is Chowdhury’s current priority. He has made attending anti-IDC and progressive rallies with fellow student volunteers a common ritual. “We go to rallies to talk to people and figure out what people think about and care about. I’m always excited about people caring about these issues,” he said.</p><p>In fact, this grassroots type campaigning was inspired by that of former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.“One of the things Bernie Sanders told us was that we have to make sure that young people are running for office in their home states and home districts because we have to make sure that we are rising and resisting anywhere and everywhere we can,” he said.</p><p>Despite often being criticized for running before he’s even had the ability to vote, Chowdhury firmly maintains that no one is ever too young to get involved. “I've always been someone who likes to do things people might argue I'm a little too young for, whether that be starting a nonprofit, running a business, or running for office,” he said in an e-mail interview. “If you want to get active, just do it. It really is scary to put yourself out there, but it’s also most important that you advocate for your community.”</p><p>While most seniors are bombarded by the stress of the college application process and look forward to second semester as a time to blow off some steam, Chowdhury’s 2017-2018 school year will look quite different. “The election is after my senior year, but the campaign will take up the bulk of my second term. I'm excited for second term because this is a challenge that I think I can tackle. I'm limited to applying to colleges in NYC but that's something I'm completely fine with. New York is a great place and I'm ready to make sure that we make it better,” he said.</p><p>Chowdhury would like to thank the Stuyvesant community for rooting for him when he announced his candidacy. “I like to take everything I learn and apply it to the SU, so if anything, this campaign will allow me to improve my work within the SU. I don't think there's any way for it to negatively affect me,” he said.”Without a doubt, I would not be able to hold this together without the support I have from the community.”</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:37:34.639927	1	1	To explain Tahseen Chowdhury’s decision to run for the position of State State and talk about his political history.
255	﻿Deadly Terror Attack Outside Stuyvesant	deadly-terror-attack-outside-stuyvesant	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Walking across the Tribeca bridge, senior Grace Tang was headed to a doctor’s appointment when she heard a loud crash. Below, she saw the mangled remains of a school bus and an armed man running around. “He came out and he had two guns with him,” Tang said. “That was when I started running back into the school.”</p><p>Sayfullo Saipov drove a Home Depot rental truck down the Hudson River bike path on Tuesday, October 31, before crashing into a school bus in front of Stuyvesant. Eight people were killed and 12 were injured in what became the deadliest act of terrorism in New York City since 9/11. One of those injured was Stuyvesant’s biology lab specialist Dr. Yanjun Zhang.</p><p>The next day, students returned to school, taking a detour around the cordoned-off section of the West Side Highway, the chaotic roar of helicopters and sirens replaced by a solemn stream of high schoolers, dressed in black out of respect for the victims. Tuesday’s attack will have both global and political repercussions, but it has also profoundly impacted the Stuyvesant community.</p><p><b>The Attack </b></p><p>Saipov turned the truck onto the bike path along the West Side Highway near Houston Street at 3:04 PM on October 31 and mowed down bicyclists and pedestrians.</p><p>“We walked up to the bike path and we saw pools of blood, bloodied up jackets, broken bikes with blood on them, people crying, it was something out of a movie almost,” said sophomore Andrew Hirtle, who was at Pier 40 for football practice.</p><p>Four minutes later, Saipov crashed into a school bus parked at Chambers Street. Saipov jumped out of the van, brandishing a paintball gun and a pellet gun. “I was at the mural, near the entrance of the bridge [...] I heard the crash, then we went to look and saw a lot of smoke. Then we saw a man jump out of the van,” freshman Laith Bahlouli said.</p><p>Saipov allegedly began shouting “Allahu Akbar,” Arabic for “God is great.” “He shouted that phrase [...] he screamed ‘Allahu Akbar,’” said freshman Timothy Yen, who was also near the Chambers Street mural during the incident.</p><p>Students and staff ran into the school to alert security about the attack. “I was sitting at the main desk when a substitute teacher, Lisa Erica James, came in and ran to me sitting at the main desk and told me there’s a man outside with a gun. My coworker [Agent] McConnell locked the doors and I started pushing the kids inside the auditorium,” School Safety Agent B. Taylor said.</p><p>As Stuyvesant locked its doors, police officers, who were in the building due to an emotionally distressed student, responded to the attack. “The first thing I saw was the smashed bus,” junior Tobias Zinner said. “I walked further into the street to see what was going on, and then I noticed all the cops next to me were crouched down and had their guns out of their holsters, and they were screaming, ‘He has a gun, he has a gun,’ and then I heard shots fired.”</p><p>Police officer Ryan Nash of the First Precinct fired nine shots, one of which hit Saipov in the abdomen. This effectively ended the attack, and Saipov was rushed to Bellevue Hospital Center.</p><p>Inside, approximately halfway through tenth period and only minutes after Saipov was shot, the administration tried to assess the extent of the attack and immediately began following the NYCDOE’s General Response Protocol (GRP), instituting a shelter-in.</p><p>“I was going from the third floor to the second floor and [saw] from the stairwell by the window that kids were rushing back into school,” Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey Pedrick said. “At that time of day students should be leaving not rushing back in, so I opened the door and said, ‘What happened, what happened?’ and a kid said there was a shooter. So I turned to [Assistant Principal of Organization Jeremy] Rynders and said we have to shelter in. [We] went into his office because he has a [loudspeaker] and I called the shelter-in. And then for the next however many hours, I continued to work the loudspeaker.”</p><p>Faculty and students were instructed to remain inside the building and respond to announcements while conducting business as usual. All staff and students receive training in the GRP through drills that are conducted throughout the school year. “You have to be certified in school-building leadership to become an assistant principal,” Pedrick said. “So there’s that training, but then, schools are required to run drills and have meetings of the BRT, which is the building response team. I also run the crisis team. All the drills that [Assistant Principal of Security, Health, and Physical Education Brian Moran] runs really helps keep what to do fresh in your mind.”</p><p>However, under these circumstances, it became clear that this training did little to alleviate the anxiety of the community: an emotional response to terrorism can’t be taught. “As Pedrick was talking, we heard shots fired. [Computer Science teacher JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver] peeked out the window, and he said that there was a smashed school bus,” senior Adam Abbas said. “We assumed that the noise was the engine popping. Then, we start checking the news. When we found out that it was a shooting, it still hadn’t clicked in my mind.”</p><p>As the shelter-in commenced, Parent Coordinator Dina Ingram sent out an e-mail to inform parents of the active situation that was occurring right outside Stuyvesant and the procedures that were being followed.</p><p>Students in the building began using social media to figure out what had happened, receiving messages through Facebook from friends who were outside, or even watching Snapchat videos from students who recorded the event. Others looked to Twitter and news websites for live updates.</p><p>Despite rumors that Stuyvesant students were hurt and that the school bus had children from P226M, the special education school located within Stuyvesant’s building, the bus was not connected to Stuyvesant, according to Principal Eric Contreras. The injured students are 14 and 17 years old, and P226M serves 18-21 year olds.</p><p>While Pedrick kept announcing that the shelter-in would continue, police officers and FBI agents began circulating the building. “Stuyvesant is a location which offers a conference space with a smartboard, online access, and conference calling. The police requested the use of the facilities to set up an operations hub. The same thing happened during 9/11,” Contreras said.</p><p>With Mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and counterterrorism officials sealing off the conference room to coordinate the investigation, the administration had to work with NYPD to start planning how they would dismiss students in an orderly manner so that they would not compromise the ongoing investigations. “I started working with Moran on a plan to dismiss students while we waited. We knew that Chambers was closed and that multiple blocks of the West Side Highway were closed. We also knew that we didn’t have access to the bridge,” Contreras said. “I asked the staff to set up the CASS [scanner] system so we could make sure that everyone was here.”</p><p>Once the coordinated evacuation began, NYPD sergeants visited each classroom to inform students and staff about the situation and elicit any pertinent information students may have had regarding the attack.</p><p>Meanwhile, the school administration figured out the logistics for students, supplying MetroCards and designating an area in the theater where students could wait for their parents.</p><p>“Once they gave us the go ahead, we dismissed by floors and asked students to scan out,” Contreras said. “We asked teachers to line the road along River Terrace to guide students to the main streets. That was another big moment for me because I saw teachers whose days were supposed to [be] over hours earlier line up in the cold and stay there. It took time to dismiss, but they stayed there.”</p><p>After all the students were safely dismissed, administration stayed at the building until past 11 p.m. in order to plan for Wednesday. “Collaborating with the Chancellor’s office and the Mayor’s office, we decided that we needed to be open the next day. I also took the decision to cancel homework and exams the next day to ease some of the stress,” Contreras said. “We realized that the streets were safe and that there wasn’t an active crime scene so we thought it was best to stay open.”</p><p><b>In The Wake of Terror</b></p><p>Students and parents received an e-mail that night from Ingram on behalf of Contreras, addressing the incident and outlining protocol for the next day. A several-block radius was closed off for police and FBI investigation, and the e-mail included a special map for walking to school. Students were not allowed to go outside during free periods or lunch, and there was no access to the Tribeca bridge.</p><p>“Coming home and realizing what we had gone through and that something awful had happened was really hard,” Abbas said.</p><p>In an effort to reflect on the events, the Student Union began organizing a response. “We asked every student to wear black as a way to pay tribute to the victims of the attack and a symbol of the Stuyvesant community’s unity,” Student Union Vice President Alexa Valentino said.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Stuyvesant students walked to school along police-barricaded sidewalks. “It’s really weird seeing how the street’s empty, being rerouted. It’s just surreal, knowing what I saw on the news last night actually happened to me and I was there,” sophomore Caitlin Chao said after her Wednesday morning commute.</p><p>At the same time, federal prosecutors began filing terrorism charges against Saipov, attributing the attack to ISIS. Saipov waived his Miranda Rights at Bellevue and had begun detailing his year-long plot to drive south to the Brooklyn Bridge, hoping to ruthlessly murder people on Halloween.</p><p>The DOE and Stuyvesant administration provided several resources to help students and staff cope with Tuesday’s events, including advice from the National Association of School Psychologists’ website, printed and distributed on green papers, that advised teachers on how to discuss the event and help their students cope.</p><p>“We kept the regular counselors in the guidance suite and opened up the theater to anyone who [needed] additional support. We’re also collaborating with an outside agency to get more support for any students who just need to talk to someone about all of this,” Contreras said. A homeroom schedule was implemented in order to make an announcement about the counseling resources.</p><p>Support was also provided for adults. United Federation of Teachers Chapter Leader and statistics teacher Dr. Bernard Feigenbaum worked to get support for teachers, and counseling was available for school safety agents. “Coming back the next day was really - I was overwhelmed, but they brought in counselors, for us as well as you guys which was really good,” Agent Taylor said.</p><p>Some teachers decided it was important to address the attack in class the next day. “We spent a lot of time in most of my classes talking about it, and I am particularly conscious of how difficult it is for our Muslim students for the man who committed this act to have said ‘Allahu Akbar,’ which is a prayer that our observing Muslim students say dozens and dozens of times a day, and it only means good and loving things,” English teacher Katherine Fletcher said.</p><p>For teachers who taught at Stuyvesant during 9/11, it was difficult not to draw parallels. “The feeling was very similar, the sense of some kind of outside threat that quickly became international news,” Assistant Principal of English Eric Grossman said. “We were in the building, getting e-mails and texts from former colleagues, former students, and faculty who were watching live while we were inside. The scale, thankfully, was very different. The sense of participating in something historically can be tragic.”</p><p>In the aftermath of crisis, Stuyvesant students and faculty attempted to resume their routines. “Almost all our students came. We have great attendance for our faculty, but it was better attendance than most days,” Contreras said.</p><p>As students left the building after their extracurricular activities, Saipov was wheeled into a Manhattan federal courtroom, accused of killing eight and injuring 11. Thankfully, Dr. Zhang returned to school on Thursday. The dead include five Argentinian tourists, Hernán Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij, and Hernán Ferrucci, who came to New York to celebrate their 30-year high school reunion, Belgian tourist Anne-Laure Decadt, New Jersey resident Darren Drake, and Manhattan resident Nicholas Cleves.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-03 20:08:31.392095	27	1	
4	﻿Share Your Story: The Legacy of 9/11	share-your-story-the-legacy-of-9-11	<p>Sixteen years ago today, a tragedy struck the United States and had an especially large impact on New York City and Stuyvesant. Since our 9/11 Magazine was published, The Spectator has written countless pieces in commemoration. Today, we want to let your stories do the telling.</p><p>Responses have been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p>“Don't remember where [or] when, but I saw this thing where it said whenever [the clock] hits 9:11, the person would stay silent and contemplate for a moment. That's about as much of a connection you can get from me. I think about it, but I have no strong emotions about it like my mother and father do. Where they are from, Muslims aren't thought of very kindly, to put it nicely. Especially now, when the country is dealing with some problems involving Muslims, it just makes this gap a bit bigger. I have not been raised with suspicion against certain groups and [have not] been so close to a terrorist attack myself, but I do understand one thing: it has changed everything. So, I guess it isn't history, but I can't say I think about it often.” —Anonymous, sophomore</p><p>“My dad was a police officer and helped clean up the debris after the attacks. Every year, on 9/11, he reminds me of the many NYPD and FDNY responders who passed away, and it makes me appreciate having my father still with me today.” —William Hong, senior</p><p>“I definitely feel like there is a divide between the generation that experienced 9/11 (even if they weren't actually in New York to see it) and the generation that was born in the years afterward. Whenever [I try to] have rational arguments about the Iraq War, my elders are always able to say, ‘Well you weren't there. You didn't know what it was like.’ It's an emotionally charged event, and those who didn't live through [it] lose the ethos to be able to discuss it with those who did.” —Julian Giordano, freshman</p><p>“As a Muslim, I believe that it has shaped people's perception of me unfairly. They may not be as kind or may expect something different of me just based on my faith. They may expect me to be aggressive or menacing. They view me as a threat. And, as a Muslim woman, they may expect me to be passive. The problem is with all of this. None of these things are true.” —Fariya Farah, sophomore</p><p>“Bush's response [to 9/11] was ill-formed and misdirected and created more hate in and out of the United States. There was absolutely no reason for the United States to attack Iraq; Iraq was a fall-guy for Saudi Arabia, the country from which the terrorists actually came. George W. was settling a personal vendetta between his father and Iraq.”  —Eve Wening, sophomore</p><p>“I believe his response was justified. Too little action and the American people would complain of ‘Bush the Pacifist.’ Too much, well, you can never have too much action against a war that truly affects the American people. We achieved great influence over the Middle East, having such a large military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. Also, it set the platform for the dismantling of ISIL, which is crumbling as we speak.” —Eric Shau, sophomore</p><p>“I hear insulting remarks every day when I used to wear the hijab and the jokes revolving around me involved 9/11 and Al Qaeda. I responded with laughter, of course. Now I don't wear it for personal reasons, but some of it is because of those remarks.” —Anonymous, junior</p><p>“[If 9/11 had not happened], Trump would not have gotten elected. People have always been scared of the relative unknown, and Trump capitalized on that fear.”  —Meril Mousoom, freshman</p><p>“In many ways it united us, even though we don't feel very united at the moment. We also know what terrorists are capable of and want to do. In another way, it created a lot of tension toward the Muslim community that is shaping current political stances.” —Camille Sadoff, sophomore</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:40:05.948317	10	1	Sixteen years ago today, a tragedy struck the United States and had an especially large impact on New York City and Stuyvesant.

5	﻿David Peng: Transition From Student to Teacher	david-peng-transition-from-student-to-teacher	<p>“Oh my God, I just failed the Peng test,” someone whispers in the hall, his face gaunt with fear. Almost every Thursday, geometry teacher David Peng’s students are put on trial. At the end of the period, students funnel out of the third floor halls; commotion erupts as students scatter nervously out of the classroom with worry written all over their faces.</p><p>At Stuyvesant, Peng is notorious for his difficult geometry class. While he isn’t fully aware of the tough, hardcore reputation he has amongst his students, Peng admits that he strives to push and prepare students to the best of his ability.</p><p>As an alumnus of 2006, Peng can certainly relate to the joys, struggles, and pressures that Stuyvesant students face.</p><p>Peng admits that he was not the best student, but rather was very average with a strong interest in math. “In middle school, I performed on a high level. I was on the math team and did well in scholastic competitions. Once I got to Stuy, I felt others were ahead of me [and] much smarter and much more hardworking than me,” Peng described.</p><p>During his two years teaching at Stuyvesant, Peng has observed students facing the same difficult transition that he made. “Kids realize that this isn't a walk in the park. This is Stuy,” Peng said. “Students have this moment of realization that they need to get their act together. Some students realize that right away, for some of them it takes one exam, for some it takes the whole semester, and some still have not realized it yet!”</p><p>Peng’s parents valued education and made it their goal to make sure their son got into Stuyvesant. “It was not easy for my parents to afford test prep, especially since we came from humble beginnings,” Peng said. “Looking back, I really appreciate their sacrifices.”</p><p>Once he got into Stuyvesant, Mr. Peng noticed that his parents backed off. The mindset was that Peng’s parents knew that he was set on a good path to get a great education and make a great career for himself. “[At] Stuy, most of the pressure came from myself [because of] a drive to succeed. This carried over in college. Everything came from within.”</p><p>Peng believes students are pushed through test prep. Prep helps kids who can test well but are not necessarily the best students. Once these kids get into Stuyvesant, many tend to stop working hard; they are there because their parents pushed them to get in. Peng observes that this doesn't mix well in Stuyvesant’s competitive environment. “This serves as an important message to the student body, especially the incoming freshmen. Be at Stuyvesant because you want to be; the journey doesn’t stop once you get in. The journey is about the hard work and the opportunities you take at Stuyvesant once you get in,” he said.</p><p>He also remarked on the tunnel vision students tend to have regarding colleges and their futures. “It really doesn’t matter what school you go to, what college. I know people who graduated from Ivys and are really regretting their jobs. They aren’t happy. I also have friends who went local and are now happy and prosperous,” Peng said. “It doesn’t matter where you go. At Stuy, you have more opportunities to get to where you want to go and people should make the most out of this.”</p><p>In terms of extracurriculars, Peng was very involved in Red Cross. Initially, he pursued it because it would look good on his college application. Over time, he found that he really enjoyed it. He paddled for the Red Cross dragon boat team and noted it as a highlight of his high school career.</p><p>Peng was also on the Ultimate Frisbee team during his senior year, but couldn't play for most of the season due to an injury. “I wasn’t someone who tried to take on as many extracurriculars as possible, but wanted to do the ones I was really interested in,” Peng reflected. “This is something I really hope students understand. It's not about how many extracurriculars they do, it's about the quality of the type of work that they want to do.”</p><p>“SING! was totally around when I was at Stuy,” Peng said with a smile. He fondly described the context of 2006 SING! during his senior year. “There was this curse, that after a certain even number of years, the seniors would always lose. The last three times the seniors lost was in intervals of eight years. During my year, we had to break this curse. It was very, very close, but we won.”</p><p>Looking back, Peng really appreciated the energy that SING! brought to Stuyvesant. “It really brought school spirit to a school which could be really demoralizing,” he said. Only taking a minor role in the tech department during senior year, Peng regrets not having been more involved in SING!. “I feel like I missed out, and I really try to encourage students to get involved in SING! because it’s a really big, amazing part of the Stuy experience,” he lamented.  He is content to notice the more performance-oriented plays today, which display the various stage talents and visual arts of the students, versus the more storyline-based shows during his time.</p><p>Peng also got his first taste of teaching through extracurriculars when he assisted his friends with calculus concepts at AIS tutoring during his junior year. He pursued math and was proud to complete the rigorous honors math sequence; Peng was in the BC Calculus course while his friends were in the AB course. While his peers were having difficulty with some of the concepts, Peng understood the material and could convey it well. This gave Peng the boost to look into tutoring and teaching. That summer he took part in the Summer Youth Education Program (SYEP), during which he was paid by the city to mentor little kids in a day camp. He also did teacher’s assistant (TA) work for his old SHSAT prep center. This paved the way for his interest in teaching.</p><p>Peng attended Carnegie Mellon for his undergraduate education, where he majored in finance. When he entered in 2007, the business industry was booming. “When I was at Carnegie Mellon, there was talk of graduating with a business degree, signing with a company, making a $20,000 bonus, and making $70,000 right off the start,” Peng reflected. “It was a hype that really never materialized.”</p><p>This was largely because of a major recession from the Global Financial crisis of 2008; Peng graduated in 2010. The crash led to an absence of jobs. The one thing Peng continued to do every summer was return to New York and do TA work. When he graduated from college, he had teaching to fall back on.</p><p>Before coming back to Stuyvesant, Peng taught at the Law and City school, as well as a non-profit school in Queens. Peng says it’s a weird feeling being back at Stuyvesant, especially addressing some of his former teachers by their first names instead of ‘Mr.’ or ‘Ms.’</p><p>With his return, Mr. Peng has observed some changes around the school. For one, he has been happy to see an increase in the number of guidance counselors in the school. “Back when I was in school, we only had around three. If you had issues or was overwhelmed with stress, there really wasn't anyone to talk to. The mindset was like, ‘What do you expect? This is Stuy. Suck it up,’” he said. “Now, there are so many options for students to reach out to when they need help.”</p><p>Peng has also noticed a shift in the types of courses offered at Stuy, in addition to a decrease in Stuy’s number of rigorous courses. “A lot of classes are being phased out because the teachers who taught them are no longer here,” Peng said. “[Social Studies teacher George] Kennedy retired last year, and his popular Wall Street class is no longer offered. [Chemistry teacher] Dr. [Zhen Chuan] Li retired, and they took away higher level chemistry courses he brought to the table. Dr. Li was here when I was a student and really set the bar high in the chemistry department.”</p><p>Peng’s experiences as a Stuyvesant student have had a huge impact on his approach to teaching. He aims to improve upon the teaching methods he observed during his time at Stuyvesant. To do this, he actively implements new strategies in his teaching style to prepare students and accommodate their needs.</p><p>Peng encourages group-centered teaching and collaborative problem-solving. These were emphasized in his graduate program as the best methods of getting students to have balanced interactions. They help students feel more comfortable with addressing their lack of understanding with their peers and teachers. Different students understand things at different times. Students can interact and help each other get a firm grasp on the material in class, while Peng had to go back after a more ‘lecture-based’ class to consult with his teacher when he had difficulty.</p><p>In the end, Peng wants to make sure that students are well prepared for the Geometry Regents. With the implementation of the Common Core, the regents now requires students to think critically, surpassing surface-level thinking. Peng says this change was immediately noticeable when average scores dropped significantly. “I feel that, especially at a school as reputable as Stuy, this shouldn't happen,” Peng said. “These types of hard, complicated thinking-based questions are needed throughout the year for preparation.”</p><p>As a result, Peng relies on rigorous testing to determine whether students truly understand concepts. As a student, Peng always found Stuy’s exams to be tough. “I’m really lucky to be teaching [a fifth of the] freshman class. I want to make them understand [that] it just gets harder,” Peng said. “I can really emphasize to students that they need to develop strong study and work habits, as these really carry over.”</p><p>Peng also ensures that his students have adequate resources. He gives outlines for exams and offers services such as office hours and after-school help. “Students have really taken advantage of this, and [I] have seen their averages go up. I'm really glad to see this because it must be working,” Peng said.</p><p>Peng really feels that his experiences at Stuyvesant have shaped him into the man he is today and have taught him many valuable life skills. “The last two years have been really hectic for me. I got married, had a kid, am teaching in a new school, staying very late, and taking masters classes. All of these [life events] would be very overwhelming,” Peng said. “Stuy taught me time management, it taught me [how] to prioritize, and that I really can’t skim out the quality of my work. I [learned the importance of] putting the effort into all the facets of what I do. At Stuy, I had to multitask and had to stay on top of everything. This carries over throughout college, and you will see the difference. Within the competitive nature of college, you have to be on top of things. Coming from Stuy, you get this advantage. These carry over to life as well. You really don’t see it as a student in high school. But, those experiences and habits carry over.”</p><p>Peng has high hopes for his son, Derek. Though Derek is only 15 months old, Peng is already sending him to classes. “My wife and I will support him in anything he is interested in and wants to pursue. We won't force him into a corner,” Peng said.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:41:13.566586	3	1	“Oh my God, I just failed the Peng test,” someone whispers in the hall, his face gaunt with fear.

6	﻿The Heart of Compassionate Medicine	the-heart-of-compassionate-medicine	<p>The British High Court ordered the immediate removal of eleven-month-old Charlie Gard from mechanical ventilation this past July. At the time of his death, he could not hear or open his eyes without assistance, could not breathe on his own, had heart and kidney failure, and suffered chronic seizures.</p><p>Charlie was diagnosed with Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome (MDDS) when he was two months old. MDDS is an extremely rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the RRM2B protein. A dysfunctional form of this protein inevitably leads to muscle weakness, organ failure, and death.</p><p>The United States National Library of Medicine has only 15 other recorded cases of MDDS caused by the RRM2B mutation, none of which have been successfully treated. Earlier last year, Dr. Michio Hirano, the head neurologist at the Division of Neuromuscular Disorders at Columbia University Medical Center, set out to change that.</p><p>Hirano reached out to the medical team at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London (GOSH), where Charlie was being treated, to discuss his experimental nucleoside treatment. He believed it held a “theoretical possibility” of improving Charlie’s condition. However, an MRI revealed severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy—brain damage so severe that Hirano’s treatment, which would deal mainly with muscle atrophy, would prove futile.</p><p>As a result, GOSH began discussing the termination of Charlie’s life support and placing him in palliative care because there was such a limited chance that Hirano’s treatment would improve his quality of life. His doctors believed they were acting in Charlie’s best interest. His parents, however, felt it was their right to provide the treatment for their son.</p><p>In the U.K., disagreements between hospitals and parents are taken to the courts, where the court is expected to objectively determine whether or not continuing (or receiving) a treatment is in the child’s best interest. Both the English High Court and the European Court of Human Rights backed GOSH’s stance, and Charlie was taken off mechanical ventilation a week before his first birthday.</p><p>While in the U.S., it is ultimately up to the parents of children to decide whether or not they want to seek special permission to test these premature treatments; in the U.K., this decision is left up to the hospitals and courts. In fact, immediately following the European Court of Human Right’s decision, Charlie’s life support was set to be taken away on a date and time set by the hospital, not by his parents.</p><p>The long battle between England’s legal system and the hospital against Charlie’s parents raises questions concerning the rights and responsibilities of parents in determining medical treatment for their terminally ill children and the extent to which the government should get involved in these choices.</p><p>The type of medical treatment Charlie would have received is also known as compassionate medicine, which is the administration of drugs or treatments not approved by the FDA. It is used as a last resort on patients who have essentially run out of options. But hospitals have reservations about resorting to compassionate medicine because of the extreme risks it runs.</p><p>This makes the balance of power between the parents and the hospital an especially difficult one to strike; while a system which gives power to the parents often pressures doctors to perform treatments that they feel are a misdirected use of resources, a system like the one that Charlie’s parents claim condemned their son to death takes away the freedom of a patient to choose his or her medical options. The law essentially makes ethical decisions based on medical conjecture.</p><p>In an attempt to use public support to sway his doctors, Charlie’s parents raised over $2,000,000 on their GoFundMe online fundraiser, received support from President Trump and Pope Francis, and obtained an invitation from the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center to evaluate Charlie and carry out the experimental treatment, either in New York or in London.</p><p>Despite this popular support, the British government was able to block Charlie from receiving treatment in New York. Though Charlie’s condition at the time made it more than likely that nucleosome transfer wouldn’t make a difference in his life, his parents should have had the right to accept treatments even with a limited chance of success, given a few provisions. One is that parents should understand and accept the fact that compassionate medicine is nearly synonymous with risk. Doctors must take on the task of informing them about all exhaustible options so that the parents can make rational decisions.</p><p>Following that, the government should be kept as a third party with limited involvement in order to allow it to focus on streamlining the official drug approval process while also bypassing the socialized medicine argument. Compassionate medicine should not find itself dependent on public funds.</p><p>Unfortunately, all of the support Charlie received online also reveals how compassionate medicine’s projected legacy has been pushed and pulled to fit political agendas. Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan are attempting to use Charlie’s stories in order to dismantle the Obama administration’s healthcare system. Ryan recently tweeted, “Health care should be between patients and doctors. Government has no place in the life or death business.” Vice President Mike Pence attributed his death to “all the talk on the left.” Yet note that ultimately, it wasn’t the British government that condemned Charlie to die, but the combined efforts and professional advice of the doctors and the hospitals that treated him.</p><p>Using him as a poster boy against government involvement in healthcare purposefully discounts the nuances of his story. The crux of Charlie’s story and the heart of medicine as a whole does not have to do with the morals of public healthcare. It has to do with parents and the law being able to reach a common ground and the definition of a child’s best interest.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:42:12.698665	2	1	Patients should have the right to choose experimental treatments, but its role with the government and politics should be reconsidered.
7	﻿Still No Cellphones?	still-no-cellphones	<p>The late bell rings in unison with a buzzing in your pocket as you tread past the second-floor scanners. You glance discreetly at your cellphone, only to find the pressing alert is a mere Facebook notification. The relief, however, is short-lived as a teacher materializes in the periphery of your vision. After an awkward exchange and a disapproving frown, your electronic is on its way to the dean’s office.</p><p>Getting cheated by the cellphone policy is an unofficial rite of passage for every Stuyvesant student. In an elite school that boasts some of the best computer science and technology classes in the nation, the administration's approach toward electronics remains surprisingly obsolete.</p><p>The newest NYCDOE cellphone policy, which came into effect in March 2015, permitted the usage of “cellphones and other electronic devices [in] the building.” But, backlash from a prior cheating scandal forced Stuyvesant to prolong its draconian cellphone policy. The hotly debated policy, endorsed by a majority of the Stuyvesant administration as well as Mayor Bloomberg, was an attempt to crack down on cheating at a time when it was prevalent at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Years later, current students are subject to the same ineffectual policy. A recent study by the Pew Research Center finds that even in schools that ban electronics entirely, up to 58 percent of students continue to use phones, an insubstantial decrease from 71 percent in schools with no such restrictions. Between the clean slates and multiple offenders, no one truly stops using their cellphones in school; they just get better at hiding it.</p><p>Instead of continuing to enforce this policy, it’s time for the administration to start vouching for a more positive alternative. Other specialized high schools, such as Brooklyn Tech and Staten Island Tech, have begun integrating cell phones into their curricula. Students are encouraged to download software that allows easy access to art programs, spreadsheets, and dictionaries, as well as to use cellphones as a medium for research and internet access when no other electronics are available. Teaching students how to use cellphones productively encourages participation and even saves money. The National Education Association dubbed cellphones “cost effective for schools.”</p><p>Similarly, about 73 percent of teachers agree that cellphones serve as helpful learning aids. Use of these technologies in classrooms can motivate disengaged students, improving their relationship with the administration. Instead of a hostile environment in which students feel a lack of trust from teachers forced to follow the regulations set by the cellphone policy, a more relaxed atmosphere is fostered.</p><p>The strict regulations of the cellphone policy are enforced through a two-strike system. A first offense requires the student to wait until after 10th period to retrieve their phone. For students who are involved in extracurricular activities or have lengthy commutes, this can produce an inconvenient deviation to an already packed schedule.</p><p>A second offense demands that the student’s legal guardian retrieve the device. This works to unfairly punish the wrong person, causing interruptions in a busy work-life and unnecessary trips for legal guardians who reside far from the school.</p><p>When a guardian is unavailable, the student is forced to commute without a phone. Anything (being lost, extended train delays, a mugging) that transpires in the period of time their cellphone remains at school may have been easily defused by its presence. According to NBC News, up to 85 percent of students felt safer with a cellphone on their person. It’s a liability to essentially “disarm” students, as well as to deprive them of their peace of mind.</p><p>A better replacement for the current cellphone policy is a three-strike system, in which the harsher punishment of a guardian retrieving the device would only be necessary after three confiscations. Similarly, requiring a parent to be aware their child got their phone confiscated and having their consent to return it rather than their physical presence would be a step in the right direction.</p><p>Stuyvesant upholds an impressive reputation, but the cellphone policy hinders the sort of progress that sets apart our school from the rest. Antiquated policies that exist for the sake of trying to mend a once-tarnished reputation need to be revoked, the sooner the better.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:42:31.526462	2	1	In an elite school that boasts some of the best computer science and technology classes in the nation, the administration's approach toward electronics remains surprisingly obsolete.
8	﻿Greater Than Grenfell	greater-than-grenfell	<p>“The majority of the building’s residents were low-income—according to Vox, many of them were immigrants and refugees from Syria, Sudan, and Eritrea.”</p><p>Three years ago, brothers Mohammed Alhajali and Omar Alhajali fled Syria. Though the journey was dangerous, they escaped to the U.K., became university students, and successfully began new lives. But everything changed on the night of June 14, when a refrigerator caught fire inside Behailu Kebede’s fourth-floor apartment at the Grenfell Tower.</p><p>The fire spread more rapidly than anyone had anticipated, leaping up the building’s exterior and engulfing it in a matter of minutes. The Alhajalis tried to escape from the 14th floor together, but were separated in the tower’s single stairwell. While Omar eventually found his way out, Mohammed did not.</p><p>Mohammed Alhajali became the first of at least 80 people pronounced dead in the Grenfell Tower fire. Though the fire took place months ago, the official death toll is expected to be announced in 2018, and will likely have three figures.</p><p>The tragedy of this fire, however, doesn’t solely lie in the death count, or in how long the building burned (about 60 hours), but in the way that this fire was completely preventable. Simply put, Grenfell Tower was a death trap where simple changes could have saved numerous lives.</p><p>The building lacked fire escapes, alarms, and sprinklers. According to survivor accounts, its single staircase turned out to be catastrophically crowded during the fire. In addition, the building’s recently-installed insulation and cladding contained flammable materials—elements that played a key role in spreading the fire to the building’s other floors.</p><p>Some of the reasons why such obvious safety hazards were overlooked seem to revolve around who the residents of Grenfell Tower—and their neighbors—were. Grenfell Tower is located in Kensington, an extremely wealthy neighborhood with one of Britain’s largest wealth gaps. In fact, the majority of the building’s residents were low-income—according to Vox, many of them were immigrants and refugees from Syria (like the Alhajalis), Sudan, and Eritrea. Grenfell Tower is considered social housing, meaning that the rent is legally supposed to be kept at an affordable price for low-income residents.</p><p>Over time, however, some of the units in Grenfell Tower were rented at more expensive rates as a money-hungry management willingly turned a blind eye in the hopes of profiting. For the same reason, the surrounding area became increasingly gentrified as local councils—namely, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization—attempted to attract wealthier folk and cover up Kensington’s poorer areas.</p><p>Grenfell Tower underwent various renovations as part of the management’s efforts to disguise the area’s poverty and appeal to rich prospective tenants. One of these renovations was a seemingly innocuous yet highly flammable version of exterior cladding (a material that covered Grenfell Tower in a shell in order to beautify it), and the rest is history.</p><p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of the entire incident is the way the local management willingly overlooked the basic safety needs of the poorer residents in the area in an effort to attract wealthier ones, even though Grenfell Tower’s tenants repeatedly filed complaints and attempted to draw the issue to the management’s attention.</p><p>Accompanying this neglect is the implication that the lives of minorities and the poor hold less value relative to the lives of the privileged. To hold social housing to a lower standard counters the mission of social housing entirely, which is to provide a safe and secure home for the disadvantaged and those in dire financial circumstances.</p><p>There are steps that must be taken to prevent a needless disaster of this nature from occurring again. The most immediately obvious one is that Britain should ban flammable cladding on tall buildings, like the United States and several other countries have already. Cladding wasn’t already banned chiefly because business-friendly politicians in Britain have long campaigned to free businesses from the weight of safety regulations.</p><p>The British government must now prioritize the basic safety needs of its citizens over big business, beginning by inspecting other buildings for the kind of cladding that spurred this fire’s growth and removing it when found.</p><p>More importantly, in addition to providing stronger government oversight of businesses and housing management, the British government should fully dedicate itself to ensuring that all former residents of Grenfell Tower are able to come forward for treatment and help without repercussions. Though Prime Minister Theresa May initially promised that anyone affected by the tragedy would receive government support (i.e. accommodation and healthcare) with no regard to their immigration status, she later went back on her word and stated that anyone coming forward for help would be subject to normal immigration rules.</p><p>Doing background checks puts undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation and will likely discourage them from coming forward to receive the attention they need. This is not the time to be performing immigration checks; the least May can do is guarantee that everyone, regardless of immigration status, receives the necessary care.</p><p>It is beyond tragic that a catastrophe of this nature is needed to reveal the disastrous consequences that gentrification can have. The Grenfell Action Group warned that only a catastrophic fire would convince the management to finally take fire safety regulations seriously last November, yet no one listened until the building was engulfed in flames.</p><p>Grenfell’s tragedy holds a striking similarity to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. Both are chilling evidence of corporations that prioritize profit over citizens, workers, and residents, and of a government that blatantly neglects those at the bottom of society. Investigations into the causes of the Grenfell Fire, as well as whether the local management can be charged with corporate manslaughter, are still underway. We can only hope that they will bring about rightful and long-awaited change.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:42:46.552069	2	1	The Grenfell Fire, more than being a senseless tragedy, reveals disturbing socioeconomic imbalances and is a failure on the government’s part.
9	A Discussion on Discussion	a-discussion-on-discussion	<p>“...this prejudice hasn’t been erased, but rather has evolved.”</p><p>Areas like New York City and Silicon Valley have long been acknowledged as places that lean politically left, a culture that remains pervasive both at school and in the workplace. But recently, James Damore, a former engineer at Google, released an internal memo in an act of rebellion that challenged these ideas of liberalism and equality.</p><p>Following the implementation of a diversity program at Google intended to help the company fight bias in the workplace, Damore voices his thoughts in a memo titled “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber.” In it, he outlines inherent differences between men and women, suggesting that women have a propensity for lower stress jobs because of their genetic predisposition for “neuroticism,” which "may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs." And, since they generally have an interest in “people rather than things,” he suggests that they may be better suited for jobs in “social or artistic areas,” especially since he claims women have a higher level of “agreeableness” that makes them unsuited for leadership positions.</p><p>Many of his coworkers were quick to condemn him for sexism and promoting harmful gender stereotypes, including the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai. Others, however, sent him personal messages applauding his bravery for opening up discussion. They claimed they were afraid to openly show support because of political discrimination. In our current political climate, many Americans, including our own president, have spoken out about feeling suffocated by political correctness, which they argue shames dissenters into silence.</p><p>But this so-called “political suffocation” should by no means be used as justification to promote ideas that are blatantly sexist and foster harmful stereotypes.</p><p>Damore did succeed in bringing attention to his ideas. Yet he was not successful in proving his own claims because he shared erroneous information that threatened to reverse strides made in closing the gender gap. For instance, despite Damore’s simplistic view of the neuroticism of women, personality traits are qualitative, meaning any data gathered from research conducted by psychologists can be interpreted in hundreds of ways. Even David Schmitt, the director of the study cited by Damore in his memo, has voiced disagreement with Damore’s analysis, saying, “It is unclear to me that this sex difference would play a role in success within the Google workplace.”</p><p>This is not an isolated event, but part of a long trend in which men reinforce age-old gender stereotypes that allow this bias to persevere. For instance, in 2005, Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard, gave a statement crediting the shortage of successful women in science to a lack of an “innate ability” to perform as well as men in certain academic disciplines. Similarly, in 2015, Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital gave a statement in an interview saying he would consider hiring more women in the future, but he didn’t want to “lower the standards” of the company.</p><p>As a country, we’ve spent decades trying to reverse a history of oppression. Yet it’s clear that this prejudice hasn’t been erased, merely evolved. Many people have gone from believing that women are incapable of joining the workforce to thinking that they’re incapable of holding senior positions because their supposedly more caring nature makes them better suited for jobs like teaching. Sexism still lingers, and the many incidents involving insensitive comments made by men expressing their outdated opinions serve to reinforce these ideas.</p><p>Many people take advantage of online forums to express controversial opinions, even illegitimate ones with no scientific backing. Similarly, Google allows its employees to engage in discussion through internal messages. However, Damore argues that “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.”</p><p>The problem at hand actually goes beyond Google’s political agenda. This isn’t an issue of silencing conservatives or shunning the ideas of someone who simply wants to stimulate discussion—it’s an issue of a Google employee who decided to immaturely attack women and their role in the tech industry. Though Google decided to fire Damore for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes” and rightly chose to prioritize their female employees, the impact of his memo will be felt for years to come.</p><p>Damore’s baseless conclusions, which have been drawn by multiple men in the past, will only serve to increase hostility in the workplace and increase the wage gap. His ideas are discouraging to women trying to pursue a career in the STEM field, and they have no scientific backing.</p><p>Ultimately, open discussion is essential for honest and intelligent discourse. But honesty and intelligence stem from being informed and having tact, something that is much harder to come by.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:44:21.709372	2	1	The freedom of open discussion is not as important as being mindful of sensitive issues related to our history of oppression.
10	Trumping Science: Trump’s War against Reality	trumping-science-trump-s-war-against-reality	<p>During his campaign season, President Donald Trump claimed that climate change was a Chinese hoax. He demanded “no more massive injections” in an unfounded critique of vaccines. He went as far as to describe reports denying a link between vaccines and autism as “fudged up.” Unsurprisingly, Trump and his administration have changed the role the federal government plays in science, and in the process have altered one of the most important partnerships in the modern world.</p><p>One of the evident ways the Trump administration has damaged this relationship is through the implementation of policies that contradict the scientific consensus. For instance, this past June, Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which was widely condemned by the scientific community. This pivotal decision will slow the U.S.'s transition toward renewable energy, have diplomatic repercussions that come with abandoning an international agreement, and result in economic costs in the long term.</p><p>Indicative of Trump’s indifference toward the opinions of the scientific community, this decision disregarded the overwhelming amount of evidence that humans are a primary cause of climate change and failed to consider the arguments of 800 earth science and energy experts across 46 states who penned an open letter to the president asking that he change his climate policy.</p><p>A less publicized but still important example of the Trump administration's disregard of science is Environment Protection Agency (EPA) director Scott Pruitt’s refusal to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos. In doing so, he rejected the EPA’s conclusion that it leaves unsafe levels of residue on crops and has severe neurological effects on developing children.</p><p>Refusing to accept scientific fact appears to be a trend in the Trump administration. The president is also known to support the existence of a link between vaccines and autism, saying as recently as three years ago, “I am being proven right about massive vaccinations—the doctors lied.” Such comments misinform and unnecessarily alarm the public, the opposite of what the government-science relationship is intended to do.</p><p>Not only has Trump created an environment in which baseless claims wield more power than ones accepted by the scientific community, he has also distanced people from their impact on the environment. According to a series of e-mails with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Trump administration told the USDA to “stop using terms” like “climate change,” “greenhouse gases,” and other phrases that imply human cause, and to instead use terms such as “weather extremes” to communicate with farmers. Such terms take away all sense of human responsibility for today’s environmental issues and promote non-intervention, countering  acts to increase awareness of such issues.</p><p>Moreover, the Trump administration has been suppressing scientific progress by withholding information regarding meetings behind scientific decisions and minimizing press interaction instead of emphasizing transparency. In fact, the EPA has been sued in order for it to comply with the law and publicly release records of meetings regarding the Clean Water Act, which would impact acres of wetlands in the U.S. and the many endangered species that live on them. It has also removed mentions of Obama’s Climate Action Plan and promises of UN climate reform on federal websites.</p><p>In addition to the EPA, the Departments of Energy, Interior, and State have also been sued for censorship in their records. Even more directly, Trump has cut federal funding from major organizations such as NASA and the National Institute of Health. For instance, NASA’s Earth Science budget will drop by 11 percent, losing more than $217 million in funding. Similarly, the EPA will have its lowest budget of the past 40 years, losing 30 percent of all funding. Other programs dedicated to research and disease prevention, such as the National Cancer Institute and the Institute of Health, will lose up to $6 billion in funds.</p><p>While those with political power should be making evidence-based claims and supporting scientific progress, Trump’s blatant attempts to stir up hysteria over baseless facts reflect an inappropriate relationship he and his administration currently hold with the country. Ideally, there should be a balance of power between government and science, with continuous support and growth in each of them.</p><p>This ideal relationship existed during Obama’s presidency. In Obama’s eight years of presidency, he and his administration proposed new programs for energy and climate change, selected renowned scientists to lead his programs, enforced regulations to preserve the environment, worked with a Republican-dominated Congress to fund new research, and promoted the importance of science in both the present and for future generations.</p><p>In contrast, Trump’s administration emphasizes the strained state of the relationship between government and science. As government and science both strive to better the lives of the people, it is imperative that they cooperate rather than compete. Scientific facts are an objective and reliable metric for the validity of an idea or theory. As an institution that is held to the highest standards of honesty and reliability, it is the government's duty to support its scientists, not undermine them.</p><p>The government should support scientists working on projects too large for the private sector, such as combating climate change or developing space travel. At the same time, it should make sure science remains ethical through regulations prohibiting practices such as human cloning. Through such cooperation, the government can create an environment that promotes scientific development and creates a more informed public and a brighter future for humanity.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:44:48.470986	2	1	Scientific facts are the most objective and reliable metric for the validity of an idea or theory.

11	﻿Reframing Affirmative Action at Stuyvesant	reframing-affirmative-action-at-stuyvesant	<p>“Any concerns I have are somehow invalidated because I am both Black and Latino,” senior Eugene Thomas said. “Every single time I’ve ever discussed college, I’ve been told, ‘You're gonna get in wherever you want. Let's face it: you're black!’ like it's some proverbial golden ticket into the top universities.”</p><p>Affirmative Action is a divisive practice that is often perceived to benefit Black and Latino students at the expense of White and Asian students during the college admissions process. As demonstrated by Thomas’s comment, many people, Stuyvesant students included, erroneously see Affirmative Action as a race-based quota that acts as a gateway for Black and Latino students simply by virtue of skin color and regardless of qualification.</p><p>But this isn’t a “Black versus Asian” dilemma — it’s not a zero-sum game, and a successful black student is not a rival but a deserving peer. Affirmative Action is meant to counter historical forms of discrimination, and regardless of whether the Supreme Court strikes down Affirmative Action, universities like Harvard will continue to strive to represent the best version of America, and that means diversity.</p><p>The History of Affirmative Action</p><p>In reality, Affirmative Action has a much less specific definition than race-based quotas in admissions. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, requiring government contractors and employers to take "affirmative action" to ensure that applicants and employees were not discriminated against based upon their “race, creed, color, or national origin." President Lyndon B. Johnson then added gender as a clause. The order was implemented to curb prejudice and discrimination against any individual American.</p><p>Affirmative Action historically helped Asian immigrants who were poor and non-English speakers. From 1981 to 1996, the percentage of bachelor’s degrees earned by Asian Americans grew from 2 to 5.5 percent, which is significantly faster than their population growth, per the US Census Bureau.</p><p>Opponents of affirmative action have always held that the policy discriminates against white Americans. Edward Blum, an anti-affirmative action activist, sued the University of Texas at Austin for disfavoring white applicants in 2009. Last year, in a 4-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the university and emphasized the importance of diversity in education.</p><p>The decision was controversial, and Justice Alito wrote in a dissenting opinion that it would hurt Asian Americans. Blum has used Alito’s dissent to co-opt Asian Americans into his white nationalist agenda, and is suing Harvard University for discriminating against Asian American applicants. Stuyvesant and three other high schools with large Asian American populations have been subpoenaed for the lawsuit.</p><p>Many point to the achievements of minority groups such as Asian- and Jewish- Americans as proof that the United States is a functioning meritocracy.</p><p>However, large numbers of Asians only began to immigrate into the United States following the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which allowed Asians into the country under the condition that they were well educated. White supremacists then falsely claimed high levels of Asian American education were a product of the United States, rather than the various immigrants’ countries of origin. Thus, Asian Americans were labeled as the “model minority,” and the Civil Rights Movement was attacked as a tool that benefitted other “problem” minorities.</p><p>Despite the legal end to segregation in 1964, redlining (policies that prevent minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods) and white flight (when more affluent families abandon certain neighborhoods) are among several factors that continue to force African Americans and Latinos to settle in much poorer neighborhoods. In turn, they have a poor public education system and stand to gain from policies like Affirmative Action.</p><p>“Colorblind Policies Make a Colorblind World”</p><p>Many Stuyvesant students would describe the SHSAT as the “ultimate equalizer,” giving everyone an equal chance to have a quality education and thus find economic success. Through colorblind testing, the SHSAT is supposedly a step toward a colorblind society.</p><p>Thousands of Asian Americans accepted into elite high schools based on a colorblind exam want to believe that colorblind policies work and that these should be adopted by the college admissions process. The notion that so-called  colorblind admissions policies are actually products of systemic oppression might appear to invalidate the accomplishments of Stuyvesant students and be detrimental to the school’s large Asian American population.</p><p>Colorblind education policies are, however, a myopic approach to inequality that continue to play host to systemic racism, such as redlining and white flight, which has resulted in massive failures and what the DOE describes as “modern-day segregation.”</p><p>The logic of race neutrality leaves segments of the Stuyvesant community complicit in a white nationalist agenda: “If Asian Americans found success without race-based assistance, Black and Latinos should be able to do so without Affirmative Action.”</p><p>But Affirmative Action is ultimately about creating a diverse student body. Many Asian cultures place a heavy emphasis on examinations and view them as objective measurements of achievement. Even if exams could be truly objective, Harvard doesn’t really care, and doesn’t want a student body comprised of competent test takers; there are simply too many other traits, including talent, individuality, and even background, that can’t be quantified by standardized testing.</p><p>It is also important to note that homogenizing Asian Americans into a single group is a ploy by Edward Blum and a white nationalist agenda. While Chinese, Korean, and Indian Americans have educational success, many Southeast Asian immigrants, including Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian Americans, drop out of high school at rates approaching 40 percent, per The New York Times. Don’t get caught up in the rhetoric of an “Asian America,” because Affirmative Action also provides aid for many Asian immigrants.</p><p>White nationalists don’t want a meritocracy when it doesn’t benefit them — though they support colorblind admissions at Harvard, they are heavily opposed to them in California, where Affirmative Action is banned. According to the New York Times, they have called the Asian American student population “the hordes of Asians.” Edward Blum is not looking out for Asian Americans—he has systematically brought several pieces of key civil rights legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, before the Supreme Court to have them struck down, which has disenfranchised many Asian immigrants.</p><p>Affirmative Action for Women</p><p>Often, the fight for women’s suffrage came at the cost of equal rights legislation for African Americans. In fact, women’s suffrage advocates Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony refused to support the 15th Amendment, aligning instead with racist Southerners who argued that women’s votes could be used to offset those of African Americans.</p><p>And what’s horrific is that this isn’t just an isolated incident. Time and time again, women are willing to tear down racial minorities in order to further their own success.</p><p>Today, may women argue against race-based affirmative action policies. “Many times, students fixate on race instead of the fact that many females benefit from affirmative action in STEM fields,” senior Sammie Paul said. Helping women in STEM is undoubtedly important, but is not mutually exclusive with helping minorities.</p><p>In general, many polls have shown that a much larger portion of Americans support gender-based affirmative action than those who support race-based affirmative action, proving that most Americans do not understand that both types of affirmative action come from the same executive order.</p><p>In Conclusion</p><p>The backlash against Affirmative Action reveals a clear misunderstanding of the purpose of the practice. Colleges are tasked with creating a student body that is capable of thriving and accepting students who have something to add to the university and the experiences of other students.</p><p>Affirmative Action not only seeks to give all students a fair chance at top universities, but it takes into account the different obstacles students of various races and backgrounds must overcome.</p><p>Senior Anna Pacheco, who was the only Latina in her predominantly Asian prep school, recounts her prep teacher always telling her that she didn’t have to try as hard in tests since she was Puerto Rican.</p><p>Let this be clear: students don’t get in "just because they're black/Hispanic/women." While it is true that colleges want a diverse student body, that diversity does not only mean race. The diversity they are looking for includes other factors such as location, intended majors, and types of extracurriculars. And increased diversity can have positive effects, both socially and academically, such as exposing students to different ideals and ways of thinking, as well as helping to improve both short and long term race relations.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:45:06.818426	8	1	“Any concerns I have are somehow invalidated because I am both Black and Latino,” senior Eugene Thomas said. “Every single time I’ve ever discussed college, I’ve been told, ‘You're gonna get in wherever you want.

12	﻿A Wonder of a Feminist	a-wonder-of-a-feminist	<p>It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…a woman?</p><p>Indeed, “Wonder Woman” retells the origin story of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), the princess of the Amazons, who is one of the secluded female warriors created by the Greek god Zeus. But when American pilot and spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is rescued by Diana and reveals the chaos of World War I to the Amazons, Diana decides to go with him to put an end to the global conflict by detecting and killing the god of war, Ares, who she believes to be responsible for the war.</p><p>Though the premise of the movie seems to be a typical “hero beats villain in epic fighting scene and saves the day” plotline (especially similar to superhero-war film and origin story “Captain America: The First Avenger”), “Wonder Woman” distinguishes itself by focusing on exploring Diana’s character instead of constant, action-packed fighting.</p><p>From the very start of the movie, Diana is depicted as thirsty for action, wanting to train like other Amazons and defend the world. However, upon entering grim, devastated Europe, she sees the horrific casualties of World War I with her own eyes. And with villains such as General Ludendorff (Danny Huston), a bloodthirsty patriot determined to defend his country, and Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), a brilliant yet sadistic chemist attempting to create new, devastating chemical weapons in order to win the war, Diana’s ideal views of mankind begin to falter. As she witnesses the brutality that humans are willing to subject each other to in their desire to succeed, she questions whether humanity is worth protecting.</p><p>Of course, that isn’t to say that “Wonder Woman” is completely barren of action. One scene, for instance, depicts Diana refusing to listen to Steve’s cynical mindset and crossing No Man’s Land alone, while deflecting enemy bullets and bombs. As she charges forward unyieldingly, the Allied soldiers begin to follow her lead and step out of their trench, fighting the German troops. It’s breathtaking to watch the vibrant Diana, surrounded by a landscape of grays and blues, stand up to an army of men and lead her allies to victory.</p><p>It is moments such as the iconic No Man’s Land scene that contribute to Wonder Woman’s title as a feminist icon. Throughout the film, Diana is told what she can or cannot do as a woman by countless men. However, she ignores the standard societal expectations of women that she has no place in fighting and that she should simply wear pretty dresses for men to gaze at. She continues to wear her own armor, barge into private military meetings, and triumph over soldiers because that is what will help others. Even though men may call her naive or tell her she cares too much about others, Diana’s determination and empathy make her Wonder Woman and lead her to defy them.</p><p>In fact, despite Diana and Steve’s constant bickering, their somewhat reluctant alliance eventually grows into a charming romance; Diana still remains firm in her ideals and decisions, even if Steve disapproves. One instance portraying this consists of Steve trying to stop Diana from killing Ludendorff, who worries about her hastiness, to which she responds, “What I do is not up to you.” This line truly embodies Wonder Woman’s feminism, as it shows how Diana does not need a man in order for her to be a hero—she just needs to stay true to herself.</p><p>But Diana isn’t the only one empowering other women—Patty Jenkins, the director of “Wonder Woman” and the first female director of an American studio superhero movie, has achieved many records, including “Wonder Woman” becoming the highest grossing film directed by a woman (grossing over $797 million worldwide) and the DC Extended Universe’s most critically successful film (competing against other films such as “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Suicide Squad”). Meanwhile, in 2016, women comprised just seven percent of all directors of the top 250 domestic grossing films. Perhaps Jenkins’s accomplishments with “Wonder Woman” will be the start of more women obtaining opportunities in the filmmaking industry.</p><p>With the success of “Wonder Woman” and an upcoming sequel, hopefully, Diana Prince will inspire other women to be proud of their gender for a lifetime.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:45:27.327382	13	1	“Wonder Woman” is a spectacular superhero film focusing on Diana Prince’s character and feminist mindset.
13	The Legacy that “Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812” Left Behind	the-legacy-that-natasha-pierre-and-the-great-comet-of-1812-left-behind	<p>Cozily nestled in the bustling streets of Times Square, the Imperial Theater was a world unto itself as an eager audience was introduced to rapturous, 19th century Russia. Written by Leo Tolstoy, “War and Peace” (1869) took on a new life in the Broadway musical, “Natasha, Pierre, and The Great Comet of 1812.” The two hour and 30 minute long production illustrated the decadent affair between the young and wide-eyed Natasha Rostova (played by Denee Benton) and the handsome, though already married, Anatole (played by Lucas Steele) as she waited for her beloved fiance, Prince Andrey (played by Nicholas Belton), to return home from war.</p><p>Interestingly quirky and brilliant, “The Great Comet” was declared Broadway’s “next ‘Hamilton’”—both similar in their aim of depicting dense, historical novels as well as their ever-rising rate of success. 12 Tony nominations, the most of any production in 2017, were a confirmation of this success. Yet, the production came to a screeching halt with its final performance on September 3rd, with controversial casting marking the end of an incredibly successful four year run.The end ultimately began in late July, when a financial scare prompted the show’s creator, Dave Malloy, to replace the actor of Pierre, Okieriete “Oak” Onaodowan, an African American best known for playing a supporting role in Hamilton, with Mandy Patinkin, a well-known, white actor who had starred in the famous 1987 “The Princess Bride.”</p><p>Only a few weeks prior was Onaodowan chosen to replace the original actor, Josh Groban. Yet a month into the show’s run with Onaodowan, ticket sales dropped to $900,000 a week, which contrasted to the $1.2 million a week that Groban had brought when he played Pierre. In a panicked effort to boost publicity and ticket sales, Malloy called in Patinkin to step in the role, in the hopes that the revered name would help sell the show.</p><p>The announcement unleashed a wave of angry protests on social media, as many defended Onaodowan and bluntly pointed out the racism that was involved in the casting replacement. Soon afterwards, Patinkin declined the offer, possibly afraid that in accepting it, he would elicit an even more vehement response on social media. Subsequently, Onaodowan announced on Instagram that his last performance would be on August 13th and that he would not be returning due to the second-rate treatment he received as a black actor. With the debacle leaving neither Patinkin nor Onaodowan to play Pierre, Malloy was left to take on the responsibility to play Pierre for the last three weeks of its run.</p><p>Though racial discrimination is, unfortunately, not an uncommon occurrence in the entertainment industry, the producers’ decisions in this case proved to be an incongruous one; the show had received high praise for its diversity, especially with African American actress Denee Benton playing the lead role in a script that doesn’t necessarily warrant people of color to play the characters. Having had made great strides in giving minorities a larger platform, the decision to replace Onaodowan ultimately led the show to retrogress to a state where white people are evidently valued more.</p><p>But despite this debacle being an ingrained part of the show’s brief history, it should be made clear that the controversy should not define “The Great Comet”’s legacy. Even if it was not one that could be easily forgiven, nor forgotten, by many, the casting choice was a mistake. If one could disregard the controversy, even momentarily, it would be agreed upon that “The Great Comet” was an unforgettable Broadway masterpiece, having had done unprecedented things that delightfully deviated from the traditions in Broadway theater.</p><p>For one, its score is unlike any other, as it is difficult to pinpoint one specific genre. Critics have instead characterized the score as an “electro-pop opera,” and as it suggests, it was a mesh of electronic-dance music, folk music, opera and pop. This combination of old and modern genres livened the story with an interesting twist.</p><p>The stage poses as another one of the show’s groundbreaking elements. Instead of making the actors and audience two discrete entities with a traditional stage, the set is designed so that there are bits and pieces of stage around the room, intertwining the actors, audience, and band together. The ensemble covered every part of the theater, and they had no qualms with interacting with the audience, inviting them to be part of the story and making them the butt of a multitude of jokes.</p><p>Another facet that must not be overlooked was its grandiose lighting. Elaborate golden chandeliers and light bulbs, hung against the backdrop of sweeping red velvet curtains, embodied the formidable explosion of comets. The light playfully followed along to every song while casting a romantic aura over the room. Even the table stand lamps present in every row of seats played a part of the elaborate light repertoire.</p><p>From its breathtaking lighting, to the meticulously crafted costumes, to the myriad of exuberant dancing scenes that would erupt the theater into a delightful chaos, it is no doubt that “The Great Comet” excels in many categories. Yet, arguably the most memorable facet that Broadway will take away was the profound portrayal of its story. “The Great Comet” was able to take a trite plot line that has been used in a plethora of other stories over centuries of literature and allow the audience to see more than the superficiality of a treacherous affair between a beautiful princess and an alluring man.</p><p>Instead, we learn to recognize the grueling dilemma that young Natasha is burdened with and how one decision has the devastating capacity to ultimately to ruin her and her family. We see the great extent of the genuine compassion and worry that one can have for another human being in Natasha’s cousin and closest friend, Sonya (played by Ingrid Michaelson), as she emotionally dedicates herself to protecting Natasha from disgracing her name. We meet Pierre, an old, wealthy aristocrat who is unhappily married and cannot find a substantial reason to exist but still is able to muster compassion in his heart for a heartbroken friend.</p><p>“The Great Comet” culminates in a climactic ending: the falling of the comet itself. The show doesn’t make a contrived effort to present an emerging hero from a fog nor a glossy ending to a tumultuous affair. There is only complication and uncertainty. Pierre sings one last song—a haunting and poignant aria narrating the fall of the comet. But instead of panic or despair of the destruction that will soon befall them, he joyfully accepts the fate ahead. While listening to the aria, one may even draw a semblance between the show and the comet in one of its lyrics: both were unforgettable forces that travelled “with inexpressible speed through immeasurable space,” only for them to “suddenly have stopped… like an arrow piercing the earth.”</p><p>No doubt in mind, “The Great Comet” was nothing short of rapturous, exquisite, funny, and imbued with an enthralling decadence at its core. But the sincere and heartfelt moments were what allowed the show to rise up above most others to become a truly indelible mark in Broadway history. This is not to assert that this racial issue is far less important than its brilliant facets or that it can be forgotten or glossed over. But there is no denying that it is indeed a pity that this was to happen―a pity that the show ended and a pity that we are once again reminded that as a society, we are still far from reaching racial equality in the entertainment industry. But even despite the issue, one can only wish for “The Great Comet” to return to Broadway soon and to have learned from its mistakes. And hopefully, the rest of Broadway can learn too, the good, as well as the bad.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:46:13.152705	18	1	Cozily nestled in the bustling streets of Times Square, the Imperial Theater was a world unto itself as an eager audience was introduced to rapturous,...
291	﻿Uzbekistan: A Model For Progress	uzbekistan-a-model-for-progress	<p>The headlines today are not an encouraging sight. Germany, Europe’s most populous country, has failed to form a functional government and Angela Merkel’s 12-year stand as the leader of Western ideals is being threatened. Donald Trump continues to promote his populist positions and Brexit slowly chugs along. Rodrigo Duterte continues a campaign of extrajudicial crime-fighting criminals in the Philippines. It seems the tide of right-wing populism will not cease soon.</p><p>But an unlikely region of the world, Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, is undergoing a stage of liberalization, a remarkable development given its geography and the global trend toward autocracy. By making both political and economic reforms, Uzbekistan is showing that liberalism still has a place in the world, even in countries that used to be brutally repressive.</p><p>From the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 to last year, Uzbeks had known only one leader, President Islam Karimov. A ruthless autocrat, Karimov quashed the independent media with an iron fist. Journalists who did not support the government were thrown in jail for extraordinary amounts of time. One of these journalists, Muhammad Bekjanov, served 18 years in prison for contributing to the newspaper of the main opposition party in Uzbekistan. Bekjanov endured grotesque torture and served time in prisons with names such as “Goodbye to Youth.” Karimov even imprisoned members of his own family on suspicion that they were plotting against him.</p><p>However, last year, Karimov died suddenly and his Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev replaced him. Given his long tenure in the Karimov government, one would expect Mirziyoyev to continue his predecessor's ways.</p><p>Instead, he has started to reform Uzbekistan economically and politically. He allowed banks and companies to exchange foreign currencies at the market rate instead of at artificial, government-set rates. Mirziyoyev also toured the neighboring countries of Russia and China to promote Uzbekistan’s new openness to foreign investment. With a population of 30 million, Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia and investors regard it as a significant opportunity as the country is relatively undeveloped.</p><p>Even more remarkably, the country is liberalizing politically. Sixteen political prisoners have been released since Mirziyoyev took office and talk shows have more free expression. Uzbekistan’s notorious forced labor system, where college students and youth were forced to pick cotton, has been curtailed and the country has risen in the World Corruption Index.</p><p>Some say these actions are just a feint to open up Western sanctions on Uzbek cotton, which is not impossible. But even if minimal progress is made for the sake of growing the Uzbek economy, the world will be a better place. Central Asia has long been a black hole where democracy goes to die, but Uzbekistan is providing a welcome change from this narrative.</p><p>Mirziyoyev is not a saint, either. Some journalists have been arrested since he took power and the feared head of the Uzbek version of the KGB remains in power. However, progress cannot be made overnight.</p><p>Formerly, the U.S. State Department would promote such reforms around the world through peaceful means. However, under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the State Department has been undergoing an eight percent reduction in staff and faces a 31 percent budget cut from the Trump administration. This has been an obscene abdication of American leadership when the world perhaps needs it most. In an era when President Trump is championing “America First” along with rejecting leadership on the global stage, it is heartening to see American ideals taking root in formerly authoritarian countries.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 17:48:54.56994	2	1	Uzbekistan is a rare bright spot in a world that seems to be lurching towards right-wing authoritarianism.

67	﻿Photoville	photoville	<p>Since 2011, United Photo Industries has been showcasing photography from professionals and amateurs alike in a uniquely organized set of galleries called Photoville. It’s free, out in the open, and presents pieces that range from disturbing to inspiring. There are also various book signings, photography workshops, and nighttime movie screenings. For two weeks in August, Photoville premieres its pieces along the waterfront of Brooklyn Bridge Park, where out-of-commission shipping containers are reused to showcase photography and the occasional painting. The containers are all darkly lit and each contains an exhibit that highlights Photoville’s main theme: to “discover” what the media doesn’t say and delve into the implications of the media’s silence.</p><p>Besides the shipping containers, what stands out most is the content of the artwork. Each piece addresses problems that, though far from the safe confines of Photoville, are very real. In the photo gallery “Dual Shadows,” visual journalist Jake Naughton follows members of East Africa’s LGBTQ community as they try to escape persecution in their home countries. One subject, Javan, is a 19-year-old transgender woman from Uganda who fled to Kenya to escape abuse, but decided to return to Uganda to set an example. A portrait of Javan reveals a woman clearly exhausted by the oppression brought on her by her country who, despite her suffering, remains defiantly elegant and strong. What makes Javan’s story so dynamic is the contribution of Naughton’s photographs; they include screenshots of death threats via text message, gatherings of other refugees fleeing their countries, and more moments that contribute to the harrowing journeys of people who seem to be a world away but are brought closer through the photographs.</p><p>In “China Through Chinese Eyes,” photographers capture the fighting spirit of China’s people in the face of their country’s social, cultural, and economic struggles. A photo by Guo Xianzhong shows a mother trying to calm her son as he suffers from having accidentally taken one of many illegal vaccines released in China over the years. Another photo shows a young man crying of homesickness because he was barred from travelling back to his home province.</p><p>There are many exhibits with work that documents the refugee crisis, but “Finding Home,” which follows the lives of three Syrian refugee mothers and their newborn babies, is a standout. Photos taken just minutes after the children were born are hung side-by-side with photos of them years later where they remain just as youthful and innocent-looking despite living in environments devastated by war and conflict. Separation of family is intermingled with the joy of a baby’s first steps. In an excerpt from a documentary on refugee families, a mother banters lightly with her husband as they decide what to name their newborn girl. He insists they name their daughter “Heln” instead of “Helen” because it sounds cooler. This light-hearted content is intermingled with reminders of the brutal situations refugees often find themselves in. At the back of the shipping container, in merely 10 square feet, are a thin mattress, some shoes, and a tiny shelf filled with bare necessities. The resemblance to actual refugee conditions in camps brings an onset of fearful apprehension. However, the photos full of childhood innocence and love remind us that hope can be a powerful thing.</p><p>Photoville is more than just a couple of shipping containers pushed together. It’s a place devoted to bringing the kind of content that lies off the beaten path, which usually means subject matter that is not only thought-provoking but challenging to grapple with. One of the first containers visitors see as they walk in is “Charlottesville and Beyond,” a line of portraits of participants at the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally. Among the lineup is a black-and-white photo of Jason Kessler, the organizer of “Unite the Right.” It’s not work that promotes white supremacy or a Nazi mindset; instead, it’s a documentation of history that should not be repeated. None of the photos put the ralliers in a positive or negative light. Beneath each of the portraits is a simple label with the subject’s name, what they do, and who took the photo. Viewers are left to interpret the photos on their own, and because little information is given, are forced to think of the ralliers as actual humans worth hearing out.</p><p>Photoville boasts such a large visitorship because it’s always looking to promote thought-provoking content. In many containers, signs are posted warning viewers about violent and graphic images. There is no such thing as family-friendly in a world where blood, sweat, and tears are common occurrences. Photoville strives to present work that doesn’t only follow mainstream media but brings attention to what isn’t deemed “newsworthy.” It alerts viewers to a fast-paced world that needs attention, and the documentation of its history to prevent worse things from happening.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:00:25.357567	4	1	
184	﻿Artistic Appropriation on Wall Street: The Fearless Girl and Charging Bull	artistic-appropriation-on-wall-street-the-fearless-girl-and-charging-bull	<p>The “Charging Bull” appeared underneath a Christmas tree in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a gift to the city on the morning of December 15, 1989. This statue represented the largest and most famous work of Sicilian sculptor Arturo Di Modica.</p><p>Then, on the day before International Women’s Day of this year, the “Fearless Girl” appeared directly across from the Bull on the same stretch of Bowling Green. Immediately after it was unveiled, it received almost unanimous praise as an inspiration for women everywhere, signifying that they can achieve anything, in the face of every obstacle. However, there is at least one person who is not happy with the statue, and that is Arturo Di Modica.</p><p>Di Modica takes no issue with the intrinsic message of the statue, but he claims that it vilifies his own work. When Di Modica began work on the bull in 1987, Wall Street was just recovering from a crash the year before. He intended for the statue to symbolize the resilience of the American people and to be an ode to their strong work ethic. This message is amplified by the fact that in finance, a “bull market” is a market that is showing growth. Being in the heart of the financial district, its meaning was even more pronounced. Despite some of the connections requiring specialized knowledge, Di Modica wanted the bull to be something all could rally behind, regardless of their background.</p><p>With the addition of the “Fearless Girl,” the message of Di Modica’s work is radically changed. The “Fearless Girl” is daring, defiant, and, well, fearless. Her chin is up, despite the wind blowing against her dress, and she stares ahead with a confident gaze, unfazed by the challenges ahead. With the way the statues are positioned, the challenge she is unfazed by is Di Modica’s bull, which is charging right toward her. Economic growth and the resilience of the American spirit are not challenges for a little girl. On the contrary, these things are good and can help both women and men. Therefore, the bull’s challenge to the girl must represent something else, which means that the original meaning of Di Modica’s work has been changed.</p><p>Bulls are male cows and are often a sign of masculinity; they are aggressive, large, and virulent. Though it was not his intention, Di Modica’s work does lend itself to this interpretation. The bull’s muscles are rippling, its eyebrows are furrowed, and its nostrils are flared. Weighing over three and a half tons and reaching 18 feet, the bull is truly massive. Finally, as anyone who has viewed the bull surely knows, the bull was sculpted in an anatomically correct manner; that is to say, it has a penis and, as it is anatomically correct for bulls, quite large testicles. This turns Di Modica’s work into the perfect symbol of not only masculinity, but dangerous, rampant masculinity (as a charging bull is very dangerous). Now the bull is the obstacle the “Fearless Girl” must, and will, overcome.</p><p>While this makes for a charming narrative and a brilliant symbol for feminists, it is truly unfair to Di Modica. This is not what he intended his work to mean, and it is not what he wanted to see it relegated to. However, legally, the situation is difficult. The “Fearless Girl” is not physically altering the “Charging Bull,” and Mayor Bill De Blasio extended its permit through April of 2018. Yet, it is impossible to say that the “Charging Girl” has not altered the meaning of Di Modica’s work.</p><p>Ideally, the “Fearless Girl” would be beside the “Charging Bull” and looking in the same direction in which the bull charges. That way, the bull could retain its original meaning of American economic resilience, and the “Fearless Girl” would retain its message of female empowerment (but in the context of working with the bull, not against it). In fact, this furthers the intention of the investment firm that commissioned it, as they were promoting not only general female empowerment, but also gender equality in the field of finance. Of course, this solution has its own set of problems; if the “Fearless Girl” was simply moved besides the “Charging Bull,” it would block pedestrian flow, but it does seem to be the best solution, where everyone gets what they want (including the public, with two great works of art).</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:38:15.153606	4	1	Through the placement of “Fearless Girl,” “Charging Bull” is transformed into a symbol that goes against its artist’s intentions.
186	﻿The Rhombicosidodecahedron	the-rhombicosidodecahedron	<p>Final projects have been assigned by drafting teachers who are determined to torment their students. However, when drafting teacher Christopher Suter told his students the guidelines of the final project, he did not expect one of his failing students to design one of the most ingenious toys ever created: the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron.</p><p>“Needless to say, it was […] interesting,” Suter described. He declined to comment further, as he was busy fidgeting with the rhombicosidodecahedron.</p><p>Junior Michelle Yang’s fidget rhombicosidodecahedron is a masterpiece, with over 60 different gadgets designed to make pre-calc somewhat palatable. Yang has created an enormous black market by selling the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron in the girls’ bathrooms for $1.00. Within a day, Yang earned $50,000—not quite enough for a year of college tuition.</p><p>Some of the components of the toy include: a ball bearing to roll around, a pen clicker to click pointlessly, and a flat face that does absolutely nothing, but it feels nice, so there’s that. The rhombicosidodecahedron has an ingenious and ergonomic design and fits right in the palm of your hand, similar to a slightly small grapefruit.</p><p>Yet, with 420 faces, the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron has several unique features. For one, it has a portable printer. However, when someone tried to use it to print an entire textbook, printer functionality had to be disabled until further notice.</p><p>Another feature in progress has been the nuclear warhead side. Though testing is still required, a certain individual named Jim Kong-Dos has expressed interest. To our understanding, the U.S. government has deemed Stuyvesant a sufficiently depopulated area to conduct nuclear testing.</p><p>“I don’t know what possessed me to create the rhombicosidodecahedron,” said Yang in an e-mail interview. She failed to show up to school—in fact, she used the hologram feature of the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron to go to school for her. “For the first time since that multiplication worksheet back in third grade, I actually started working on the rhombicosidodecahedron the moment I got home. It felt like I was procrastinating on my other homework, but I’ve decided to put off caring.”</p><p>Regardless of what it was, the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron was obviously a success. Yang received an A for the class, and apparently, many of the purchasers of the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron have as well. Many teachers blame the “exam cheating” feature of the cube, but it’s obviously just the amazing de-stressing power of the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron.</p><p>Yang’s design for the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron shall be forwarded to the Fidget Company™, where production will begin immediately. The fidget rhombicosidodecahedron will be available in stores beginning August 2017, at the price of $599.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:38:56.980486	5	1	Drafting student designs fidget rhombicosidodecahedron as final project, then sells it and becomes a billionaire.

When the excuses start to run out, can you bear telling the truth—that you tried to fit 12 hours into half an hour—to your teachers? Of course not. So, here’s a list of excuses that you can give them instead.</p><p>MTA-related:</p><p>* “There was a giraffe on the train, and I had an allergic reaction to it.”</p><p>* “The 2/3 line was delayed, which made the 4/5 delayed, which made the H/X delayed, which delayed me.”</p><p>* “Someone was performing, and they kicked me in the depressor labii inferioris. I had to get medical attention.”</p><p>* “I dropped my math notes on the train track, and I spent about half an hour calculating the probability of death if I tried to get them. I eventually figured that it wasn’t worth it so I went home and rewrote them.”</p><p>* “An anti-vaxxer was on the train, so I couldn’t get on.”</p><p>* “A fat man decided to sit next to me and fall asleep on me on the train, and I wasn’t strong enough to push him off, so I could only get off when he did, which was the last stop.”</p><p>Weather-related:</p><p>* “There was too much sun, and as an overworked teenager, my skin is only accustomed to darkness.”</p><p>* “The temperature was below 80 degrees, and it was too cold. I have no fat since I haven’t eaten a meal since the first day of freshman year.”</p><p>* “It was very cloudy today and I don’t trust clouds since water is clear but clouds are white. I waited until the sun came out.”</p><p>Miscellaneous:</p><p>* “My printer ate my homework. It bit my hand when I tried to grab it.”</p><p>* “I tried running this morning before class. My head said yes, but everywhere else said no.”</p><p>* “To test g = 9.8 m/s2, I threw myself down the stairs and injured my right hand. I couldn’t swipe my MetroCard because it hurt so much and it took three hours to find someone who would help me.”</p><p>* “I thought my noisy alarm clock was my band class noodling, so I thought I was at school already.”</p><p>* “My parents emptied my entire bookbag because it was messy—I didn’t take notes anyway. I didn’t realize it until I got to the train station and refused to leave without my precious empty notebooks.”</p><p>* “If you round to the nearest hour, I got here on time.”</p><p>And finally, the most effective one:</p><p>The truth. Tell them why you were really late. Maybe you overslept because you spent all night studying for a test. Maybe you forgot to turn on your alarm. Maybe the trains were actually delayed. Teachers are not heartless; they’ve gone through school just like you. They’ll understand if you’re tired or your legs were sore so you couldn’t make it down the stairs in time. Instead of lying, why not just own up to it and make sure it doesn’t happen again?</p><p>Just kidding, don't do that—they’ll roast you. Please value your dignity.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:40:18.279902	5	1	Excuses that explain why you were late to class.

With a second-round playoff loss still on their mind from last year, this game was one of revenge for the Renegades.</p><p>With great defense all around, timely hitting, and a strong performance by senior and co-captain Frankie Michielli (7 innings, one earned run), the Renegades won 3-2, staving off a comeback attempt by the Warriors to close the gap from 3-1 in the top of the seventh. “We made a lot of great plays in crucial situations today and hopefully we can continue to do that tomorrow against an even tougher team,” junior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl said.</p><p>The victory was a well-balanced one: the Renegades were able to manufacture runs and hold off the Warriors’s attempts to score, as Curtis only scored two runs despite 11 baserunners.</p><p>The damage started with a run scored by sophomore Ruby Gary in the bottom of the third on a wild pitch. As strong pitching and defense kept the Warriors at bay, the final two runs came off a two-RBI triple by Ruhl, which ended up being the difference in the tight affair.</p><p>The Renegades, who started off the season strong on offense, had since cooled off, only scoring 27 runs in their final four games of the regular season compared to 71 runs in the four games before those. “To start the season, most starters were making good contact, and we were having many double-digit-hit games. The offense has been doing well but not as strong as [it was] early on,” coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>Earlier in the season, the Renegades struggled with fielding. Their only other loss this season—against The Beacon School (7-6)—was a result of the errors made, with eight of the 12 runs allowed being unearned. The games against Manhattan Center were a frustrating reversion to the team’s earlier ways. “They are definitely a [defeatable] team, but unfortunately, the number of errors we had caused it to be really hard for us to have a comeback,” sophomore Ally Archer said.</p><p>Consistent fielding is something the Renegades must focus on if they hope to continue their run in the playoffs, and they were able to display that on Tuesday against Curtis. With fourth-seeded High School of Construction on the horizon, the Renegades have a big obstacle in their path to the championship. However, they certainly aren’t letting that stand in their way as they prepare. “[High School of] Construction is going to be the toughest opponent we will face all season, but if we play the way we've been playing I’m confident we can win,” Ruhl said.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:46:44.813448	24	1	
396	﻿Choking on Coal	choking-on-coal	<p>Every morning before dawn, a line of trucks begins to form outside of a city. Stretching for miles on a two-lane road, these trucks inch ever so slowly into a brown haze that obscures everything around for miles. This is the reality every day in Linfen, a city in central China. Once known as “the Modern Fruit and Flower Town,” Linfen has been transformed from a city of natural beauty to one of the most polluted cities in the world over a few short decades due to excessive coal mining.</p><p>The United States and the rest of the world are turning their focus to the Asia-Pacific region as it quickly becomes the home of the most dynamic economies in the world. President Donald Trump himself recently returned from a 12-day trip to Asia. Instead of focusing on renewable energy, Trump appealed to world leaders to invest in the American fossil fuel sectors to push exports all over the world. But in countries like Indonesia and China, this shift back to fossil fuels comes at a great risk to populations which have been devastated by the environmental impacts of oil and coal.</p><p>Examples of this backwards slide include Vietnam, which announced it is reverting to coal production after failed ventures into renewable energies. Japan, too, is moving ahead with plans to close down all of its nuclear reactors and replace them with coal plants. But to examine how the United States can have an impact on this, it is critical to consider why countries are choosing to shift back to fossil fuels. In Japan, the choice comes down to whether or not they should spend $36 billion on United States solar technology, or build cheaper coal plants. When Trump and Congress choose coal over subsidizing the growing renewable energy industry, they drive up the cost of renewable energy around the world, and the people of Japan and Vietnam suffer because of it.</p><p>Under the Trump administration, several factors look to benefit the coal industry greatly. With his dismantlement of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP), which invests U.S. money in renewable energy, Trump is also stripping away the environmental restrictions, enabling coal production to ramp up in the United States. Though the repealing of the Clean Power Plan will marginally restore coal’s place in the United States, this action will do more harm to the environment than economic good. That’s because a strong coal industry damages the health of thousands of Americans, while providing economic benefit to almost no one.</p><p>The CPP, had it been preserved, would have prevented 1,500 to 3,600 premature deaths per year among Americans, according to the EPA. Now, lives are being held at risk over the the Trump administration’s agenda to skirt a reported $33 billion in cost of coal regulations. Furthermore, the U.S. Energy and Information Agency predicts coal will only regain one percent of its lost market share with the repeal of the CPP, underscoring the waste of such an action.</p><p>But the biggest issue with the Trump administration’s shift back to coal is the actual oversight of the industry. With the repeal of Obama-era regulations and subsequent government oversight, the coal industry is ripe for environmental and human catastrophes. Putting aside the many mine accidents and health risks associated with coal miners in recent years, focusing on restoring coal leaves miners unprepared for a changing economy. The principal concern for Trump should be employment for Americans in general, irrespective of the industry. Since 1990, renewable energy has seen over 1200% growth in size as it produces larger and larger shares of consumed energy. Investing in coal mining leaves coal miners overlooked for critical job training as the renewable energy sector inevitably takes over, giving them an ultimatum on their employment.</p><p>Though it is the poster child for pollution, China is not the only country which suffers from the harms of fossil fuel use. In America, cities such as Los Angeles are routinely choked with smog, causing thousands of premature deaths every year. And with Trump now at the helm of the world’s largest economy, slowly but surely the world is beginning to slide back towards the waiting embrace of the coal industry, with great damage to people both here in America, and abroad.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:44:55.411807	2018-01-23 02:44:55.541556	2	1	The Trump administration’s shift to coal is dangerous both to public health and the environment, not to mention bad for the country economically
299	﻿Academic Dishonesty: An Inherent Issue?	academic-dishonesty-an-inherent-issue	<p>Academic dishonesty is a term often thrown around at Stuyvesant, and yet the definition is sometimes unclear. Stuyvesant has garnered an unfortunate reputation for it in recent years, largely based on the well-publicized 2012 Regents cheating scandal. Yet, many find the cheating environment at Stuyvesant to be normal or even expected of such an academically rigorous environment. Students, teachers, and administrators have vastly different opinions on what academic dishonesty entails, and when, if ever, it is even acceptable. An Academic Dishonesty Policy is distributed to students in the beginning of each school year, yet many students have no idea what the policy is.</p><p>The Spectator conducted an online survey, as well as interviews with various members of the Stuyvesant community, to explore the idea of academic dishonesty, and why and how it occurs at our school. 329 students responded to the survey. Here are the results:</p><p><b>Have you ever committed academic dishonesty?</b></p><p>Yes: 83.3%<br>No: 9.7%<br>I’m not sure: 7%</p><p>While at least half of the students in every grade bracket say they have committed academic dishonesty, it is most prevalent in those with a GPA ranging from 85-89, followed by a GPA ranging from 80-84. Academic dishonesty is least common among those with a GPA of 98 or higher.</p><p>Academic dishonesty is nearly equally prevalent between genders: 86 percent of male respondents and 80 percent of female respondents have cheated in some way.</p><p>It is most common in the junior class, where 97 percent of respondents have cheated. Junior year is often considered the most stressful and important year in terms of grades by students, which may explain the high number. Meanwhile, 56 percent of freshman respondents have committed academic dishonesty in their first four months at Stuyvesant.</p><p><b>On a scale of 1 to 5, how frequently do you think you cheat in comparison to the rest of the student body? (1=I never cheat, 5=I cheat much more often than most people I know)</b></p><p>1: 13.4%<br>2: 42.2%<br>3: 29.2%<br>4: 10.6%<br>5: 4.6%</p><p><b>Can you define academic dishonesty?</b></p><p>“Completing any assignment with work other than that completed completely by you. Academic dishonesty ranges from not paying attention in lab and scribbling down your partner’s answers to pulling out your phone during a test.”</p><p>“Academic dishonesty in my view is a more self-centered view than that described by the school. In my mind, letting someone copy off my answers on a test is fine. I would slide my paper into their view and that would be that. For me, it is not considered cheating. I am not gaining anything out of sharing answers. I do not gain unfair advantages by letting someone copy off my answers, thus I do not feel guilty at all. The converse of that situation, however, is cheating. If I do not know the answer and someone shares it to me, I consider that cheating as you are using information you would not have known. You are only academically dishonest if you are lying to yourself.”</p><p>“Any action meant to give a student or group of students an unfair advantage in any school assignment.”</p><p>“Using or sharing outside information (whether it be another student, the Internet, or even yourself) without citing and/or saying it's your own work.”</p><p><b>Have you ever cheated on a test? (Copied off someone, knew the answers beforehand, etc.)</b></p><p>Yes, more than once: 58.4%<br>Yes, once: 12.8%<br>Never: 28.9%</p><p><b>Have you ever copied someone else's homework for credit?</b></p><p>Yes, more than once: 72.6%<br>Yes, once: 10%<br>No: 17.3%</p><p><b>Do you consider copying homework cheating?</b></p><p>Yes: 48.6%<br>No: 51.4%</p><p><b>What subjects are you most likely to cheat on? <i>Responders were allowed to pick more than one choice.</i></b></p><p>Science: 66% <br>Math: 42.6%<br>English: 16.1% <br>Social Studies: 40.1%<br>Drafting: 12.8% <br>Computer Science: 31.3% <br>Others (such as art and music appreciation): 26.1%<br>Language: 41.6%</p><p><b>Do you think the existence of the academic dishonesty contract has any impact on your decision to cheat?</b></p><p>Yes: 16.1%<br>No: 83.9%</p><p><b>Have any of your teachers taken measures to prevent cheating? </b></p><p>Yes: 76.1% <br>No: 7.5%<br>I’m not sure: 16.5%</p><p><b>Do you agree with the Stuyvesant administration's approach to cheating? </b></p><p>Yes: 29.2% <br>No: 25.7% <br>I'm not sure: 45.1%</p><p><b>Have you ever cheated on a standardized test such as the SHSAT, SAT, or ACT? </b></p><p>Yes: 9.4% <br>No: 90.6%</p><p><b>Have you ever cheated on the Regents? </b></p><p>Yes: 14.3% <br>No: 80.9% <br>No, I am a freshman: 4.9%</p><p><b>If you have committed academic dishonesty, do you feel guilty about it? </b></p><p>Yes, a lot: 8.8% <br>Yes, a little: 39.1% <br>No: 52.2%</p><p><b>Have you ever been caught cheating?</b></p><p>Yes: 10% <br>No: 79.6% <br>I have never cheated: 10.3%</p><p><b>If so, what was your punishment, if any?</b></p><p>“I let someone copy my homework during class and our teacher called the AP on us, who let us go with a warning.”</p><p>“Someone cheated off of me once. Teacher caught them, told me to cover my paper, and didn't do anything else.”</p><p>“Caught copying a homework; counted as a 0, phone call home.”</p><p>“0 on the assignment, academic dishonesty hearing.”</p><p><b>Has your opinion towards cheating changed since you got to Stuyvesant? </b></p><p>Yes, I have a more positive view towards cheating: 36.8% <br>Yes, I have a more negative view towards cheating: 15.2% <br>No: 48%</p><p><b>Would you say there is a cheating problem at Stuyvesant? </b></p><p>Yes: 57.4%<br>No: 42.6%</p><p><b>Do you think cheating is justifiable, ever? </b></p><p>Yes: 71.4%<br>No: 28.6%</p><p><b>Why or why not? </b></p><p>“Some teachers are very unreasonable when it comes to homework and tests, so it is expected that students won't try if they aren't taught material. Sometimes, we are burdened with a lot of work and can't study for a test or do homework. It shouldn't be a regular thing, but it's okay. Teachers can't expect us to be reasonable when they are unreasonable.”</p><p>“At Stuy, there’s so much pressure to perform, and there comes a point where you just can’t get a 95 on your fifth test that week. That’s what drives me to cheat. Same with homework. When you’re five hours into homework and haven’t even started the essay due tomorrow, you think, I guess I can ask my friend for the math answers.”</p><p>“Stuyvesant puts you in a situation where doing extraordinarily well isn't possible without sacrificing something.”</p><p>“We all are just helping each other out. Stuyvesant breeds a culture of cheating, and you’re honestly stupid to not take advantage of it.”</p><p>“The only reason we justify and do cheat is because the system we're in pressures us to care about grades and numbers, and not about our actual level of academic achievement.”</p><p>“Although I disagree with cheating on tests, I view cheating on homework assignments as justifiable. Many homework assignments are tedious and meaningless. Although some classes legitimately benefit from homework, some teachers assign homework for the sake of it, even if there is nothing to be gained from it. ”</p><p>“There is no reason to ever cheat. Study for your tests, do your homework. People should only get credit for work they do, so I don't think they should get a higher grade because they successfully cheated on a test compared to those who studied, but may have still got some questions wrong.”</p><p>“There is no honor in cheating. If anyone justifies Stuyvesant's atmosphere as the cause of their cheating, they don't deserve to even go here.”</p><p>“At the end of the day, cheating is still cheating, it should not be justifiable ever, period.”</p><p><b>Anything else you would like to say?</b></p><p>“There are many ambiguous territories within academic dishonesty—for instance, the first bullet point within Stuyvesant's own policy prohibits "presenting the ideas of others (either by paraphrasing or direct quotation) without credit to the source." I took APCS, and am currently taking another post-AP CS elective, and a big part of getting through assignments is simply googling how to use certain functions or understanding why you are getting an error, and using that code that you see to fix your own work. The very nature of computer science makes it impossible to do substantive work without some form of ‘academic dishonesty.’ Citing these sources would be meaningless, because none of us are ever the ‘first’ to write a particular line of code.”</p><p>"It's not academic dishonesty if you don't get caught."</p><p>“I think that students who cheat routinely will find themselves in serious trouble down the road, but students who cheat occasionally shouldn't feel terribly about it. If that's really the case, that specific grade doesn't define you, and neither does cheating.”</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 22:09:13.148377	1	1	
144	﻿S()  Z()  A()	s-z-a	<p>“Am I warm enough for you?” SZA demands on “Drew Barrymore,” the first single off her debut album “CTRL.”</p><p>SZA’s debut isn’t really a debut. SZA (pronounced “sizuh”) is the stage-name of New Jersey singer-songwriter Solana Rowe, who is the first female artist to sign with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Since acquiring her deal in 2013, SZA has released “Z,” an EP, in 2014, has performed at a variety of festivals (the most recent being Coachella), and has appeared on albums by Kendrick Lamar, A$AP Ferg, and Rihanna. She even wrote and performed on Rihanna’s “Anti” single “Consideration” and helped to write Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé’s “Feelin’ Myself” in 2014.</p><p>When it comes to her own work, SZA has kept fans in the dark for almost three years since the release of her mixtape in 2014. “Z” blended R&B, gospel, jazz, hip-hop and classic soul music into an ethereal experience. Ominous choruses were delivered over mystical background sounds, creating a sound that was dreamy, SZA’s trademark. This sound was hard to categorize because it was warm and soulful yet dreamy with heavy pop and hip-hop influences. Her distinct sound initially set SZA apart from her musical peers. Features from Chance the Rapper and Kendrick Lamar contrasted with SZA’s light vocals and allowed her to straddle soul and hip-hop. Despite the success of “Z,” “CTRL” has had little pre-album-based releases, and there are still no available links to any streaming services for the album, which was supposed to drop on October 3, 2016. Links to her singles can be found on her Youtube page: SZAVevo.</p><p>The blame for the album delay fell on her record label and SZA even called out label founder Anthony Tiffith on Twitter, saying, “I actually quit. @iamstillpunch can release my album if he ever feels like it. Y’all be blessed.”</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding its release, “CTRL” is a colorful album. SZA’s hard hitting lyrics (“Do you really love me or just want to let me down?”) contrast with her soothing vocals, effortlessly weaving between strong beats. The distinctive warmth in her voice manifests in crisp falsettos and rich low tones but remains fresh and perky. The choruses are harmonious and catchy, resembling soundtracks from ‘90s films.</p><p>Her new sound straddles the line between R&B and pop but is strongly rooted in hip-hop, with hard beats and features from rappers like Travis Scott as well as SZA’s own bars. Since her last album, she has honed her vocal range and demonstrates her virtuosity in her ballads like “TwoAM,” a sensual but pessimistic cover of PARTYNEXTDOOR’s “Come and See Me,” where SZA sings “From this point on trust nobody outside my body.”</p><p>SZA underwent more than just a vocal evolution in the making of “CTRL.” “I’ve been working on me,” SZA says in an interview with Vogue. “[This] subsequently affects the album. Music, or the type of music that I’m writing, is very personal. Music is my form of cleansing and introspection, so I have to grow in order to accomplish it.”</p><p>Littered with ‘90s references she grew up on, “CTRL” offers a glimpse into SZA herself. The first track “Drew Barrymore,” named after the actress Drew Barrymore, reflects her more mainstream pop sound while also delving into her own insecurities and romantic failings, with lyrics like “I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth.”</p><p>Her lyrics touch on more raw, usually romantic themes, but are more polished while remaining gangsta. Her track “Love Galore” is driven by a strong beat and features a dope verse from Travis Scott, with SZA telling all her romantics interests to “skrt” because she doesn’t need them. “Love Galore” best displays SZA’s ability to be creative with hip-hop by making a love song a fresh, slang-filled club tune.</p><p>SZA’s not-really-debut debut album is complicated in the best way. It reflects SZA herself, raw and vulnerable and and versatile, not to mention immensely talented. Her music appeals to almost all audiences while never compromising her musical integrity.  In the era of New Rap where hip hop fans value creativity more than anything, she stands out by creating a new sound for herself that isn’t quite pop or hip hop, it’s SZA.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:23:37.990287	16	1	A review of SZA’s new album CTRL.
397	﻿Reforming Republicans	reforming-republicans	<p>The result of the 2016 presidential election shook the world. Donald Trump, a businessman with no previous political experience, was elected to the most powerful position on the planet. Trump spent a large portion of his campaign disparaging anyone he viewed as an opponent. The presidency would force him to find a way to unite Americans, even those he had estranged. His largest political challenge would be uniting the Republican establishment, much of which he had alienated, behind his agenda.</p><p>Trump’s victory was meant to herald the start of a new era for the Republican party. Party orthodoxy meant little to the temperamental political novice. He railed against free trade, abandoned traditional political rhetoric, and aggressively attacked Republicans for their perceived inaction on the issue of illegal immigration.</p><p>While Trump was not the ideal presidential candidate, Republicans hoped that his unabashed aggression and their new majority in all three houses of government, which they have not possessed since 1928, would aid the party. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan spoke for many when he said that the conflicts between Trump and the Republican party were “over and done with” and that the party was ready to work with the newly elected president.</p><p>Yet, as the cliché goes, expectations are a far cry from reality. In 2017, the Republican party has floundered. It has flattered to deceive, failing to make good on its promise to reform healthcare, losing a senate seat in Alabama due to its decision to run Roy Moore as a candidate, and finding itself mired in petty scandals and the shadow of the Russia investigation. The attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare was an enormous letdown to the party’s base and a failure of leadership. It was not only poorly planned, but poorly executed, perhaps epitomizing the GOP’s year.</p><p>Attempting to push through legislation, which according to a Quinnipiac University poll had a 20 percent approval rating, was never going to go well. But the way the bill met its fate was even more damaging. The bitter debate that occurred between conservative and moderate Republicans exposed ideological chasms between center and hard right factions within the party. The bill being defeated, brought back, defeated, brought back, and dramatically defeated for the final time was politically detrimental. Politico, Quinnipiac, and the Economist conducted polls in the aftermath which found Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's approval rating in his home state of Kentucky to be as low as 15 percent, significantly lower than the 21 percent it had been at the start of the year.</p><p>An SSRS poll found that fewer than three in 10 Americans hold a favorable view of the Republican party. This number is down 13 percent from March. In fact, this is the lowest number since SSRS polling began in 1992. Even a majority of Republican voters believe that their party leaders in Congress are taking the party in the “wrong direction.” Poor messaging, failed policy proposals, and the scandal-ridden Trump administration have tarnished the Republican party’s image. It is abundantly clear that the Republican party needs to do some serious soul-searching if it is to have a political future.</p><p>The Republican party should start its reform by assessing the strength of its voter base. Despite holding the majority in the House of Representatives, Republicans lost the popular vote. President Trump also lost the popular vote by a far greater margin. Republicans won largely due to gerrymandered districts, and the fact that Democratic voters tend to live in urban areas which Democratic candidates win overwhelmingly, whereas Republican voters are more spread out. But Republicans cannot rely on creative district drawing and convenient demographics if they want to achieve any tangible legislative change. The party needs a new message that can attract alienated voters both within and outside the party.</p><p>An important demographic which Republicans should strive to integrate into the party is the millennial generation. Millennials overwhelmingly back Democratic candidates, with the Pew Research Center finding that over 54 percent of millennials are Democratic. 2016 was the first election in a long time in which Baby Boomers and older generations did not cast the majority of the vote. The millennial vote will only continue to gain importance, as its size and turnout are both projected to increase, and winning elections without millennials will only get more difficult.</p><p>To attract the millennial vote, Republicans need to rebrand their party and present themselves in a new light. Many young voters are drawn to the Democratic party by its proposals concerning economic equality and social welfare. Republicans need to respond by becoming empathetic and presenting themselves as “compassionate conservatives.” They need to show that more government is not the solution to issues such as healthcare. They need to listen to arguments about the ridiculous amount of student debt and overwhelming drug prices. They need to learn to understand the struggles faced by younger American generations and show that they, the Republican party, have the answers. By acknowledging the existence of man-made climate change, working to reduce skyrocketing tuition costs, and presenting more thoughtful anti-poverty policies, Republicans can attract the votes of millennials, poor Americans, and the highly educated, demographics which are currently overwhelmingly Democratic. Rather than molding itself in the model of the overzealous, angry, and blustery Steve Bannon, the Republican party needs to make itself more appealing to these moderate Democrats and Independents.</p><p>The tax plan that was recently passed represents a step in the right direction in terms of enacting policy that directly helps a vast majority of Americans. However, there is still plenty of work to be done if Republicans want to reform the way they are seen by the American public. As the political time bomb that is the 2018 midterms draws nearer, it is imperative that this reform begins now. It's time to change the Grand Old Party.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:45:05.072919	2018-01-23 02:45:05.205762	2	1	Republicans need to learn to understand the struggles faced by younger American generations and show that they have the answers.
18	﻿“Anastasia”: A Stunning Story of Self-Discovery	anastasia-a-stunning-story-of-self-discovery	<p>“Anastasia” opens on a familiar, intimate scene. A young girl with hairbows and a delicate white nightgown sits with her grandmother, who is leaving for Paris. Her grandmother lovingly offers the girl a music box to remember her by. The gentle and much-loved melody “Once Upon A December,” begins to play as snow falls gently around them, sweeping viewers up in a stunning adventure of love, mystery, and self-discovery.</p><p>The adventure follows Anya, a young woman scraping by in revolutionist Russia, who has no memory of the past and is anxious to learn who she is. Anya is convinced by two con men, Dmitry and Vlad, that she is the lost Romanov princess Anastasia because, unknown to her, they need someone to play the part in order to collect a generous reward from Anastasia’s desolate grandmother, the Empress Dowager of France.</p><p>Gleb, a communist officer loyal to the new regime, befriends and cares for Anya while determined to ensure that none of the Romanovs remain alive. Though based off of the 1956 and 1997 films about the princess Anastasia, “Anastasia” the musical is a grown-up, grittier version, combining old favorites and striking new songs to deliver a poignant performance.</p><p>One of the most memorable new additions is a sweetly intimate duet between Anya (Christy Altomare) and Dmitry (Derek Klena) called “In A Crowd Of Thousands.” As Dmitry and Anya attempt to recreate their shared past, the chemistry between them becomes clear as the song turns unexpectedly emotional.</p><p>The reprise of the classic “Journey to the Past,” nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1998, was well done. With her killer vocals, Altomare delivers on the hopeful, passionate solo about Anya’s dreams for the future, serving as a striking Act One Finale.</p><p>The cast of “Anastasia” skillfully depicts engaging characters. Throughout the show, Altomare shines as a frightened but resilient Anya. Her strength lies in portraying Anya as a truly multi-dimensional heroine who fights off a group of drunk men in one scene and dreams of a family in the next. Dmitry is very much her equal—Klena skillfully showcases a gentle side to the cocky and cynical Dmitry.</p><p>Ramin Karimloo aptly plays Gleb, the sympathetic villain, humanizing him through Gleb’s internal conflict. Gleb, ordered to finish what his father started and kill the royal family, grapples with his legacy, his orders, and his burgeoning love for Anya. Through emotional solos such as “The Neva Flows,” Karimloo adds incredible depth to the loyal but kind communist officer.</p><p>John Bolton’s Vlad and Caroline O’Connor’s Lily, the Dowager Empress’s bright and dramatic lady-in-waiting, add some much needed lightness to the story. Their scandalous but sweet affair is full of funny moments—Vlad does squats while they kiss and their secret signal is obvious. Mary Beth Peil is perfect as the long-suffering Empress Dowager. In a setting both magical and undeniably real, the characters are genuine and imperfectly human.</p><p>Visual effects bring Anya’s world to life. A particularly striking moment is the projection of enormous ghost-like figures that twirl across the stage during Anya’s memories of a grand ball, creating a faraway, dream-like feel. Photo-realistic backgrounds pull viewers into the scene during Dmitry’s solo “My Petersburg,” in which he fondly reminisces growing up on the streets. A stunning, sunset-lit St. Petersburg rises gloriously above him and Anya.</p><p>The costumes, done by Linda Cho, tiptoe along the delicate line between historical and modern and reveal the characters’ transformations, particularly Anya’s, without the need for a single word. Dressed initially in a burlap sack-like jacket and a dowdy skirt, Anya is hard to imagine as more than the clumsy, frightened streetsweeper. The moment Anya appears in a stunning, floor-length, deep blue ball gown and white opera gloves, there is something different about her—she is now regal and elegant, perhaps even a princess.</p><p>Though “Anastasia” closely mirrors the 1997 animation, director Darko Tresnjak has strayed from the fantastical plot of the film to convey a darker, more realistic story. He plays with the time period and setting, revolutionist Russia, to add the underlying sinister threat of the Communist regime and the realities of those who live under it.</p><p>Conflicted communist leader Gleb is a new invention, replacing the green, undead wizard Rasputin and his swarm of demons chasing Anya. The complexity of Gleb’s character and loyalties intensify the conflict, abandoning simple concepts of good and bad for murkier waters. Subtle moments such as a gunshot quickly brushed off a truck and song lyrics such as “We stand behind our leaders/We stand in line for bread” quietly reveal the unpleasant truths of Communist Russia.</p><p>“Anastasia” is magical without containing any magic, setting the universal question: “Who am I?” against a dark historical backdrop. In Anya’s journey, we can see ourselves and learn to not be afraid to figure out who we are.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:48:42.192067	18	1	“Anastasia” the musical is a spectacular, grittier take on the story/movie w/ amazing music, awesome plotline, and great actors
15	﻿What “Basic” Really Means	what-basic-really-means	<p>One day during my freshman year, my friends and I had a couple of hours to kill before SING! rehearsal. We took the subway to SoHo, and after 20 minutes of confused zig-zagging through the streets and arguing with both Google Maps and each other, we ran through the door of the popular store Brandy Melville only to find ourselves underwhelmed by the racks of dull, pink t-shirts. We spent about 10 seconds inside, and left shaking our heads and complaining about how basic every clothing item we’d seen was. By “basic,” of course, we meant bland, boring, unoriginal. We also meant mainstream and popular.</p><p>It’s a simple as this—“basic” is an insult intended to shame people for their likes and interests. It’s an accusation that we use to scare and mold each other into someone who we deem acceptable. It’s as if one day, all anyone wanted was to follow current trends and imitate celebrities, and the next, we were living in fear of anything that could prompt our friends and peers to call us basic.</p><p>Maybe it’s time to stop.</p><p>“Basic” is typically used to describe specific elements of arts and culture: restaurants, coffee shops, clothing brands and items, music, movies and television shows, hairstyles, and makeup. But it’s also used as an insult to describe people who like those things.</p><p>It’s easy to ignore the dangerous connotations of the term “basic,” because in most cases, we don’t sound malicious when we use it, but people, especially teenagers, use the term “basic” to pressure and alter each other. We’ve all done it: Retaken a selfie, avoided a brand of makeup, or walked out of a clothing store from an internalized fear of being basic.</p><p>At least, that’s what it’s like if you’re a girl. Basic is typically directed towards conventional feminine clothing and behavior and is often used by girls as a mean accusation to invalidate their female peers. Labelling makeup, popular feminine clothing, and other girl-oriented culture “basic” fuels the old stereotypes that girls are simple, all alike, and not to be taken seriously. So the label has more destructive potential than one might realize without giving it real consideration.</p><p>We all have the power to shape one another. Forcing the “basic” label on each other, targeting girls for having mainstream feminine interests, and using popular culture to shame our peers isn’t the best way to do that. Instead, we should guide each other toward a mix of mainstream and individual interests that complete our identities and help us build confidence, and if that means letting your friends make “basic” choices, let them.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:54:32.137785	28	1	An examination of the term “basic,” how it’s destructive, how it’s productive, how it affects popular culture, and how it can be used to degrade girls.

But where’s the music? Where’s Jay Z?</p><p>This might be what you’re thinking as you watch the short film “Moonlight,” part of a series of new music videos for Jay Z’s most recent album, “4:44.” In them, Jay Z diverges from the usual music video style, doing more than just lip syncing to the song. In fact, Jay Z himself doesn’t appear in a number of them.</p><p>With some creativity and poignant storytelling, each video is memorable in its own way. “4:44” itself is a deeply personal album exploring themes of marriage, infidelity, and race, and the music videos expand on these ideas through the specific images and stories Jay Z chooses to tell.</p><p>In the album, Jay Z exposes a very real, vulnerable side of himself to the public, as Beyoncé had done with the drop of “Lemonade,” and the music videos perpetuate that quality. “Lemonade” made waves by exposing Jay Z’s infidelity and being very public with such a private matter. “4:44” has been hailed as his response to this album, and in it, Jay Z apologizes for his actions, revealing new details such as Beyoncé’s miscarriages and his rough childhood in which he shot his own brother.</p><p>What stands out about the videos is that they could work as stand-alone pieces—not just as supplements to the songs.</p><p>In fact, the video for “Moonlight” only plays part of the actual song, with most of the time being filled by a reenactment of a “Friends” episode with an all black cast and a commentary on diversity in media and cultural appropriation. Suddenly, a phone rings and someone asks, “Hey, can we take five?” The bubble is burst as the camera pans behind the scenes of the set. Ross, played by Jerrod Carmichael, goes offstage and asks his friend, Hannibal Buress, who is watching the filming, what he thinks of the concept. He gets the reply, “Trash.”</p><p>After this comment, Carmichael goes back to filming and becomes distracted, staring off into space. Carmichael tells Buress that he feels what he is doing is subverting mainstream media and making a positive statement, when in reality the concept of a black “Friends” is just imitating Caucasian media, not subverting anything. As the show continues, he is led offstage by Rachel, played by Issa Rae, to a bench. The video ends with Carmichael staring up at the Moonlight.</p><p>Additionally, the song lyrics speak about the infamous accident at the 2017 Oscars when “La La Land” was announced as the Best Film winner, even though Moonlight actually won, saying “We stuck in ‘La La Land,’ even when we win we gon’ lose.” Jay Z is commenting on Caucasian, mainstream media overshadowing the success of African Americans in media. If you look closely at the cover art for the video, typed backward and upside down, it says, “Success is never enough.”</p><p>The most popular music video, “The Story of O.J.,” plays on historical, racist Disney cartoon depictions of African Americans from the mid-20th century. Jay Z also plays on the stereotypes about black culture, including an image of him as a made-up character, Jaybo, eating a large slice of watermelon. He depicts lines of Ku Klux Klan members coming off a factory conveyor belt and even a scene of slaves being auctioned off. These images and the cartoon style reference the country's troubled past and even the present.</p><p>In statements about financial success as an African American, he advises listeners, “You [want to] know what’s more important than throwing away money at a strip club? Credit.” Later, he adds, “Financial freedom [is] my only hope.”</p><p>Despite this advice, the hook of the song seems to send the message that in America, no matter your status, you will still be regarded as the same: “still n***a.”</p><p>Tying together all these small references to America’s past and the plight of African Americans is not unlike Beyoncé’s use of images of black women throughout history in “Lemonade.”</p><p>In “Bam,” Jay Z and his collaborator Damian Marley walk around Trenchtown, Jamaica. Trenchtown is the iconic birthplace of reggae and was home to many of the genre’s most important artists, including Marley’s father, Bob Marley. Marley and Jay Z’s narration cut into the song here and there to drop notes of wisdom about music and the rich history of reggae. In the beginning, Jay Z says, “The prophets in the beginning were musicians, the poets, the writers, and that’s what we’ve been tasked with in this life.”</p><p>As the video plays, it pans to aerial views of the town, kids playing in the streets, mothers and their children, Marley and Hov in the studio, street artists making their own reggae music, and even a feature by Sister Nancy. The artist responsible for the iconic song “Bam Bam” shows up in the studio freestyling a version of the song and speaking to its timeless legacy.</p><p>These intimate moments relate to one theme of the video: people. Jay Z comments, “I feel like when I go to Africa, I’m with my people. I love people. Period.” These shots, transitions or cuts are perfectly timed to the music and beat. The video makes the audience really appreciate small cinematic details, such as when Jay Z says, “We’re all vessels, right? We’re whistles; the wind goes through us and we make the noise,” followed by a shot of trees with the subtle sound of wind rushing through.</p><p>Watching artists of different generations sitting around and discussing their music as it relates to their culture, family, and ancestry conveys a message about the power and importance of music.</p><p>Not the usual flashy music videos, these videos embody a recent trend for artists to take music videos as a real opportunity for compelling, cinematic storytelling. Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE” and Beyoncé’s entire film “Lemonade” are just a few examples in the recent past of the use of a music video as a visual medium not just to accompany a song, but to enhance its meaning and to make its own statement.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:49:17.946914	16	1	Jay Z’s new music video opens on a very familiar set…“Friends”?

21	﻿Hans Zimmer in NYC: A Creative Take on Live Cinematic Orchestra	hans-zimmer-in-nyc-a-creative-take-on-live-cinematic-orchestra	<p>For decades, Hans Zimmer spent most of his time hunched over in a dark, windowless room.</p><p>One of Hollywood’s most prolific and highly esteemed film composers, the Oscar-winning 59-year-old has arranged the iconic soundtracks for some 133 movies—from cinema staples, such as “The Lion King” (1994) and “Rain Man” (1988), to more recent box office hits in the likes of “The Dark Knight” (2008) and “Interstellar” (2014).</p><p>He had consigned himself to the quiet life in studio recording rooms until a conversation with The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr and pop musician Pharrell Williams—both of whom Zimmer had collaborated with—made him think twice.</p><p>“At one point or another, all these musicians [I’ve worked with] said, ‘You have to stop hiding behind a screen. You owe it to an audience to get out on stage and look them in the eye,’” Zimmer said in an interview with the Chicago Sun Times. “I thought, if not now, when?”</p><p>His wildly successful European tour in 2016 prompted an invitation to perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States in April the following year, and this success generated enough demand to launch a North-American leg of his tour.</p><p>Among the final shows on his tour were two phenomenal nights (July 25 and 26) in New York’s Radio City Music Hall.</p><p>The stage was brightly lit and tightly packed—at least 50 musicians of varied nationalities and ages filled their own niche on the risers—with the choir lined across the top level, the orchestra and band in the center, and three full drumsets scattered throughout. The vocalists and soloists, along with Zimmer, were planted at the lowest level.</p><p>Dressed in a purple-tinted vest and plain white shirt with polo shoes, Zimmer took his place at the piano in the center of the stage, smiling brightly. Throughout the night, he rotated among the organ, acoustic and electric guitar, piano, and banjo, often in mid-song, without glancing at a single sheet of music.</p><p>He wasn’t another orchestra conductor in an uptight suit with his back to the audience, but a musician enjoying the camaraderie of a family—he just happened to have written the scores.</p><p>The show opened confidently, with cheerful, crowd-pleasing pieces and all of the instrumentalists of his musical team playing as a mellifluous whole. Seamlessly, the band transitioned into the high-energy Crimson Angels medley. The volume intensified and white strobe lights started flashing, building up to an incredible five-minute, three-man drum solo that shook the walls of Radio City.</p><p>As if the thunderous applause were his cue, Hans Zimmer hopped to the edge of the stage with his arms stretched widely, warmly greeting New York City with his German accent. He kicked off his introductions with accolades for the drummers, drawing another round of applause, and raving about New York’s delicious pizza.</p><p>The crowd went wild with the sudden appearance of Lebohang Morake, the original South African vocalist of the “Lion King” soundtrack, from the right wing of the stage, belting the opening verse to “The Circle of Life.”</p><p>No introductions were necessary; this had been the soundtrack of our childhoods, and Zimmer didn’t miss a beat. He had changed into a simple black t-shirt and hugged the vocalist warmly, joking about how he was much better off singing than ruining cars at the car wash he had been working at before landing the recording gig.</p><p>The “Pirates of the Caribbean” medley, starring electric cellist Tina Guo and violinists Molly Rogers and Leah Zeger, was one of the highlights of the evening. Passion sobered with playfulness radiated from each stroke of their bows. The cellist began with a classical sound and quickly layered the pieces with electronic textures, demonstrating Zimmer’s uncanny knack for integrating the orchestral sound with newer technology.</p><p>Surprises were a common theme in Zimmer’s concert: the night was a glissando of rapid crescendo followed by sudden decrescendo, sharp classical accompanying heavy rock.</p><p>Post-intermission, the legendary Guthrie Govan and Johnny Marr stepped up to the plate with their thumping bass and screeching electric guitar on full blast for the “Wonder Woman” theme, marking the climax of the show.</p><p>The visuals peaked as well: above the stage, the LED screen, which had previously displayed nondescript lines and shapes with simple color schemes, began churning out psychedelic spirals, and the lights, manned by Marc Brickman (Pink Floyd’s famed lighting director), flickered in an almost unbelievably fast lick.</p><p>Not a single movie scene appeared on the screen; in fact, the number of movies Zimmer named could be counted on one hand.</p><p>His goal was not to link the music to the movie, but to the musicians. We always pay more attention to the film than to its soundtrack, and Zimmer flipped the script. He gave his scores legs of their own, and the audience had the freedom to project uniquely personal emotions and memories onto his music.</p><p>Perhaps the most enduring part of Zimmer’s concert was not his music, but his stories. Rambling into several intimate, and often humorous, anecdotes on the quirks of composing for Hollywood, he lowered himself from the pedestal of an ‘untouchable’ deity of film music by making himself relatable.</p><p>Before the ethereal organ sounds of “Interstellar” rounded off the set list, Hans Zimmer vulnerably shared about “Aurora,” his touching musical tribute to the lives lost in a Colorado movie theater shooting during a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.”</p><p>“I had one word: devastated. And all day, I was thinking about the victims and how a word is just not enough...[“Aurora” is] a piece of music that uses no words, but it should feel as if we’re stretching our arms out, and we’re reaching across the Atlantic and embracing the loved ones left behind,” he said.</p><p>We had done nothing but listen and applaud in our seats all evening, but Zimmer made us feel like we were an essential part of something meaningful.</p><p>“When all is said and done and we’ve filled the highest high rises and we’ve built the fastest machines, there’s still going to be room for somebody to tell you a story or somebody to write you a piece of music,” he once said.</p><p>Hans Zimmer bid goodnight to New York and left the stage, only to reappear to a roaring audience for the encore: “Inception.”</p><p>The final piece of the evening was played on a dark stage, reminiscent of the studio room that Hans Zimmer had briefly left behind in order to perform. With a single spotlight on him, the film composer sat alone at the piano for the heartbreaking final chords of “Time”—the only moment he played without the rest of his band and orchestra.</p><p>He high-fived every single person on stage, dramatically air-high-fived the audience, then disappeared into the dark shadows backstage before the applause had even ended.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:49:50.498245	18	1	Zimmer’s live performance covered so much ground, so well—not only temporally (with scores spanning decades of his life’s work) but also artistically (with practically every musical genre given its own time in the spotlight).

These new customers have been described as young teenagers, aged 13-14, with large JanSport backpacks, anime character profile pictures on Facebook, and an obsession with the online video game and salt mine “League of Legends.” They can be found in the sixth floor library, asking upperclassmen for the Wi-Fi password, or in the stairways making their way to the newly constructed 12th floor pool. They are the Stuyvesant Incoming Class of 2021, and they’re ready to take Stuyvesant by storm.</p><p>These new students come from all over the city and represent dozens of different countries, five different boroughs; they have a shared belief that they will be graduating as valedictorian, getting eight hours of sleep every night, and going to Harvard, while seeing their fellow 800 classmates as giant nerds.</p><p>One such student is freshman Noa Morris. Unlike the thousands of sophomores and upperclassmen at Stuyvesant High School, Morris was legitimately enthusiastic to be featured here in The Spectator.</p><p>Morris was found waiting in line at Terry’s, which she chose as her deli of choice over Gourmet Market, commonly dubbed “Fake Terry’s.” “The last thing I would want is something fake, whether it be a deli, clothing, or friends,” said Morris, while sporting a fake Obey hat and Supreme x Stuyvesant Student Union hoodie licensed solely by Student Union President Tahseen Chowdhury as an attempt to raise funds for his state senate campaign.</p><p>In her free time, Morris actively enjoys using the library computers to browse Reddit and post about what extracurriculars will help her get into college while a struggling junior desperately needs to finish his English paper.

But alas, as I prepare myself for inevitably re-entering those Doors of Doom, Death, and Despair, I must come to terms with our impending separation.</p><p>Allow me to anticipate my onsetting mental breakdown by recounting our time together, so I can proceed to waste what little time I have left wallowing in self-pity and an endless barrage of memes.</p><p>I will admit I cannot remember much about our first week together, as I spent 95 percent of it asleep. The highly concentrated cocktail of stress and crippling depression that I had been consuming over the last 10 months resulted in quite the hangover.</p><p>However, by the time week two rolled around, I began to have a slow recovery. I was invigorated by a rare motivation to make positive life changes, such as finally getting off the couch. Unfortunately, it turns out that exercising feels like hell, so that plan was quickly scrapped.</p><p>I then decided to be productive for once in my life. I spent a solid 35.827 seconds thinking about how I should really start studying for the year ahead. With your love by my side, I confidently ordered a Barron’s book that still sits peacefully undisturbed on my desk and has peeked out my window for a record-breaking three milliseconds.</p><p>Alas, like any relationship, we went through our ups and downs. We had our disagreements, like that time you scorched my face off and I spent a solid week more burnt than Trump’s eyes after the eclipse. Despite it all, my undying devotion to you does not change, and I am again reaching a near-catatonic state at the thought of leaving you.</p><p>Maybe the most heartbreaking aspect of our separation is that it obligates me to face the workload I have been desperately avoiding. It appears that the high temperatures did nothing to  reverse my sluggish, apathetic nature, so I accomplished a grand total of zero tasks over the course of vacation. As a result, as I move into the abusive rebound that is The Fall, I still have to memorize all of the information inside my AP prep books, figure out what this “SAT” thing is (Sweat, Agony, Tears?), purchase an IKEA book shelf which can store my 23 million pages of AP Euro review sheets and 91 Crash Course volumes, adopt and register a bear as a support animal in order to survive junior year, construct a stroller (cage?) for said bear to bring it to school, acquire a piloting license so that I can fly away from my problems, build a time-travel machine so that I can prevent that one time I tripped on stage at my elementary school graduation from happening, write a letter to Dreamworks demanding an explanation as to why Artie wasn’t given more screen time in Shrek the Third, master kung-fu, and become a legendary painter tutored by the one and only Bob Ross (through my time-travel machine, of course).</p><p>Normally, I would blame not getting anything done on my tendency to procrastinate and avoid any sense of responsibility like the Black Death. However, this time around, I am blaming you—I was seduced by your warm beaches and sunny frolic-worthy green fields, forgetting all of my worries. I think you really might be a bad influence.</p><p>Honestly, I’m finding it a little hard to not be bitter about your fear of commitment. I mean, can’t you stay year round? Instead, it feels our time together passed by quicker than Scaramucci’s stay in the White House. But, like all good things, our relationship too is nearing its end. Don’t worry about me; I’ve already planned out coping with our break-up by ugly-crying and consuming alarming quantities of ice cream during the first week of school. So now, I’ll set you free and say good-bye, marking June 26 on my calendar for when I shall see you again.</p><p>Always yours,</p><p>Gaby</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:50:09.855705	5	1	“With your love by my side, I confidently ordered a Barron’s book that still sits peacefully undisturbed on my desk and has peeked out my...

16	﻿Spider-Man: How A High School Setting Brings The Franchise to its Peak	spider-man-how-a-high-school-setting-brings-the-franchise-to-its-peak	<p>Imagine how you’d feel if a high-ranking executive of a well-known corporation, such as Apple, noticed your talent and promised to get in touch with you in the near future. Then, imagine your disappointment if that official were to cut off communication with you altogether.</p><p>If you’ve managed to do this, you have captured the exact feelings of Peter Parker in “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”</p><p>“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” directed by Jon Watts, revolves around Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland), a 15-year-old high school student, trying to prevent Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) from dealing dangerous weapons involving alien technology in order to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger.</p><p>It is hard to imagine how a second reboot of the Spider-Man franchise could stand out from its predecessors in any way. However, in the first “Spider-Man” trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, Peter Parker is depicted as a photographer who had just graduated high school. In “The Amazing Spider-Man” series directed by Marc Webb, Peter Parker is portrayed as a high school student. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” manages to stand out from not just the previous Spider-Man movies, but also movies of the superhero genre, by focusing on Spider-Man as a high school sophomore.</p><p>For example, unlike in the first “Spider-Man” trilogy where Spider-Man is granted the power of organic webbing, in this version, Parker secretly creates his own web fluid in chemistry class and hides it beneath his locker. In addition, when Parker finds out that Vulture is in Maryland thanks to his secretly implanted tracker, he makes a last-minute decision to accompany the decathlon team to its national academic tournament in Washington, D.C. The movie ties in aspects of Parker’s second life with his school life so well that it makes it seem as though Spider-Man cannot exist without his counterpart role as a high school student.</p><p>In “Captain America: Civil War,” Parker is taken out on his first Avengers-related fight by Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, leaving Peter with a thirst for more missions, a theme that “Spider-Man: Homecoming” expands upon. Throughout the film, Parker repeatedly attempts to prove himself to Stark by ending Vulture’s arms trafficking business. His need to show he is more than just someone trying to protect his neighborhood is a reflection of how a majority of teenagers believe they are more than just “children.”</p><p>Many teenagers attempt to make their own life choices in order to be more independent and to show their maturity. Peter is not an exception, making many rash decisions to put his job as a superhero first, stating, “I am so far beyond high school right now.” He quits band, hangs out with his best friend Ned (played by Jacob Batalon) less frequently, refuses to participate in the national academic decathlon tournament with his team before finding out about Vulture’s location, and even skips class—all in order to commit more time to combatting criminals as Spider-Man.</p><p>The most prominent example of this kind of decision-making is in regards to his suit. In order to keep Stark from shutting down his quest to defeat Vulture, Parker disables his suit’s tracking device and shuts down the suit’s “Training Wheels Protocol,” which had previously prevented him from using its more advanced features, such as shooting different kinds of webs and enhancing hearing and sight. Trying to unlock features he was not prepared for at his skill level caused him to be at a constant loss during the action sequence that followed and ultimately lead to Vulture escaping and Parker being stuck in a storage vault.</p><p>However, the reckless mistakes he makes to validate his role as a superhero make his maturing all the more gratifying. After apprehending Vulture, Parker realizes he does not need to be an Avenger in order to be a good superhero. Thus, at the end of the movie, when he turns down Stark’s offer to become a member of the Avengers, Peter truly illustrates how much he has grown. By no longer feeling the need to prove he is capable of fighting crime on a larger scale, Peter overcomes one obstacle on the long road to maturity, creating a satisfying ending.</p><p>One may argue that simply changing the age of a main character cannot possibly affect the quality of a movie to such a large degree; but in this case, changing the age impacts the movie by making it more appealing to its audience.</p><p>The scenario used at the beginning of the article shouldn’t have been too hard to visualize. Many high school students, especially those in competitive schools like Stuyvesant, will go through or have already gone through the struggle of trying to get themselves noticed by high-status officials, whether it be through research papers or project ideas. So when Parker tries to get his efforts and talents noticed by Stark in attempt after attempt, the majority of the audience—who are either high school students or have been in high school—will be able to empathize with Parker, creating a larger emotional payoff for Parker’s eventual success in proving himself.</p><p>“Spider-Man: Homecoming” is vastly different from the preceding films of the franchise. By weaving the experience of a high school student into the storyline of a savior of Queens, it creates its own unique charm and leaves a greater impact on its audience through its relatability.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 00:04:55.322545	13	1	“Spider-Man: Homecoming” stands out from other superhero movies in that its protagonist accurately portrays the character of a high school student.

The 2016 election was meant to be a watershed victory for progressivism and the beginning of a new liberal future for America.</p><p>Instead, Donald Trump rode into power on a wave of discontent as the leader of a conservative resurgence. The election marked the pinnacle of a trend of increasing partisanship and a disturbing aversion to compromise. Since then, every day has been a pitched battle between ideological extremes that has brought our government to a standstill and threatens the stability of our country. While it may be tempting to take your gloves off, it is imperative that we begin the process of reconciliation to forge a bipartisan future for America.</p><p>How did we get here?</p><p>Most of us—regardless of where we stand on the political spectrum—can agree that the last election was complete chaos. Tensions brewed: Clinton ignorantly described Trump’s base as “basket of deplorables,” and Trump called on the “Second Amendment people” to assassinate a potential President Hillary Clinton. This kind of slander should come without surprise, however. Insolence has become the defining character of this era’s political atmosphere. The American public has been caught between partisanship’s superficial entanglements. Both Clinton and Trump were the most unpopular nominations of their respective parties in the modern era, and both parties have shunned the slightest diversity of thought, the slightest divergence from their agendas.</p><p>The entrenched partisanship belies the reality that independents constitute nearly half of Americans. As Democrats have grown increasingly liberal, and Republicans have grown increasingly conservative, independents have become increasingly ostracized from political participation. The party bloc has become the default interface of American politics, where legislation is hammered out in party chambers rather than on the floors of Congress. Discussions no longer involve the actual effects of policy, but rather fixate around vote numbers and the interests of party leaders. With the recent passing of the American Healthcare Act, for example, there was no final score of the bill on the floor of the House; Republicans were nonetheless rallied to vote for it along party lines by House Speaker Paul Ryan.</p><p>Gerrymandering—the redrawing of district boundaries along partisan lines—has, in part, made political extremism expedient. Gerrymandering limits competition by cramming as many opposition voters into small districts as possible. Congressional districts. like North Carolina’s 12th and Maryland’s 3rd, often snake across hundreds of miles in a desperate bid to pack like-minded people together. This safeguards the position of the majority party and artificially polarizes voters by ideology. By isolating the populace into two distinct halves, parties are free to pander to their base and force people to vote for their increasingly extremist and narrow-minded agendas. While it is easy to balk at the policies of the other party, platforms that were sure political suicide a few years ago are now the mainstream.</p><p>Our detachment from one another is exacerbated by the cycle of fear and distrust peddled by politicians and media outlets. While pundits were quick to attack the divisive and incendiary coverage put forth by fringe organizations, like Breitbart, during the election cycle, many mainstream media outlets have also become troublingly political and biased. A Pew Research poll indicates that 74 percent of Americans believe news organizations favor one side of the political spectrum. The clickbait headlines mocking liberals and bashing conservatives have made politics dangerously entertaining and addictive. By spewing information with a partisan slant, the modern media forces us to live in our pre-existing biases. While external factors have tainted our political climate, new ideological rifts have shaken up internal party politics as well.</p><p>The stunning Democratic loss can be attributed to the exclusionary splintering within the party. Bernie Sanders’ campaign electrified young and progressive-minded Democrats and found large support amongst white Rust Belters and independents. Clinton’s nomination disillusioned many of Sanders’ supporters, likely costing the Democrats the critical states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Post-election, the Democratic party has failed to learn from its failure, choosing instead to abandon its status as the “big-tent party,” the evolved descendent of Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition. The new Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Tom Perez has claimed that all Democrats have to be pro-choice, alienating roughly 20 percent of Democrats that are pro-life. Furthermore, the far left has become more and more outspoken, alienating Democrats who do not believe in identity politics.</p><p>The political infighting that led to Trump’s election has also severely hurt Republicans. Recent polls have shown severe dissatisfaction even in the states Trump carried: President Trump polls at 41 approve/51 disapprove in North Carolina, 44 approve/47 disapprove in Wisconsin, 41 approve/47 disapprove in Florida, and—shockingly—42 approve/54 disapprove in the consistently Republican Texas. The “Never Trump” movement never picked up steam as a result of the seventeen candidates running for the nomination. Trump managed to stand out from the carbon-copy playing field, directly demonstrating the power of extremism in swaying voters.</p><p>So, what can we learn?</p><p>Polarization has led to dissension, as near-majorities of Americans find discussing politics with those with opposing political views to be “stressful and frustrating” (Pew Internet Research). Clashing with our ideological foes over Twitter can be exhausting and the thought of retreating to our favorite InfoWars or DailyKos story may seem appealing. It is critical, however, that we take the initiative to step out of our political echo chambers and reach out to one another in order to better understand other opinions and the very causes that we claim to be fighting for.</p><p>To truly advance an agenda and realistically implement our vision for the world, Americans must accept bipartisanship. By distancing ourselves from ideological extremes and embracing centrism—a tolerance of ideas we may not openly support—we can communicate with each other and expand the reach of our goals and outlook. At the same time, moderates cannot be marginalized and coerced into acceding to the whims of an extremist minority. Rather, it is important for moderates to stand steadfastly by the principles of political centrism and by the belief in the superiority of compromise over partisan bickering.</p><p>That being said, the two-party political system has been a longstanding part of American politics since 1789 for good reason—it’s often the simplest way to broadcast opinions and effectuate broad changes. In this way, the two-party system has been working very well in convincing Americans to accept wide-sweeping agendas.</p><p>The Trump presidency serves as a wake-up call to understand these failures of partisanship, however. From this point on, it is important for Democrats and Republicans to truly comprehend the basis of their beliefs in order to form a bipartisan compromise. Staunch Democrats should be questioning their beliefs not to become Trump apologists, but to understand their position to be able to better argue and support it. Staunch Republicans should do the same to be able to offer objective defenses of the Trump administration. In effect, many partisan voters will end up abandoning the longstanding hard-set party lines, better reflecting the reality that political identification is on a wide spectrum and not in two camps.</p><p>Indeed, a multitude of similarities do exist: most Americans support infrastructure developments, education investments, responsible economics, amongst other tenets. Most importantly, Americans share an interest in the betterment of the nation. As President Obama famously quipped, “there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.”</p><p>———————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Timeline</p><p>“A Buildup in Partisanship”</p><p>2009:</p><p>Jan 28: House Democrats passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—an $831 billion stimulus package to rejuvenate the economy after the Great Recession—without a single Republican vote.</p><p>2010:</p><p>Mar 22: After a contentious debate, the House voted 219-212 to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, allowing President Obama to sign healthcare reform, or Obamacare, into law. The legislation failed to gain the support of any House Republicans.</p><p>Oct 23: Senate Minority Leader and Leader of Senate Republicans Mitch McConnell boldly announced his intention for “President Obama to be a one-term president” in an interview with the National Review.</p><p>2013:</p><p>Oct 1: Tensions between President Barack Obama and House Republicans came to a head when negotiations over how to fund the government failed. The funding gap sparked the third-longest government shutdown in American history, shuttering vital services and agencies.</p><p>Nov 21: After the confirmation process of a number of President Obama’s judicial nominees stalled in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the “nuclear option” to end the Republican filibuster. The nominees could now be confirmed without any Republican support.</p><p>2016:</p><p>Feb 23: Hours after the death of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Senate Republicans announced that they would not hold confirmation hearings for a replacement judge until after the upcoming election. Although President Obama nominated the moderate Judge Merrick Garland, Republicans refused to hold a vote, creating the longest vacancy in the history of the court.</p><p>Nov 8: Donald Trump wins 306 electoral votes to become the 45th president, but would lose the popular vote by three million votes. Far from the claimed “landslide victory,” Trump would instead face questions about the legitimacy of his victory.</p><p>2017:</p><p>Jan 20: Newly sworn-in President Trump’s Inaugural Address would reiterate campaign commitments to “end the American carnage,” invoking an unusually troubled and partisan tone.</p><p>Jan 21: The Women’s March movement would become the largest single-day protest in America, strongly protesting the presidency with the slogan “Not My President.” Some critics pointed out, however, that pro-life organizations were excluded from the event on the basis of their beliefs.</p><p>Feb 8: Trump unveils his entire cabinet, which included controversial picks such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. These nominees were largely confirmed along partisan lines.</p><p>Apr 7: Neil Gorsuch was confirmed to the Supreme Court after Republicans invoked the “nuclear option” on the Senate floor, shutting down the Democratic filibuster against Gorsuch’s nomination.</p><p>May 4: The Republican-sponsored bill to overhaul Obamacare narrowly passed in the House 217-213. This bill faced bipartisan challenges in its uncompromising stances on rolling back all provisions of Obamacare, such as protecting pre-existing conditions or expanding Medicaid eligibility.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:18:31.817641	2	1	
145	﻿See Ya, School!: A Stuyvesant Student’s Guide to Summer Cinematics	see-ya-school-a-stuyvesant-student-s-guide-to-summer-cinematics	<p>The past school year has been a particularly difficult one, especially considering the additional stress of a billionaire Cheeto being elected President of the United States. However, this summer, Stuyvesant students can take a breather from the stress of school with some of this year’s most anticipated movies, ranging from action-packed hero blockbusters to potential Oscar-worthy notables by some of Hollywood’s most renowned directors.</p><p>To all students seeking another reason to welcome the start of summer, here are six movies everyone should be on the lookout for to keep you refreshed during the upcoming break.</p><p>“Wonder Woman” (June 2, 2017)</p><p>DC fans are already migrating to the cinemas this month with the release of “Wonder Woman,” a brand-new film centering around everyone’s favorite Amazon heroine. Gal Gadotmade a stunning appearance in “Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice” as Wonder Woman, and now she finally earns the spotlight in this early summer release. When war pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), USS Enterprise captain of this generation’s “Star Trek” films, crash lands on Themyscira, Wonder Woman’s home island, he tells her of the conflict going on outside her island’s borders. Skilled, mature, and ready to become the hero the world needs, Diana of the Amazons leaves her island and travels to assist the outside world in resolving this massive conflict. Those who buy tickets will watch as Diana, sword and whip in hand, cements her name in history and earns the title of Wonder Woman—always ready to lead and prepared for war.</p><p>“Baby Driver” (June 28, 2017)</p><p>Get ready for the ride of your life with this upcoming release directed by Edgar Wright.  Known for his unconventional and brilliant movie ideas, Wright, director of the Cornetto Trilogy, has brought to the big screens another pinnacle of entertainment, a movie about a young man named Baby (Ansel Elgort), who at the start of the movie is making a living driving a getaway car for a group of thieves. Baby is a genius driver, able to maneuver between two trucks with one turn of his wheel and drive just as good backward as he can forward. For this reason, he is the only driver who Doc (Kevin Spacey), Baby’s boss, is willing to use for his criminal activities. When a new love enters his life, Baby needs to decide whether he’ll keep his distance before she’s put in danger, or if he’ll go out and face the music, cutting himself loose from Doc’s grip on him and his talents. With an A-list cast including Jamie Foxx from “Ray” and Jon Hamm from “Mad Men,” watch Baby take to the wheels and rev up for the drive of his life.</p><p>“Despicable Me 3” (June 30, 2017)</p><p>Despite the Minions being an extremely overused, and frankly annoying, advertising tactic, the third installment in the “Despicable Me” animated comedy series actually seems amusing with a few interesting new characters. Despite former supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) becoming a devoted husband and father and a crime-fighting secret agent over the course of the previous two “Despicable Me” movies, he is temporarily swayed back to the villainous side with the introduction of his wealthy long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Steve Carell). Dru wishes for Gru’s help with one last heist: stealing a jewel from the latest flashy villain who looks as if he’s been pulled straight out of the ‘80s, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). With Dru’s more positive attitude and incompetence contrasting heavily with Gru’s very serious nature, the new brotherly rivalry may add a fresh and humorous dynamic to the film.</p><p>“Spider-Man: Homecoming” (July 7, 2017)</p><p>This summer, Tom Holland suits up yet again as the boy genius from Queens with a spider bite that has given him powers beyond his imagination. After the events of “Captain America: Civil War,” Peter Parker is stuck back in his normal life as an NYC high schooler (we all know how boring that can get), when a new bad guy (Michael Keaton) comes to town, ready to crush the one people call “Spider-Man” by any means necessary. If you go to watch this film, one cool thing to keep in mind is that Tom Holland took it upon himself to do his own stunts for the movie. Also, composer Michael Giacchino has changed the original iconic Spider Man score, giving it a refreshing modern twist.</p><p>“Dunkirk” (July 21, 2017)</p><p>Operation Dynamo, the Allies’ successful evacuation mission in Dunkirk, France, from May 26 to June 4, 1940, was wrought with thousands of casualties. Christopher Nolan’s World War II film sheds some light on this historic tragedy. It depicts the desperation of thousands of Allied troops on land, at sea, and in the air struggling to endure constant attack from the Nazis. Some especially evocative scenes shown in trailers include dozens of soldiers on a ship bracing for an explosion and troops respecting the deaths of their fellow fallen, letting them drift off to sea. The film is a massive project with an impressive cast, including “Star Wars” actor Tom Hardy and former One Direction member Harry Styles. Furthermore, with Nolan opting for genuine battleships and historic locations over the usual Hollywood CGI effects, “Dunkirk” is bound to be hauntingly realistic.</p><p>“Atomic Blonde” (July 28, 2017)</p><p>Who said women couldn’t be kickass undercover spies? This thriller film, based on the graphic novel “The Coldest City,” by Antony Johnston, takes place toward the end of the Cold War, very close to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron), a MI6 spy, with the reluctant help of pugnacious Berlin station chief David Percival (James McAvoy), is sent to Berlin to identify and take out an espionage ring that has killed another MI6 agent. Scenes from the film depict Theron’s character as a ruthless, skillful woman. She displays her incredible martial arts prowess by beating up big, burly men and shooting agents in slow motion while still staying stylish in her stiletto heels. In addition, as shown by a sex scene involving her and another woman, Lorraine is not only one of the few female spies in media, but also one of the first LGBTQ+ spies. With a fitting ‘80s soundtrack and fantastic usages of dim and bright neon lighting, “Atomic Blonde” looks to be a spy film on par with a “James Bond” movie.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:25:25.425988	4	1	This summer will feature the release of many incredible movies as a refreshing break from the past school year.

148	﻿The Video Game Changer	the-video-game-changer	<p>It was pouring rain—the kind of day where you just want to pull the covers over your head and play video games. So I was surprised to see hundreds of people actually leave their console to show up at the first ever Tribeca video games festival.</p><p>Billed as a “festival within a festival,” the legendary Tribeca Film Festival launched a games fest for the first time ever.</p><p>Some may consider video games the most fun thing in his or her repetitive, mundane life, while others may think they are an addictive waste of time. Either way, the intellectuals and artists who run the Tribeca Film Festival think that video games are the latest and greatest art form.</p><p>While the term “video game festival” evokes a bunch of nerds gawking at new games and consoles, this video games festival was far from what you may have envisioned.</p><p>Just one hour was devoted to the actual playing of video games, and many were unknown titles that have yet to be released. The lines were so long that most people didn’t even get a chance to play.</p><p>The focus of the festival, rather, is the process of creating games from an intellectual standpoint—an opportunity to see into the brain of game creators, game writers, and game directors—and find out what inspired them.</p><p>The giant conference room was actually a large sound stage used for filming movies and commercials in Soho. They put a thousand folding chairs in and a portable stage with some indoor palm trees, converting into a functional space for an eager video game audience.</p><p>They were not too many teens. It was mostly people in their 20s and 30s who must have been very, very serious about video games as a new emerging kind of interactive film. After all, they gave up a perfectly good Saturday to see the legends of game creation lecture.</p><p>There was a cappuccino bar with free nutella crepes where everybody, especially people dressed in hip, black film director outfits, could opine about videos. You could tell I was the only high school student because I was the only one stuffing the free nutella candy bars into my pockets.</p><p>One fellow named Michael Swayner of Brooklyn and his posse of two guys were dressed as if they were attending a networking event for artsy professionals. I asked them why they made time in their schedule to purchase some pricey tickets for the event, and they told me that they thought it was time that video games got the respect they deserved.</p><p>I asked Michael what his favorite game was and he said that it was family time around Super Mario when he was a kid. His siblings were very competitive and the fun they had trying to outdo each other is the gaming adventure that mattered the most. This wasn’t a response that reflected the supposed serious nature of video game creation that he had come to the festival to experience. However, it was a response that I could relate to.</p><p>Another guy named Juan, from Queens and in his early college years, told us that video games were most important for their magic stress-reducing properties. He said you should start playing because you forget your troubles for a while. He also felt it was a world he could control when he was younger—the only thing he felt he had some control over back then.</p><p>We all rushed into the stage area to take our seats for the biggest draw of the festival.</p><p>Hideo Kojima is the creator of “Metal Gear” and “Silent Hill,” games that changed the industry since they were the first to use live actors instead of 3D models. This gave all games a much more realistic feel. When he took the stage, the audience members leapt to their feet with a standing ovation. I was excited to see him in person. He talked to the crowd through an interpreter about how his childhood was marked by the mandatory viewing of films: his parents refused to let him go to bed until he had screened several a day.</p><p>Kojima also told us that he was allowed to take a bus from his village to the city when he was only three years old to see a movie while his parents were at work. That fueled a lifelong obsession with films.</p><p>By his teen years, Kojima said he was binging on films like “Taxi Driver,” watching them seven times each, for a different creative focus each time. It soon became clear that he would do whatever it takes to become a film director. And he told the crowd that he was particularly obsessed with Robert DeNiro. Deniro founded the Tribeca Film Festival, which is why Kojima agreed to fly in all the way from Tokyo.</p><p>We have the high cost of film production to thank for Kojima’s transformation into video game design. He couldn’t afford to make a two-hour film, so he used his ideas, complete with film actors, to create games.</p><p>That made him the very first game designer to use actors as the models for game characters. As he gained more success, he started using famous actors in the games.</p><p>Kojima also had the vision to turn the industry from games like “pong” to games with powerful and complex storylines, Metal Gear being an early example.</p><p>The audience asked a lot of questions about this, particularly about why he spent big money on actor Kiefer Sutherland instead of using 3D models.</p><p>Kojima said that actors bring their own interpretation to a role, thereby adding an extra layer of creativity and realism—something he just couldn’t get from a 3D model.</p><p>The audience was heavily into the corporate politics of game creation, and the huge news in this world was Kojima’s acrimonious split after 30 years with game company Konami, after much turmoil between him and the organization. This became a big deal around the world because Kojima kept winning awards but was not allowed to go up to the podium and accept them—Konami was portrayed as a group of corporate bad guys. Fans and gaming companies joined in the protest against Konami.</p><p>Some members of the audience told me that they were annoyed to see that this was not addressed on the podium—I learned later that the legal resolution required Kojima to keep his mouth shut regarding those events.</p><p>Kojima finally broke away from that oppressive work situation and he will be releasing his first ever game created by his new indie gaming design group. He toyed with us by saying that he will now reveal something about the new game.</p><p>But all he’d say was: it will have characters and a plot. The audience laughed at the ongoing secrecy. We are all rooting for him and hope the game smashes records and crushes Konami.</p><p>The second big panel, which drove the crowd back from the free snack area and into their seats, featured Ken Levine, writer and director of BioShock, a first-person shooter series set in an underwater dystopia.</p><p>He was paired with action movie director Doug Limon for a compare-and-contrast discussion of movie-making with game creation. Limon is the producer and director of “Edge of Tomorrow” and the “Bourne Identity” franchise. It was exciting to see giants of their perspective industries paired together to talk about the differences in game creation and movie-making.</p><p>Levine told the crowd that the main difference between game creation and movie-making is the lack of glamour.</p><p>Levine said that after a star-studded premiere, everyone kisses up to the director. But for a game writer, the end of the production process is only heralded by a bunch of bloggers going online and making fun of your new game.</p><p>Limon countered that screening a film at a premiere with an unhappy star is no picnic. Angelina Jolie, he said, was so unhappy with footage from a scene of “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” that she burst into tears while sitting next to him.</p><p>As we left the festival, Michael Swayner felt that “it’s time that gaming got more respect as an art form.” He followed up by saying this should be so “because everyone who plays video games is part of the creation process.”</p><p>Our ability to participate and manipulate the storyline of a video game is, indeed, a game changer for the industry that our generation has shaped. And if it really morphs into an enhanced art form of interactive films, we will all have had a hand—not to mention a thumb—in that transformation.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 21:01:55.645251	4	1	
274	﻿Independence, Patriotism, and Deep Sea Fishing Rights	independence-patriotism-and-deep-sea-fishing-rights	<p>The year is 1776, and the Second Continental Congress has convened in a courtroom in hot, sticky Philadelphia. The Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)’s 2017 fall musical, “1776,” directed by juniors Kareena Singh and Bo Xuan Wu and freshman Clara Yuste, opens to an exhausted, overworked congress slumped over at tables, swatting flies, and wiping the sweat off of their foreheads. It is a setting that is frequently returned to throughout the narrative of the show, which revolves around the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p>To anyone familiar with American history, the facts are simple: numerous delegates from the original 13 colonies assembled in Pennsylvania and debated briefly before signing the document that shaped our political legacy by asserting our independence from Great Britain. What “1776” attempts to do is give emotional meaning to that distant event, capturing the rivalries and stories of the people involved in it.</p><p>STC’s rendition of the show told this story through an energetic, polished, and wonderfully jovial performance. Every scene was blocked or choreographed thoughtfully, from the kickline in “The Lees of Old Virginia” that always managed to kick John Adams (junior Adam Elsayed) in the face to the seating arrangement in congressional debate scenes that could best be described as organized clutter.</p><p>The set was adorned with carefully crafted historical pieces—the wallpaper, tables, and chairs had an antique element to them, and a detailed painting of the Liberty Bell hung in front of a background of treetops and rolling hills. However, several aspects of the set made no sense, like the wooden column protruding from the center of the backdrop for no apparent reason and the windows floating in midair with no beams or walls to support them.</p><p>A most impressive element of the show was the quality of the music. The band, directed by senior Aidan Amog, junior Jason Kim, and sophomores Cosmo Coen and Sara Stebbins, played with an unparalleled level of professionalism, capturing every musical phrase in a way that adeptly underscored the show’s storyline. From the fanfare prelude to the final bows, the band’s energy consistently carried the show.</p><p>The ensemble numbers were also strong and musically immaculate, and of the singing roles, each voice had something distinctly wonderful to bring to the table. Elsayed’s rich, carrying voice nailed several of the show’s most pivotal moments, like when Adams sat alone and reflected on the possibility of giving up everything he worked for due to a clause in the Declaration that Southern states were unwilling to accept. Adams was also beautifully complemented by the softer vocals of his wife, Abigail Adams (sophomore Zeynep Bromberg), in their numerous duets.</p><p>One standout number was “He Plays the Violin,” Martha Jefferson’s (freshman Mimi Gillies) ode to her husband’s many talents. Gillies’s honey-like voice blossomed at the song’s high notes, resonating through the theater as she blissfully waltzed with an imaginary partner.</p><p>The climax and arguably most enthralling part of the show was when Edward Rutledge (senior Alex Whittington) stood up in front of the Second Continental Congress and belted “Molasses to Rum,” an impassioned anthem in support of slavery. In this electric performance, Whittington’s powerful tenor belt caused the ground to nearly shake, and he used the song’s choreography to convey the exhilarating rush Rutledge gets when recounting his experiences as a slave owner. Through sharp, calculated movements, Whittington depicted Rutledge as simultaneously graceful and maniacal—a brilliant, spine-chilling portrayal.</p><p>There were several shining moments between actors. The character dynamic between John and Abigail Adams unfolded through carefully blocked duets that mimicked their separation and detailed the famous letters they wrote each other. As Abigail crooned to her husband, “Don’t stop writing. It’s all I have,” the bittersweetness of their love was palpable.</p><p>Moreover, energetic, animated background acting and hilarious one-liners like Joseph Hewes’s (Clara Yuste) "Mr. Jefferson, nowhere do you mention deep sea fishing rights. We in North Carolina—" kept the show entertaining and humorous and gave life and dimension to the story. In order for any theatrical piece with a large cast to be brought to life, the actors need to work as an ensemble to paint a three-dimensional, overarching picture, and STC nailed this crucial aspect of the show.</p><p>Through songs, meaningful choreography, and adept historical interpretation, STC effectively conveyed the triumphant story behind the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. It is particularly exciting that much of it is underclassman talent new to the STC spotlight, setting the stage for many phenomenal performances in the years to come.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-03 20:30:45.619531	21	1	
295	﻿What’s In a “reputation”?	what-s-in-a-reputation	<p>For months, the world saw little of Taylor Swift. Turns out, it’s because the “‘old Taylor is dead,” as Swift herself declares in “Look What You Made Me Do,” the lead single of her newest album. Taylor Swift’s sixth album, “reputation,” was released November 10, 2017 amid great anticipation and controversy, and Swift has taken care to present it as a clean break between her old persona and her new image.</p><p>From the start, Swift tries to distinguish herself and her album’s new style as unlike anything she’s ever done before. “… Ready For It,” the album’s first song, is dark and fast-paced; Swift’s tone is aggressive and much more reminiscent of rap than her former country-style crooning. The static and deep bass create a white noise effect underlying Swift’s singing that reflects a heavier sound than she’s put out before. It serves as a warning shot that this new Taylor Swift is nothing like the gentle America’s sweetheart that fans have grown used to.</p><p>And yet, as the song reaches the chorus, Swift’s voice reverts back into the familiar high-pitched, soft quality that marked her previous work. In fact, it’s almost impossible to not be reminded of “Wildest Dreams,” Swift’s single from her 2014 album, “1989.” Within the first minute, “reputation” established the inescapable question posed by the album and by Taylor Swift as an evolving artist: is the old Taylor really dead?</p><p>Perhaps dead is an over-exaggeration. Swift’s collaboration with rapper Future and singer Ed Sheeran in “End Game” of the same album makes for a unique song and an interesting blend of musical styles, but Swift’s key characteristics prevail. In her verse, Swift sings, “And I can’t let you go, your hand prints on my soul / It’s like your eyes are liquor, it’s like your body is gold,” continuing to display lyrical talent and a specific eloquence and romanticism when describing a lover that she has long been associated with.</p><p>At the same time, the song seesaws between brimming with confidence, as Swift loudly mocks her “big reputation,” and what appears to be vulnerability, as Swift expresses, “I don’t wanna be / Just another ex-love / You don’t wanna see.” Ultimately, her direct declaration of her expectations in the relationship—to be the “end game”—unveils a new depth and a change in Taylor, who seems to be taking increased control in her own fate, breaking from the helplessness of her former self.</p><p>This shift in Swift’s approach to relationships is consistent throughout the album. For the first time, Swift is secure rather than miserable. “Call It What You Want To” embodies this message: Taylor can be content and happy in her relationships without having to define them to anyone. In singing, “My baby’s … high above the whole scene / Loves me like I’m brand new,” Swift truly establishes a new Taylor, one that won’t be subject to manipulation, and a new sort of love, one that is steadfast and real.</p><p>It is refreshing to see Swift finally embrace her sexuality. “Dress” is breathy and unmistakably suggestive. Swift is blunt like never before as she croons, “Only bought this dress so you could take it off.” Perhaps it does harken back to the old Taylor in its sense of want and (as Swift herself says) “pining and desperately waiting,” but it does so in a way that is new and different because Swift is making the choice to be vulnerable. Whereas before Swift might have been defenseless when it came to love, she now intentionally lets her guard down.</p><p>Furthermore, it is shocking to see Swift directly referencing sex or, as she does later in the song, drinking. These more mature elements shield “reputation” from the naivety that blanketed the old Taylor; she has, invariably, grown up. Carnal themes have always been excluded from Taylor Swift’s image, which centered around her innocence. By finally incorporating them, Swift acknowledges that her image has inevitably changed as she herself has evolved into a grown woman.</p><p>Swift is defiantly unapologetic, evident in “I Did Something Bad” where Swift loudly declares, “They said I did something bad, / Then why’s it feel so good? … And I’d do it over and over and over again if I could.” Behind her singing, the drums are explosive, a feeling which pervades throughout the song and evokes the sense of a person being pushed past the edge. Swift finally indicates her own guilt, a stark contrast to her previous role as a victim. Her lack of remorse is a strong rejection of her role as “the good guy.” By combining her fiery lyrics with the song’s forte, Swift effectively creates the feeling of intense liberation.</p><p>Swift also poses a direct challenge to her accusers as she sings, “They’re burning all of the witches even if you aren’t one / So light me up… go ahead and light me up.” In doing so, Swift becomes a much more empowered and fearless figure; she fully embraces her bad press, freed from having to preserve her reputation.</p><p>Musically, “reputation” is dramatically distinct from Swift’s previous work. “Don’t Blame Me” is a dark, soulful sermon enveloped in Gothic undertones. The percussion sounds like a heartbeat, while Swift’s deeper, drawled voice that sounds less like singing than it does talking sounds like a confession. The slow, powerful tempo matched with declarations such as, “And baby for you / I would fall from grace / Just to touch your face,” reveal a side of Swift that is raw and heartfelt.</p><p>Meanwhile, Swift’s voice seems to be endlessly flexible. In “Delicate,” her hushed tones and sweet singing are magnetic and sensuous. The electronic influences are expertly employed, with Swift’s voice taking on a robotic sound distinguished by its wavering quality. The inhuman, electric sound provides a beautiful juxtaposition with the delicate tone of Swift’s natural singing, resulting in a surprising contrast. It’s a bold presentation of Swift’s musical genius.</p><p>Curiously, the album’s closing song, “New Year’s Day,” is written and sung in a very classic Taylor Swift style. It is gentle, slow, and one of the few occasions where Swift retains an aura of innocence. The minimalist piano tones in the background allow Swift’s ultimately optimistic message to pervade; despite all of the turbulence of her previous romantic endeavors, she intends to stay with the person who’s willing to do the same. Thus, Swift ends her revolutionary album with an old-fashioned acknowledgement of her growth beyond the romantic notions of midnights and preference for the steadiness of someone who helps clean up the mess in the morning.</p><p>Certainly, “reputation” is a heavy album. Its sound is a melting pot of classic Taylor styles and new, darker, uncharted musical territories. Despite Swift’s insinuations that her image is always what she has carefully crafted, she is nevertheless sincere and open within her music as she always has been. I cannot say that I believe there is a new and old Taylor. More likely, there is just Taylor Swift, an artist and media sensation and human who grows and evolves while her music follows suit.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 18:06:23.98073	16	1	A review of “reputation” and an exploration of what it means for Taylor Swift as an artist.

I always believed students would find this class very fulfilling and entertaining, as it pertains to reality and brings a touch of delight to their dull cellphone-less lives,” he said.</p><p>The results of the survey were attributed to Health teacher Barbara Garber and her intellectually stimulating baby project, which requires her students to carry around a baby doll. “I let my kids get creative with the babies’ names,” Barber said. “But instead of names of drugs like ‘Marijuana,’ which I thought they would choose, I get sweet names like ‘Mary’ and ‘Jane.’Stuyvesant students are such sweet angels.”</p><p>Students have been so attached to this project that many have continued carrying their babies around even after the project was over, calling on administration to install baby playpens in every classroom. “My baby needs a place to be! I couldn’t possibly leave it on the cold hard surface of my desk. What if it falls down and has a concussion?” junior Joseph Lee said.</p><p>Due to popular request, administration has been considering adding a health elective or making health a two-semester course led by Garber, going into details about quadruplet caretaking techniques and advanced hands-free male breastfeeding techniques. “I can’t imagine not having health in my schedule. It’s basically the only reason I come to school now! If I can’t take this class anymore, I think I’m just gonna stay home to take care of my baby,” junior Peter Jin said.</p><p>Garber is also excited about what these changes to the health department could mean. “I no longer need to preach abstinence, since everyone knows how to care for a baby anyway,” she said.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 22:37:06.264898	5	1	Health class reaches record popularity at Stuyvesant, as revealed through a survey, and it’s because of health teacher Ms. Garber.
309	﻿Communist Revolution Inspires Hostile Takeover of Stuyvesant	communist-revolution-inspires-hostile-takeover-of-stuyvesant	<p>With five essays, a project explaining why people who don’t study French can’t pronounce the word “croissant” properly, and a reading of the “The Communist Manifesto” due on the same day, sophomore Steve Wang finally reached his breaking point. After intense hours of thinking to no fruition, he finally picked up his copy of the “The Communist Manifesto.”</p><p>But once Wang picked it up, it was love at first sight. He even taught himself German to read Marx’s original. He was ready to start a new revolution.</p><p>The following day, Wang gathered as many people as he could to his locker and gave one of the greatest speeches in recorded history.</p><p>“I was in tears,” recalled sophomore Javed Jokhai with tears streaming down his eyes. “He was so passionate throughout the entire thing. His speech rapidly reached a pinnacle:</p><p>“‘The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of the teachers! We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of the administration in half, even if it takes an eternity! With your support, we will send the hammer of the students’ will crashing through the windows of this house of servitude! Let the faculty tremble at a student revolution. The pupils have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors of all GPAs unite!’”</p><p>“It’s not even like he shamelessly plagiarized a Squidward speech and ‘The Communist Manifesto’—it was based off of pure originality,” he said.</p><p>Soon after the speech was given, Wang and his followers took to the halls, armed with sharpened pencils and notebooks and toting a giant banner that boldly read, “Seize the Means of Education” in red lettering.</p><p>Eventually, students from all classes started to join in his march. As more teachers were stripped of their titles, students reportedly started to discard their textbooks outside of classroom windows, replacing them with more copies of “The Communist Manifesto” while Wang dictated the following speech:</p><p>“No longer will we be dictated by the teachings of our former masters! We have been oppressed by our teachers—students have suffered for far too long under this regime where scholars keep getting curved up by the grades of the working students! But—no more shall we be exploited by this grading system. Nay, in place of the old system, with its AP classes and electives, we will have 11 free periods a day!”</p><p>After all of the faculty were overthrown, Wang decided that his work was done. Little did he know, it was a dark time when it was every person for himself or herself; without teachers, students ran amok throughout the halls. Eventually, this led to factions. One of the largest of these factions was being led by sophomore Adrian Dickson, who rallied in support of the old grading system.</p><p>Sensing the imminent threat of Dickson, Wang began to rally again. Being forced to fight against Dickson’s contacts from Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech as well, Wang and his few supporters managed to cough up a miracle; with only old stress balls and gym shorts at their disposal, they managed to win against the advancing army.</p><p>However, his victory was short-lived. After hearing the news of their son’s radical thinking, Wang’s parents immediately came to school and pulled him out by the ear, shouting threats along the way. Though resistant at first, he quickly complied to their demands after they threatened to burn his Karl Marx plush toy and proletariat action figures.</p><p>At the cost of future communist revolutions, the assigned “The Communist Manifesto” reading has since been revoked as well. To fill the void in the curriculum, teachers are now showing documentaries on communism that will surely make any revolutionary fall asleep.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 22:46:30.789197	5	1	A Stuyvesant sophomore decides to start a revolution and overthrows the entire school’s administration.
17	﻿Yaa Gyasi Explores Lineage in “Homegoing”	yaa-gyasi-explores-lineage-in-homegoing	<p>I have always told myself that I will never attempt to research my family history. For me, the daunting task of unwinding and accepting what I might find on Ancestry.com seems too painful or too frustrating to even attempt. Half of my family comes from Korea, the other from Haiti. While my Korean grandparents are relatively sure of their lineage for generations, my Haitian lineage is far less certain.</p><p>My dad tells me my grandfather was a mélange truly representative of the makeup of most people of Caribbean descent. My grandmother, he says, is likely almost entirely of West African descent. However, other than stories, vague accounts of relatives, and faded photographs, I have no record of my ancestors, who they were, what they did, when and whether they were slaves, and when or whether they engaged in the slave trade.</p><p>In her debut novel “Homegoing,” author Yaa Gyasi, a 26-year-old Stanford graduate born in Ghana and raised in Alabama, explores this complex skein of lineage and history with slavery that all descendants of Africa’s Gold and Ivory coast carry with them.</p><p>While slavery’s complicated legacy is ever present in the Americas, evident both in our culture and through the oppression and inequality that still exist today, often overlooked in the U.S. is the legacy of slavery in Africa’s Gold Coast. Gyasi’s panoramic work intertwines and juxtaposes these two histories and cultures in an attempt to codify the long-lasting effects of the slave trade for both those who were captured and sold and those who stayed behind.</p><p>A tremendous undertaking, “Homegoing” follows seven generations of descendants of two ethnically Akan half-sisters in what is now Ghana. Born in the mid-18th century, they are unaware of each other’s existence. Effia, married to a white official and cursed by a fire on the night of her birth that, like slavery, “burned, up and through, unconcerned with the wreckage it left behind,” lives a life of general comfort in Cape Coast Castle, oblivious to the horrors occurring in the dungeons beneath her feet.</p><p>Her half sister Esi is captured and held in the dungeons of the same castle with “so many other bodies…that they all had to lie, stomach down, so that women can be stacked on top of them” and is referred to as “cargo” by Effia’s husband. Raped by an unnamed white man, Esi is inspected, packaged, and shipped across the Atlantic.</p><p>The story of their progeny takes the shape of vignettes, with the story of each generation occupying a single chapter, linked into a cohesive and compelling narrative by both familial ties and motifs.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most moving and heartbreakingly human chapters comes from Gyasi’s description of slavery through Esi’s daughter, Ness. Ness, who endures the hauntingly grotesque horrors of slavery, is stolen from her mother and estranged from her roots and language as her mother is given “five lashes for every Twi word Ness spoke” while growing up. Her strength is evident as she carries the weight of scars “shaped like a man hugging her from behind with his arms hanging around her neck.”</p><p>This narrative of American slavery is heightened and expanded by its imprint on Effia’s descendants. It strips identity from Quey, her son, a slaver whose light skin and broken Twi lead children to ask if he’s a white man. It returns humanity to James, her grandson, who marries a woman who refuses to shake his hand because he belongs to an ethnic group known to be slavers. James muses, “If the girl could not shake his hand, then surely she could not touch her own,” because “everyone is a part of this. Asante, Fante, Ga. British, Dutch, and American.”</p><p>Dialogue like this between chapters is what lends the novel both breadth and depth. Gyasi continuously ponders the meaning of fire and water, hashing and rehashing the weight they carry throughout generations. Fires in the night reappear in permutations to haunt descendants generations later: in the nightmares of a great-great-granddaughter for whom fire represents the trauma passed down through generations on the face of her son and in the fears of his children. A young man fears the water that once brought his ancestors over the Atlantic.</p><p>Water and Fire, two stones, one passed down through generations, one lost after the first, represent the lineages we remember and those we lose through apathy or strife. Names gain meaning as children for generations only know their parents by name. Gyasi depends heavily on symbols and motifs such as these to give structure to the massiveness of her work.</p><p>Of course, the format of interconnected short story-like glimpses into generations has drawbacks. Each chapter needs an exposition, a cast of characters to populate it, and inevitably, some characters are more convincing than others. Especially through Esi’s descendants in America, it is clear Gyasi bites off a little more than she can chew as she attempts to codify the African American experience from slavery to Jim Crow, to the great migration, to the Harlem renaissance, to the modern day. While these characters have sparkling moments of humanity and depth, they sometimes come across as conglomerations of the black experience of the time: important, but lacking depth or direction.</p><p>H, for instance, arrested for nothing and forced to work in a mine, is a dimensionless manifestation of state-sanctioned slavery after abolition. Willie, a gospel singer who moves North during the Great Migration, and her husband, who abandons her after realizing he can pass as white, are little more than tropes attempting to capture the black experience of their time period. Their son, a heroin addict in the ‘60s is an expansion of a remark made earlier in the book by James, lamenting that slavery will never end because the oppressors “would just trade one type of shackle for another, trade physical ones that wrapped around wrists and ankles for invisible ones that wrapped around the mind.”</p><p>Gyasi’s narrative prowess truly shines through the winding trajectory of Effia’s descendants in Ghana. The freedom from an archetypal storyline gives way to an at times joyful, quirky, and overwhelmingly human story. Episodes of surprising vibrancy reveal life in characters, from a kneeling mother reunited with her son who knows she is crying “by the wetness of his feet” to a housekeeper whose smile, once she realizes she can speak her native language with her employer, allows him to see “into her throat, her gut, the home of her very soul.”</p><p>Gyasi’s prose is by no means breathtaking, but as she embarks on this epic endeavor, these moments of humanity and startling clarity are the ones that stand out. A stunning debut novel, “Homegoing” is confirmation that Gyasi has much to say as well as room to grow and add depth to her prose.</p><p>“Homegoing” is a grand and painful push both forward and back. It is the struggle toward a home that may not even exist and the exploration of the roots and history that have been forcibly excised. Gyasi records and unpacks the power of truth, generational trauma, and most of all, lineage. Just as with a family, one chapter, one story, cannot exist when not surrounded by others, each supporting and engaging in dialogue with the rest.</p><p>As the Akan proverb preluding her novel states,</p><p>“The family is like the forest: if you are outside it is dense; if you are inside you see that                each tree has its own position.”</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2018-01-14 00:47:09.386345	15	1	A review of “Homegoing” by Yaa Gyasi.
26	Peglegs Lace Up for Upcoming Season	peglegs-lace-up-for-upcoming-season	<p>The end of summer means the beginning of a new season for Stuyvesant’s boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs. Each year, boys from all grades attend tryouts in the hopes of earning a spot on the coveted team, which competes in the PSAL Manhattan A1 division.</p><p>At the end of last year’s soccer season, the Peglegs were ranked third in their division, with a record of eight wins to four losses. The team was the 21st seed in the playoffs, and the Peglegs played their first playoff game against the 12th seed, Staten Island Tech (SIT). Unfortunately, their playoff run was ended by a 4-0 loss to SIT.</p><p>Though the team lost six important seniors this year, it still has a strong starting lineup, composed of many returning players alongside some younger faces. “I've played with some of the players for four years now, and I know exactly how to play with them,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said.</p><p>The team has prioritized specific skills for the coming year. “We need to improve on keeping the ball once we get out of our half and our offense in general. We tend to get a bit sloppy in the final third of the field, but I'm confident we can solidify this by the beginning of the season,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzburg said.</p><p>Gillow agreed, reflecting on improvements that can be made from prior years and their playing. “I think the most improvement is needed on offense and possession of the ball in particular,” Gillow said. “In recent years, our offense has struggled at times to score, but I think we've learned as [a] unit what works and what doesn't going forward.”</p><p>The team’s first game this year is against Julia Richman Education Complex (JREC) on September 10. Last year, the team fared well against JREC, winning both of the season meets. The Peglegs have learned from their weaknesses last year, becoming more comfortable as a team and working toward a better playoff outcome.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:50:41.146161	24	1	As school starts up again, the Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, prepare for another strong season.
27	﻿Your Guide to the 2017 NFL Season	your-guide-to-the-2017-nfl-season	<p>There was no chance anyone could beat the Seattle Seahawks in 2014. They were coming off a blowout Super Bowl win and were only getting better with experience. Yet the Patriots knocked them off in Super Bowl XLIV.</p><p>There was no team near the New England Patriots in 2015. Everyone thought they were too good for the rest of the league. Yet the Panthers became the alpha dogs, going 15-1, and the Pats didn’t even make it to the Super Bowl, losing to the eventual champions, the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Then, one year later, the Carolina Panthers were the alpha dogs. Everyone put their money on the top defense led by reigning MVP Cam Newton. Who could stop them?</p><p>Well, it turns out everyone could. They went 6-10 while the Deflategate-hampered Pats blew through the competition on their way to a Super Bowl victory.</p><p>And here we are today: the Pats sit as defending champs and alpha dogs and are overwhelmingly favored to win it all. So before we go on and crown them repeat champions, let’s remember history and consider there’s always someone waiting to knock off the preseason favorite.</p><p>Going into the season, the Patriots added some star players, wide receiver Brandin Cooks and cornerback Stephon Gilmore, so as far as repeats go, things look good. However, they lost running back LeGarrette Blount, and Tom Brady has hit the age of 40, so there are signs of decay in Foxborough. Outside of them in the AFC East, the Dolphins are good, but not great, the Bills aren’t worth talking about, and the Jets would be lucky to win three games.</p><p>The Steelers are an interesting challenger, but their defense is vulnerable, and Belichick knows this team too well to lose to them in the playoffs.</p><p>The Titans are the exciting team in the South; they come off a fringe-playoff season and head into 2017 with a second-place schedule with a young improving quarterback, Marcus Mariota, and a proven running back, DeMarco Murray. Still, this team isn’t developed enough to challenge the Patriots in crunch time.</p><p>Next, we move on to the Raiders in the West (the Chiefs are too conservative, the Chargers are old/hurt, the Broncos are closer to top five pick than a division title), who could have challenged New England last year had quarterback Derek Carr not suffered a season-ending injury before the playoffs. With Marshawn Lynch out of retirement to go to Oakland’s backfield, things are looking up for them.</p><p>With the Colts hampered, the Ravens and Bengals hampered, and a transitioning Broncos offense, the Chiefs should be able to sneak into the playoffs in a Wild Card spot, but they aren’t a real threat to the Patriots.</p><p>In the NFC, the Giants and Cowboys each make a strong case for the top spot in the East. The Giants added some firepower with wide receiver Brandon Marshall, making the trip from the other locker room to join the successful team in New Meadows. Dallas’s young star quarterback, Dak Prescott, has a year more of experience, but the loss of cornerback Brandon Carr and safety Barry Church will hamper their secondary, making it tough for them to repeat their 2016 success. The Giants have the edge in this division.</p><p>Speaking of the Packers, they didn’t get much better. They probably will barely use tight end Martellus Bennett, who they added this offseason, and their defense is still a bit of a mess. But they have arguably the most talented quarterback in history, Aaron Rodgers, so they’ll win their division and contend nonetheless.</p><p>In the South, the Falcons are coming off a surprise breakout season, but now they’ve lost offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, and they still lack defensive talent. The Panthers, on the other hand, drafted running back Christian McCaffrey out of Stanford, and they still possess one of the best defenses in the league, as well as former MVP quarterback Cam Newton. They won’t go 15-1 like they did in 2015, but a bounce back is in order and so is a Super Bowl hangover for Atlanta. Edge goes to Carolina.</p><p>The Seahawks will win the West, but it won’t be pretty behind an unstable offensive line and offensive weapons. The rest of this division is either old or terrible, so even with Seattle’s struggles, this appears to be a safe bet.</p><p>So now things look something like this:</p><p>AFC:</p><p>1. New England Patriots</p><p>2. Oakland Raiders</p><p>3. Pittsburgh Steelers</p><p>4. Tennessee Titans</p><p>5. Miami Dolphins</p><p>6. Kansas City Chiefs</p><p>NFC:</p><p>1. New York Giants</p><p>2. Green Bay Packers</p><p>3. Carolina Panthers</p><p>4. Seattle Seahawks</p><p>5. Dallas Cowboys</p><p>6. Atlanta Falcons</p><p>The Patriots are just better than every team in the AFC by a lot. They’re going to another Super Bowl.</p><p>The NFC will be much more interesting as the Giants are an unintimidating #1 seed, and the conference powerhouse Seahawks fizzle a bit to the #4 seed. The Seahawks versus the Cowboys should make for an interesting first round, but the Seahawks should prevail as the Cowboys lack a strong pass rush and have a very weak secondary, and the Seahawks haven’t lost a home playoff game in the Russell Wilson era (5-0). The Panthers and Falcons will feature no love lost as these two division foes go at it. Carolina should be able to win with home field advantage and a powerful defense that Atlanta will struggle against without Kyle Shanahan on the Falcons’s sideline.</p><p>From that point, I’ll pick against Eli Manning any day (he won’t become elite a third time), especially against a defense that will pressure him a lot and lock down his top targets. Seattle’s offensive line may be spotty, but the Giants’s lack of linebacker talent will allow Russell Wilson to scramble and dump down all day. On the other side of the NFC, Aaron Rodgers should catch fire as usual in the playoffs and blow past both the Panthers and Seahawks, as he’ll be playing in the comfy freezing temperatures of Lambeau Field.</p><p>Then, on to the Super Bowl!</p><p>Brady versus Rodgers is the marquee matchup of a lifetime, and this Super Bowl won’t disappoint. While Rodgers is the superior talent, at the end of the day, the superior roster and personnel will prevail as New England’s weapons on offense, playmakers on defense, and masterminds on the sideline will prove to be too much for Rodgers to carry the team any longer.</p><p>So, remember when I said we shouldn’t just write off everyone else and pick the repeat? This is one of those special cases. The last team to repeat was the Patriots back in the 2004 season, and now Brady and Belichick will do it again, earning their sixth ring and further cementing themselves as the best quarterback and coach of all time.</p><p>Full Predictions:</p><p>Wild Card Round</p><p>Steelers def. Chiefs</p><p>Titans def. Dolphins</p><p>Seahawks def. Cowboys</p><p>Panthers def. Falcons</p><p>Divisional Round</p><p>Patriots def. Titans</p><p>Steelers def. Raiders</p><p>Seahawks def.

28	Mimbas Striking for More	mimbas-striking-for-more	<p>The Stuyvesant girls’ soccer team, the Mimbas, is looking to build off of a successful previous season and make another playoff appearance. Coming off a 6-5 record, a fourth place finish, and a first round playoff elimination, members of the team are still upbeat, believing that a solid core infused with new talent will carry them farther into the postseason than previous years.</p><p>This year will present several new obstacles for the team, such as adjusting to the higher level of competition in their new Manhattan A2 division and replacing the production of their three graduated seniors. Nevertheless, the girls are excited to make a name for themselves in an unfamiliar division. Senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl believes that this new division will bring more adversity, but remains steadfast that the team will adapt and that their skill set will shine.</p><p>Ruhl’s co-captain, senior Saloni Majmudar, agrees. “It’s definitely the most well-rounded and experienced team we’ve had in the past four years,” she said. The team has players in every grade for the first time in recent memory and the talent has allowed for a more competitive environment in practices.</p><p>The loss of the seniors, including second-highest goal scorer on the team Brigit Bacon-Blaber (‘17), will no doubt sting, but both captains believe that their players are ready and are more than capable of stepping up. “Although we lost three seniors, I think the team is even stronger this year,” Ruhl said. Sophomore Selene Kaehny, Stuyvesant’s leading goal-scorer from last year, will hopefully contribute to making the next step.</p><p>Likewise, Majmudar commented that the team will miss the constant positive energy of the seniors. However, the new talent has reassured her that they will have a successful season. They have taken steps to prepare for the new competition during practice and have confidence that the adjustments will bear fruit out on the field.</p><p>“We’ve been working a lot on building cohesion through game-like situations and scrimmages,” Majmudar said.</p><p>The team is planning to scrimmage LaGuardia High School before its first league game, and this will provide a level of competition and experience that cannot be found in practice. “We do a lot of scrimmaging to not only become better players, but to build a better team dynamic,” Ruhl said.</p><p>Team cohesion and the ability to work as a unit will play an important part in how competitive the Mimbas are going to be in a tougher division. Though it will no doubt be an uphill climb, the team is eager to get back on the field and make another run for the playoffs.

The Western Conference became much stronger, while the Eastern Conference suffered. Superstar Chris Paul was traded from the Los Angeles Clippers to the Houston Rockets. Free agent Gordon Hayward decided to sign with the Boston Celtics. The Chicago Bulls traded star Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Oklahoma City Thunder acquired star Paul George. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Celtics swapped starting point guards. The new outlook of many teams after the offseason has dramatically changed the hierarchy of the league.</p><p>WESTERN CONFERENCE</p><p>1. Golden State Warriors</p><p>This offseason, the Warriors proved that the rich just keep getting richer. After beating the Cavaliers in the Finals 4-1, the defending champions enter the 2017-2018 season as heavy favorites to win the Finals again. They maintained their current roster by resigning superstars Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, and capable role players Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. They also added Nick Young and Omri Casspi to bolster their bench behind their loaded starting lineup of Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Durant, and center Zaza Pachulia</p><p>2. Houston Rockets</p><p>The Rockets now have the best backcourt in the league, made up of Chris Paul and 2017 MVP runner-up James Harden. While the rest of their starting lineup may not be full of standout players, the Rockets’ depth at all positions will allow them to challenge the Warriors in the Western Conference.</p><p>3. Oklahoma City Thunder</p><p>MVP winner Russell Westbrook finally found some help after the Thunder traded for all-star Paul George. While the two will be able to bring the Thunder far into the playoffs, they may not be able to handle teams like the Rockets and Warriors because the other players in the lineup are not good enough to help them go farther.</p><p>4. San Antonio Spurs</p><p>Unlike many teams in the Western Conference, the Spurs had a relatively quiet offseason. Their only addition was Rudy Gay, who is coming back from major achilles surgery. This lineup was enough to make the 2016-2017 Western Conference Finals, but the West is now much stronger and this aging roster will have a tough time competing.</p><p>5. Minnesota Timberwolves</p><p>While the Timberwolves were one of the worst teams in the league last year, they are now one of the best. The acquisitions of all-star Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague will help superstar Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins lead the ‘Wolves to the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only is their starting lineup filled with stars, but their bench is solid enough to help the team go deep into the playoffs.</p><p>6. Los Angeles Clippers</p><p>The Clippers traded superstar Chris Paul to the Rockets but acquired Danilo Gallinari from the Denver Nuggets. While losing Paul hurts, Gallinari and the strong frontcourt of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan will lead an otherwise average roster to the playoffs.</p><p>7. Denver Nuggets</p><p>The Nuggets traded Danilo Gallinari to the Clippers this summer, but acquired Paul Millsap through the same trade. The Nuggets also have a strong bench which ranked eighth in points scored last year and will play a large role in their playoff push in a strong Western Conference. Millsap, along with frontcourt partner Nikola Jokic, will lead the Nuggets to the playoffs for the first time in five years.</p><p>8. Portland Trail Blazers</p><p>The Blazers must lean heavily on a backcourt of all-star snub Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, who averaged 50.0 points per game (PPG) together. The Blazers also have a good young center in Jusuf Nurkic, who will help carry a roster of average and below-average players.</p><p>9. New Orleans Pelicans</p><p>After signing Rajon Rondo, the Pelicans finally have a respectable backcourt of Rondo and Jrue Holiday. The Pelicans will pair that backcourt with the best frontcourt in the league of Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, who averaged a combined 55.0 PPG last season. While this team looks good enough to make the playoffs on paper, a lack of chemistry between Davis and Cousins may negatively affect their play on the court.</p><p>10. Memphis Grizzlies</p><p>After losing Zach Randolph and Vince Carter, the Grizzlies have a big hole at the power forward position and scoring off the bench. While they do have great leaders in all-star Marc Gasol and Mike Conley, the Grizzlies will have a hard time making the playoffs in a loaded Western Conference.</p><p>EASTERN CONFERENCE</p><p>1. Cleveland Cavaliers</p><p>After losing to the Warriors in the Finals, the Cavaliers tried to form a roster this offseason that would be able to defeat the Warriors in future matchups. Complicating matters, Kyrie Irving demanded a trade from the team, resulting in the biggest blockbuster of the summer: Irving was traded to the Boston Celtics for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and a 2018 first round draft pick. However, Thomas and superstar LeBron James will still lead the Cavaliers to a fourth straight NBA Finals appearance.</p><p>2. Boston Celtics</p><p>The Celtics had one of the busiest offseasons this summer and only four players remain from last year’s roster. The team acquired Kyrie Irving (from the Cleveland Cavaliers) and Gordon Hayward (via free agency), while trading Isaiah Thomas (to the Cavaliers), Avery Bradley (to the Detroit Pistons) and Jae Crowder (to the Cavaliers). The Celtics are better than they were last year, as they now sport a starting lineup of Irving, Jaylen Brown, Hayward, Marcus Morris and Al Horford. After losing to the Cavaliers last year in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics will try to take the next step and advance to the NBA Finals.</p><p>3. Toronto Raptors</p><p>Led by an all-star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors hope to make the Eastern Conference Finals. With the acquisition of CJ Miles, the Raptors improved their starting lineup, which now consists of Lowry, DeRozan, Miles, Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas. While the Raptors have a shot of making the Conference Finals, their lackluster bench may hold them back.</p><p>4. Washington Wizards</p><p>With a young core of John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr., the Wizards are hoping to finally get past the second round of the playoffs. This is definitely a possibility this season, as all three will look to take the next step forward. However, an injury-prone Beal and a weak frontcourt may lead to their downfall.</p><p>5. Milwaukee Bucks</p><p>With blossoming superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo leading this young team, the Bucks are improving every season. Their starting lineup, made up of 2017 Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Jabari Parker, Antetokounmpo and Greg Monroe, is formidable. This starting lineup and deep bench have potential to be perennial powerhouse in the East.</p><p>6. Miami Heat</p><p>This season, potential all-star Hassan Whiteside, Goran Dragic, and Dion Waiters look to lead the Heat to the playoffs. Dragic and Waiters are skilled offensive players and Whiteside is one of the best rim protectors in the league. Along with this strong core, the Heat added Kelly Olynyk to the bench that already ranked fifth in scoring last year. This bench will help relieve the core of some of the scoring burden and will push the Heat back to the playoffs.</p><p>7. Charlotte Hornets</p><p>After acquiring Dwight Howard and drafting Malik Monk, the Hornets are in a good position to make the playoffs this year. In desperate need of a solid rebounder, Howard and his 12.7 rebounds per game will help the team. Monk will also bring good scoring off the bench, a necessity as they ranked 19th in scoring.</p><p>8. Detroit Pistons</p><p>The Pistons traded Marcus Morris to the Celtics for Avery Bradley this offseason. This move counteracts the hole of not re-signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Jon Leuer is capable of replacing Morris. Bradley also brings much needed defense compliment to the defensive-liability Reggie Jackson. Matching those two with Andre Drummond will make this team good enough to sneak into the playoffs.</p><p>9. Philadelphia 76ers</p><p>The 76ers have one of the best young cores in the league, made up of Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric and Joel Embiid. They have a great shot at making the playoffs, but the team is young and injury-prone, making it hard to expect much this coming year.</p><p>10. New York Knicks</p><p>Now that the Phil Jackson era is finally over, budding superstar Kristaps Porzingis will look to lead the Knicks to the playoffs amidst trade rumors surrounding Carmelo Anthony. However, the Knicks will not be able to make the playoffs because there is not enough talent on the team to support Porzingis and Anthony.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:52:28.800842	25	1	With the NBA offseason coming to a close, we rank all the teams in the NBA.
222	﻿Corr and Schneiderman Elected Freshman Caucus Leaders	corr-and-schneiderman-elected-freshman-caucus-leaders	<p>Katerina Corr and Jonathan Schneiderman were elected Freshman Caucus President and Vice President on Monday, November 6. The two new student body leaders received 112 votes, defeating their opponents, Eric Han and Noa Morris, who received 60 votes.</p><p>Corr and Schneider’s campaign focused on building on the work of previous freshman caucuses and offering solutions to existing issues. They advocated for a locker exchange program for freshmen who were dissatisfied with their locker placement, and for a more organized printing station. In addition, they hoped to implement policies that would allow cellphone usage in the hallways. “[We] tried to talk to as many people as we could [...] the campaign only promised things that we knew were possible,” Corr and Schneider’s campaign manager Talia Kahan said in an e-mail interview. “A lot of the other campaigns were promising things that were never going to happen [like] music in the halls, and this made them look a little bit less reliable.”</p><p>Corr and Schneider’s emphasis on creating a pragmatic platform may have swung the election in their favor. “I agreed with the policies of [Corr and Schneider’s] campaign because they could realistically be implemented and weren’t unnecessary or extravagant. [Corr and Schneider] promoted the change I wanted to see for the freshman class,” freshman Julian Giordano said.</p><p>Han and Morris’ platform had centered around giving students more opportunities to voice their opinions. One of the campaign’s main proposals was the expansion of homeroom representation in the caucus by designating a representative for each homeroom. Han and Morris also proposed a policy to allow students to review their teachers, but did not have a clear plan for implementation.</p><p>The campaign acknowledged that students may have misinterpreted their focus on new issues and new ideas.  “Our policies were among the most controversial aspects of the election [...] I [found that] most people [misunderstood] what we meant when we promised those as policies,” Han said in an e-mail interview. “We did not promise [that] they were going to happen. Our promise was that [we would] fight with all of the effort and passion that we could to implement them, because we believe they would best benefit the freshman class.”</p><p>Despite the heated exchanges between the supporters of both campaigns on social media, voter turnout for this year was significantly lower than last year. Compared to last year’s turnout of over 300, only 172 people voted in this election. “There's so much voter apathy and it's a problem that's been occurring for years at [Stuyvesant]. We try our best to encourage candidates to promote voting first and foremost before promoting their campaigns, because the truth of the matter is a lack of voting hurts the candidates the most,” Board of Elections co-chair Jennifer Lee said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Regardless of the low turnout, Corr and Schneiderman plan to focus on reform that will help them gain the confidence of the student body. “We aren't concerned with changing the school. We are here to make freshman year as great as possible for the class of '21,” Corr said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-04 20:12:26.77541	7	1	Covering the Freshman Caucus campaign and election process of this year and interviewing the new Freshman Caucus President and Vice President
32	﻿New Research Partnership to Help Young Stuyvesant Scientists Flourish	new-research-partnership-to-help-young-stuyvesant-scientists-flourish	<p>Stuyvesant hosted a summer research poster presentation organized by The Young Scientist Foundation (YSF), a research mentorship program, on Monday, August 28. Seniors Marta Pawluczuk and Rochelle Vayntrub were invited to showcase their work alongside 12 other NYC students. The presentation was part of a new partnership between the school and the program to develop research opportunities at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Efforts to expand Stuyvesant’s research program began during the summer of 2016 when Principal Eric Contreras met with YSF President and co-founder Dr. Goutham Narla. YSF members were invited to the school to tour the building and to observe students in action during their science classes. “[YSF] already had relationships with some other schools in the area. I was actually surprised that we hadn’t done this before,” Contreras said. “I’ve been thinking about strategic ways of building our research and science programs. Our collaboration with the Young Scientist Foundation is just one of many pieces to developing these programs.”</p><p>As part of its program, YSF matched students to laboratories and mentors around the city. Pawluczuk worked with a medical student and a head-and-neck surgeon in the Division of Endocrine Surgery at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center. Her research looked at the significance and occurrence of perineural invasion, the spread of cancer around nerves.</p><p>Vayntrub worked at the Platelet Research Laboratory at the New York Blood Center under the mentorship of Dr. Bruce Sachais. There, she was involved in the development of a novel drug to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, a disorder which creates or enlarges blood clots.</p><p>Pawluczuk and Vayntrub both struggled to find research opportunities before this program. “I had always wanted to participate in research, but as a high school student, it was extremely difficult for me to find and acquire any position in a laboratory despite my persistence. Very few scientists were willing to open their labs to young people,” Vayntrub said in an e-mail interview. “Thanks to [YSF], the door to the Platelet Research Laboratory is always open, and I will always have somewhere to come back to.”</p><p>Both students believe the partnership gave them more access to research than they expected to have and valuable experience for the future. “I was blown away by the fact that [...] as a high school student, I was doing the same level of research as a third year medical resident,” Pawluczuk said in an e-mail interview. “By allowing me to experience all sides of research, I feel better suited for future steps I want to take to help me reach my career goals.”</p><p>The positive response from Stuyvesant’s participants in the program has motivated Contreras to develop plans to enhance the school’s science program. “In other initiatives, I’m working on an engineering program at Stuyvesant,” Contreras said. “We’ll make sure to provide the foundational classes that allow students to pursue more advanced classes, prepare them to be knowledgeable in those areas, and inspire them to make connections and collaborations beyond those areas.”</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:55:51.529142	1	1	Stuyvesant has recently established a relationship with the Young Scientist Foundation, which held a presentation where two Stuyvesant students were invited to showcase their scientific discoveries.
33	﻿Otherwise Lost: Stories from Suresnes	otherwise-lost-stories-from-suresnes	<p>When I learned that I was going to Paris with my family during the summer, the first thing that came into my mind was one name: Calvin William Greene, World War I soldier and Stuyvesant graduate.</p><p>Greene’s story had been brought to life by senior Dawei Huang as part of history teacher David Hanna and his AP U.S. History students’ contributions to the Monuments Project. The Monuments Project was started by the American School of Paris. It centers around honoring and telling the stories of the soldiers interred at Suresnes American Cemetery, just outside of Paris.</p><p>Since senior Justin Chan had found Greene’s name etched into the bronze plaque on the first floor, Mr. Hanna had talked a lot about how wonderful it would be to have someone go to France and visit Greene’s resting place in person. They could bring a little piece from the Stuyvesant of the today to the gravesite of a soldier who graduated one hundred years ago: a small pennant donated by the Stuyvesant Alumni Association.</p><p>I was honored to be able to be that person. In France, I met the American School of Paris Middle School Director, Jeffrey Lippman, and the Technology Integrator and leader of the Monuments Project, Claude Lord, at the cemetery on August 17.</p><p>After introducing ourselves and walking around the cemetery a bit, we found Greene’s grave. I remember thinking about what it would have been like to talk to him. On the surface, he seemed stoic and even a little bit intimidating. In one of the two pictures of him, Greene was dressed in full army get-up. In the other, he wore a three-piece suit. He was a star athlete in tennis, and he was the manager of the rowing team. Like your typical Stuyvesant student, he had the grades, too. Albeit, not the academic grades, but the physical: Greene passed the army’s training and conditioning tests with a resounding 99 percent score. A Second Lieutenant at the age of twenty, Greene was one of the youngest officers in the United States Aviation Corps.</p><p>What would he think of a Stuyvesant student body that is now co-ed and three-quarters Asian? Or of the new building, 10 stories high, not even being in Stuytown? I can’t imagine any of my fellow classmates becoming officers in the army two or three years from now, but then again, could he have imagined the academic reputation that Stuyvesant has now? We live in completely different worlds, 100 years apart. Even though, looking at a map of Manhattan, if he were alive today, we’d only live two miles apart.</p><p>After a moment spent taking in the scene and posing for a couple of pictures, the American official on site, Matthew Brown, came up to us and offered a tour of the grounds. He explained the history of the cemetery as we walked around.</p><p>Although there hadn’t actually been any fighting in Paris during World War I, the site of the cemetery had been chosen so nearby for good reason. Each one of the 1,541 American soldiers buried at Suresnes who had served in World War I had gotten wounded on the front lines, had been taken to the American Hospital, and hadn’t made it. The cemetery sits on the slope of a hill. At the top, there is a commemorative chapel, from which we could see into Paris from above. The chapel has two wings, one in memory of the American soldiers from World War I, the other in memory of those from World War II (there are 24 graves dedicated to unknown dead from WWII as well). The walls of the chapel are lined with four bronze plaques. They bear the names of 974 additional missing American soldiers from WWI, most of whom, Brown told us, were presumably killed by German U-Boat attacks before they could make it across the Atlantic.</p><p>From that vantage point on top of the hill, we could also see through a web of trees down to the American Hospital. Brown explained to us that, at the start of the war, the hospital had only 30 or 40 beds, but by the war’s end, it could hold almost 650.</p><p>One fact that I remember very clearly from our tour was when we saw, etched in marble, a list of the other dozen or so American WWI cemeteries in France. Next to the name of each of the cemeteries was the number of soldiers that had been buried there. The American Cemetery at Suresnes was one of the smallest.</p><p>I remember thinking that the sheer amount of death in WWI was incomprehensible.</p><p>The work that the Monuments Project is doing is so important because it helps to shine a light on Americans of the past who, otherwise, would be lost in the numbers and the statistics, For me, my fellow students, and the entire Stuyvesant community to be a part of that experience—by connecting through Greene—was really something special.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:56:24.778781	9	1	When I learned that I was going to Paris with my family during the summer, the first thing that came into my mind was one...
34	﻿Assuming Altruism	assuming-altruism	<p>Rafael Matesanz reviews the numbers released by Spain’s Ministry of Health from his office. As the director of the institution in charge of Spain’s organ transplant system, he quickly crunches the numbers—4,360 transplants carried out in 2014 means the organ donation rate has risen from 14 donors per million citizens in the late 20th century to 36 per million. This places Spain at the top of the list in terms of global organ donations, surpassing the United States and France at 26 per million and Germany at 11 per million.</p><p>Matesanz does not attribute Spain’s incredible numbers to exceptional citizen altruism. In an interview with Newsweek, when asked if Spanish citizens have a “unique store of generosity,” he shook his head, replying, “We have asked the same question in various surveys over the years and every time 56 percent or 57 percent say they would donate their organs after dying … [that’s] roughly the EU average.” He cites a newly streamlined organ donation process as the key. That, in conjunction with Spain’s donation laws, seems to be the key in attaining such high numbers. Yet the feasibility of the U.S. following such a model remains up in the air.</p><p>Currently, the deceased donation system in the U.S. works as follows: you must first sign up to put your name on the donor list with your state’s Organ Donor Registry via the Department of Motor Vehicles. You have the opportunity to choose which tissues or organs you wish to donate as well as the freedom to change your donation status at any time. In the unfortunate instance that you are ever left brain dead, doctors will work in conjunction with a representative from the closest Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) branch (which is a private non-profit organization). Following approval, the OPO will contact the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), which matches donors to their recipients.</p><p>In 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducted a national survey on organ donation behaviors and beliefs. Similar to the proportions in 1993 and 2005, adults in the U.S. consistently maintain a positive view of organ donation, with 94.9 percent supporting or strongly supporting organ donation. That 94.9 percent, however, reveals a stark contrast between ideological beliefs and actual action when you consider that only 60.1 percent of adults have signed up to be a donor.</p><p>Even of those that refused to sign up, only a quarter cited either religion or health as reasons for not donating. The rest reported reasons such as “undecided/don’t know” and “not interested,” demonstrating indifference as opposed to legitimate barriers.</p><p>Combating this passivity is the first step the U.S. must take in order to provide transplants for the more than 116,000 people waiting for a donation. But history makes it clear that passivity—in the face of the most recent presidential election—is going nowhere. It then follows that one viable option is to implement the presumed consent system.</p><p>Presumed consent, a system that France implemented earlier this year, is also known as an “opt-out” system, meaning that it is assumed all citizens wish to donate unless they explicitly state they do not wish to. And in the first few days, only 150,000 people out of the population of 66 million opted out.</p><p>Not only does presumed consent battle passivity, it also changes the context in which we view organ donation. A 2012 study done by researchers at Cornell University and Stanford University revealed that in an “opt-in” system, like that of the U.S., citizens see organ donation as an “exceptional act of altruism.” Yet in an “opt-out” system, the refusal to donate becomes the exceptional act. In other words, the “opt-in” system is like leaving your entire estate to charity. The “opt-out” system is like skipping your daughter’s wedding to sleep in. The former requires some hint of virtue, while the latter is simply a given.</p><p>The second thing we must do is aim to focus our efforts on education and efficiency. The benefits and risks of organ donations must be taught to students before they make the personal decision to remove their names from the list of potential donors. In addition, the idea that Americans and their families will lose freedom over their bodies after death must be set straight. In reality, doctors in the U.S. will respect the family’s ultimate decision as they determine what will happen with their kin’s body. This is due to a few factors, including a combination of fear of legal conflict and bad publicity, as well as an understanding that keeping the body intact may bring the family closure.</p><p>Looking to Spain as the model of efficiency, the country has implemented an initiative to train 16,000 professionals to be both transplant coordinators and internal care specialists, instead of having to tread through the complex networks of hospitals and outside organizations. Germany especially has an extremely low donation record because of an “uncontrollably complex web of private clinics and insurance firms.” The U.S. must ensure that the OPO and OPTN work not as private companies with a government affiliation, but transparent government branches with more uniform standards and training methods for staff. Though this will require an investment of time and resources, it will prevent viable donations from slipping through the cracks that our inefficient system currently has.</p><p>Ultimately, complete consent and altruism must remain the crux of organ donation. A redesigned standard donation procedure and presumed consent will not change that.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:57:01.744998	2	1	The U.S. should adopt a presumed consent organ donation system.
36	﻿Being Attracted to Kids Is Not a Choice, but It Can Be Helped	being-attracted-to-kids-is-not-a-choice-but-it-can-be-helped	<p>One could hope that people in the future will be able to publicly say, “I suffer from pedophilia,” just like they can say, “I suffer from severe depression.”</p><p>Few sexual taboos are as universally reviled as pedophilia, and it is one of the most heavily punished sexual crimes in the criminal justice system, with sentences upward of five years. Copulation and molestation often lead to grave problems in victims, such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. This is not to mention all of the children whose lives are uprooted for the sake of making child pornography.</p><p>With the heinous consequences of their sexual preferences in mind, it is very easy to harshly indict pedophiles as deserving of castration or even, as Trump has suggested, the death penalty. While pedophilia has devastating effects on its victims, the majority of the populace ignores an inconvenient truth—that pedophilia is compulsory, and thus deserves to be categorized as a mental disorder.</p><p>Pedophiles are too often seen as depraved fiends who target children using verbal and emotional manipulation, and find pleasure in doing so. But the reality is that the vast majority of pedophiles are terrified by their own urges and the thought of turning them into reality appalls them. In fact, the World Health Organization’s definition of “disorders of sexual preference” includes the phrase “acts on the urges or is markedly distressed by them.” Though the exact causes of pedophilic tendencies are unknown, they are heavily linked to experiences such as being molested as a child or conditions such as brain damage.</p><p>Consider for a moment how homosexuals (who also technically have an involuntary alternate sexual preference) have been treated throughout most of the course of human history. Sodomy was, and still is in some places, a crime punishable by stoning, flogging, or death. One could find many parallels between the now-outdated views toward gays and the still-relevant ones toward pedophiles, from the calls for castration to those for execution. If only they looked to Paul’s words in Timothy 1:8-10, which state, “We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful…the sexually immoral,” the harsh view of those considered “sexually immoral” in those times reflects the way many people today see pedophiles.</p><p>Of course, there is a crucial difference between these two types of sexual differences, which is that pedophilia, unfortunately, has a victim. There just isn’t a way for it to be tolerated when it can be so damaging to the child. There is no way to fully resolve the problem, so pedophiles must instead look to treatment for salvation.</p><p>Currently, no person who has pedophilic tendencies would even consider sharing his or her problems or trying to get help for the condition—the societal backlash and ostracization could ruin the person’s social prospects and career. Instead, one of two things happens: either their attraction is suppressed with no one to talk to about it (a prospect that seems torturous for a person of any sexual orientation), or, even worse, their pedophilia is acted upon in secrecy.</p><p>It’s unimaginable that we would, as a society, allow schizophrenics to have their mental state remain untreated and potentially have it degraded to the point where they would turn to violence. Schizophrenia, in its acute forms, can cause people to have psychotic breakouts that in some cases lead to aggression. That raises a question: why is it that society accepts the diagnosing and treating of schizophrenia, but not of pedophilia?</p><p>Going forward, there are two options: the first is to offer the pedophile no helpful resources to deal with his or her sexual urges and then proceed to castigate and ostracize them if they offend, effectively ruining their lives. The second is to offer confidential, easily accessible treatment to anyone who feels he or she could offend and prevent this. For instance, the Charité hospital in Germany offers anonymous therapy sessions, and patients’ privacy is protected by Germany’s strict confidentiality laws unless there are criminal charges currently pending against them.</p><p>Ultimately, instead of launching witch hunts against groups of people, which society is prone to do, we should attempt to see what makes them likely to offend, recognize that it’s not their choice to be attracted to children, and try to find a method of prevention. Recent decades have seen a push to reduce the stigma attached to mental disorders such as depression in Western culture. It would be a more onerous task for the same shift to occur with pedophilia, but one could hope that people in the future will be able to publicly say, “I suffer from pedophilia,” just like they can say, “I suffer from severe depression.”</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:58:13.871512	2	1	
40	﻿Hollywood’s Misrepresentation of Asians	hollywood-s-misrepresentation-of-asians	<p>Art/Photo Request:</p><p>Is #HollywoodSoWhite still trending? It should be. Time and time again, Hollywood has disappointed with its lack of diversity. Sure, there’s the occasional black protagonist, but there’s more to diversity than just black and white.</p><p>Hollywood consistently delivers Asian stereotypes in its films and oftentimes, movies are “whitewashed” in favor of white actors because of the negative impact of these stereotypes.</p><p>Hollywood’s negative representation of Asians has probably existed since Hollywood’s beginning in 1853. Around the time that Hollywood was starting to gain traction, “yellow peril” was a major fear of the white population in the U.S., Canada, and overseas. This fear stemmed from the idea that whites would be overwhelmed by the influx of East Asian immigrants, contributing to perceptions that Asians would spread their foreign culture and language and would steal jobs. Today, Asian Americans are often labeled intellectual and assimilatory and thus still threatening to white jobs in technology sectors. These perceptions are the origin of Asian stereotypes that are perpetuated in Hollywood to this day.</p><p>These stereotypes lead to active “whitewashing” of films. There is a term called “racial prototypicality” where someone who looks authentically like a certain race is unconsciously given a label based on stereotypes. For example, someone who looks black may be immediately portrayed as violent and harboring delinquency. Asians are viewed as smart in only the STEM fields and as being unable to socialize well. “Whitewashing” is a subset of racial prototypicality in that casting directors unconsciously associate Asian actors with stereotypes that would make Asians unfit to be actors, even in films that are associated with Asians specifically.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson was cast as the lead in the live-action movie “Ghost in a Shell” based on the Japanese anime of the same name. The casting of a white woman instead of an Asian one caused an uproar. In an interview with Marie Claire Magazine, Johansson refuted claims of racism, saying, “Having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity.” Believe it or not, having a franchise with an Asian female protagonist is an even rarer one. Johansson instead claimed that the movie role was about feminism in an attempt to avoid the racism discussion. Excuses like these perpetuate whitewashing by avoiding conversations about its destructive impacts. More people should be addressing the stereotypes and consequent “whitewashing” that occurs in films.</p><p>Marvel’s “Doctor Strange” received backlash for its choice to cast white actor Tilda Swinton to play the role of a Tibetan monk. In August, Netflix released “Death Note,” which is based on a Japanese anime and manga. Like “Ghost in a Shell,” the movie features a predominantly white cast. When trying to audition for the role of protagonist Light Yagami in “Death Note,” one Asian American actor, Edward Zo, stated that he “was told to [his] face that they were not looking to see Asian actors for the role of Light Yagami.” Instead of an Asian actor, Netflix has changed Light Yagami to Light Turner to accommodate for white actor Nat Wolff’s role as the protagonist.</p><p>“The Great Wall” starring Matt Damon is an example of white assimilation on-screen and whitewashing off-screen. The movie is about a European man, William, from medieval times who tries to assimilate into 11th-century Asian society in order to find a rumored substance to improve European life. Such a film demonstrates the concept of white saviorism where the whites save the day with exceptional ability that exceeds that of foreigners.</p><p>Along with white saviorism, negative stereotypes about Asians play into the environment of the movie considerably. The film depicts hundreds of thousands of Chinese warriors ready to fight against the enemy but shows most of them quickly dying in the first few moments of battle as if the Chinese are not capable of defending themselves. William, however, deals more damage with a bow and arrows than the complicated weapons technology that the Chinese have at hand. He also fearlessly dives into the fray to fight for the Chinese even though it is made obvious from the start of the film that William has little intention of helping foreigners with their affairs.</p><p>Off-screen, the movie may have been directed by an Asian and featured a cast of several notable Asian actors, but the storyline was written by at least seven white men. It is mind-boggling how a movie featuring predominantly Asians was not written by any.</p><p>In Hollywood, stereotypes are a large factor in how films are produced and how Asians are viewed in the film industry. Bad associations prevent Asians from playing bigger roles in movies even when those movies require actual Asians. The first step and the only way that Asians can start to have roles in films is to stop audiences and casting directors from harboring negative racist stereotypes that exclude Asians from major roles. People need to stop making excuses and truly address the oppression of Asians in the film industry. Without doing so, one of the largest populations in the world will continuously be judged based on rude misconceptions.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:52:24.79867	28	1	Without Asians holding more responsibility, Hollywood is able to continue with its bad casting decisions and racist stereotypes.
398	﻿Toward a Transparent Student Union	toward-a-transparent-student-union	<p>In an interview with The Spectator last spring, Student Union (SU) President Tahseen Chowdhury said, “Every SU in the past and every platform that you’ve seen in the past always have specific ideas, and we lack that, and that’s good.” But the SU’s failure to communicate specific goals, or sometimes even to communicate at all, has only caused it to seem out-of-touch—there is an SU hotline, for instance, but Stuyvesant does not allow students to make phone calls in school.</p><p>This is not to say the SU is superfluous. It has had some successes, such as providing stuy.edu e-mail addresses, attempting to enforce a homework policy, and setting up the printing station.</p><p>But for every achievement, there are multiple failed or useless projects: promising and not delivering a locker trading system for the fall of 2017; not reliably helping clubs make their own websites through StuyClubPub.org; inability to enforce allowing students in early from their lunch periods; and the disappearance of bathroom hooks, to name a few.</p><p>Some ventures, like opening up the fifth floor balcony, seem both unattainable and arbitrarily chosen. Similarly, the freshmen and sophomore caucuses devote most of their energies towards planning grade dances like Semi-Formal, despite these events not being met with similar enthusiasm from the student body.</p><p>SU members often argue that their accomplishments are backstage, such as haggling with administration over student autonomy or organizing SING! logistics. Even if the SU is incredibly productive “behind-the-scenes,” the fact that their primary functions are nearly invisible—not advertised to, or understood by, most students—indicates a lack of dialogue with their constituents.</p><p>Students receive few updates on what their student officials are doing. Though SU e-mails are constant, these are almost always weekly schedules or reminders about school events, rather than providing insight on SU projects or requests for student input.</p><p>The SU has attempted to establish communication through other means, namely Facebook posts and video updates. Besides being difficult to access for students who are not regular Facebook users (which particularly hurts freshmen who may not be accustomed to Stuyvesant’s Facebook-heavy culture), these posts also do not provide significant information about the SU’s work, but rather list upcoming events.</p><p>Another issue with the SU’s communication is its size. The SU has been aggressively expanding, and now has approximately 250 members. Many new positions have been formed, such as the Director of Music and Supplies in the Freshman Caucus, and the SU has stated that they want to increase the number of task forces to handle new problems and projects. These new titles are part of a push to make the SU more inclusive, but they have instead created bureaucratic bloat.</p><p>This attempt at inclusion through creating hundreds of positions is an ineffective solution that leaves the rest of the student body isolated. Indeed, the SU is often seen as an exclusive club, disconnected from non-SU member peers and operating within their own social circle.</p><p>Oversizing also leads to inefficiency. The current SU fails to reap the benefits of specialized lower offices. Mobility between different departments is high, leaving many officers unacquainted with their duties. The lower offices often redirect student concerns to higher offices anyway. Students needing assistance then become unsure as to whom they should approach. Redundant and vague positions such as the freshman caucus’s multiple chiefs of staff and advisors only add to the confusion.</p><p>Lower offices are also difficult to locate on the websites of the various caucuses. Many important pages, such as the “task forces” menu button on the SU website and the advisory council page of the sophomore caucus, do not open up or do not have content. Chowdhury and SU Vice President Alexa Valentino’s platform states, “Task forces are designed to be started rapidly to ensure that we take on any good ideas.” But the near invisibility of these task forces—names, officers, guidelines, or mission statements are nowhere to be found—makes it difficult to contact them with problems or to know what they have accomplished.</p><p>Another of the Student Union’s biggest tasks is managing over $100,000 and dispersing that among clubs and publications. But the page for budget information on their website directs students to a Google document from last school year, with Niels Graham, an alumnus, as the listed contact. The updated “Clubs and Pubs Rules and Regulations” sheet specifies that clubs must complete “appropriate paperwork available at the SU website,” and that the SU only appropriates funds at certain times throughout the year. Neither the dates nor the form are readily available online.</p><p>As a result of this lack of transparency, when the SU accomplishes something (or fails to), students don’t always know; when students are told the SU has accomplished something, they rarely know how or why.</p><p>The SU should redefine its role to be the intermediary between students and the administration. As the most direct link between the two, the SU should be the main advocate for student needs.</p><p>In this capacity, the SU can focus its energies on incorporating student opinions. Before pursuing large-scale undertakings, the SU should poll the student body. This could be as simple as a Google form with a paragraph proposing a change, a one-to-five rating scale, and a space for additional comments. The survey’s results should be made public so that students know what the SU will be doing, and on what basis. Similarly, occasional surveys could also be used to poll student opinion on current SU endeavors, in order to see whether continuing them is a good investment of resources.</p><p>Better advertising SU cabinet meetings, or holding town halls, would also provide non-SU members with a forum to listen to and question the leaders of the student body, as well as provide their own recommendations. The result of increased engagement with students would be more clearly defined goals, with a larger support-base, that the SU could dedicate its energies toward.</p><p>Revitalizing the “task force dedicated to speaking to you,” which was established in the 2016-17 school year, would also improve communication. This task force is supposed to consist of a group of SU members who walk around the school to discern student opinions. Having them be more active (they only interview about five students per month, according to an SU official) and public about their findings would give the student body more confidence in the SU, and allow students to gain consensus through e-mail, form, or social media from the limited number of students such a task force can reach out to.</p><p>Improved communication can be readily facilitated by consolidating the SU’s bureaucracy. Eliminating unnecessary officials, and clearly delineating which students are responsible for which jobs, would establish a much more navigable chain of command.</p><p>This streamlining would need to be supplemented with an up-to-date website, or some other place with easily available information about the SU (such as physical postings in the school). Clearly explaining who to contact in specific scenarios would go a long way toward establishing confidence and conversation with the student body, without requiring much time or energy on the part of the SU.</p><p>Having some form of government is vital to the student body: it provides an outlet for complaints, a channel to the administration, and a way to organize and actualize the student body’s desires. Many of the SU’s current projects fulfill these responsibilities; however, there are many more from which students are kept in the dark. The first step for the SU to become an effective intermediary is greater transparency.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:45:20.543401	2018-01-23 02:45:20.659477	8	1	
394	﻿What’s on Your Nose?	what-s-on-your-nose	<p>Often written in between the lines of the grade breakdown on the syllabus is the liberty some teachers reserve to include intangibles, such as participation, engagement, or, in some cases, good old-fashioned brown-nosing. Opinions writers went out to determine the nature of kissing up at Stuyvesant, to find out how teachers respond to it (spoiler alert: a number refused or were reluctant to discuss it at all), and to consider their own stances.</p><p><h4>Mia Gindis, sophomore</h4></p><p>I’ve always made the effort to give my teachers gifts over the holidays. There was never any ulterior motive—I simply wanted to show my gratitude for their ability to deal with me for an entire semester.</p><p>Regardless, the distinction between genuine kindness and a kid who's just looking for a curve next marking period shouldn’t need to be made, because either way, a present shouldn’t affect anything. There have even been instances of teachers returning to students gifts they deemed too expensive. Teachers should always accept the gift; it just shouldn't change their minds grading-wise. Handing a gift back almost exclusively shows that it would.</p><p><h4>Jessy Mei, sophomore</h4></p><p>Is it really moral to justify and normalize this culture of being untrue to one’s abilities and personality to gain favor with a teacher? Though the intent may be shallow, hopes of achieving academic success can push students out of their comfort zones to participate or seek help in subjects they struggle in, developing their knowledge and understanding of the topic, pushing them to learn and strive for success. However, when those hopes become too ambitious and students wander out of the academic field into the field of achieving personal bias from teachers, hardworking students become punished for their honesty and academic effort. In the case where a strong work ethic and integrity [don’t] suffice to succeed or do well in class, the line becomes blurred, but in most cases, there are always alternative steps to better one’s grade. Ultimately, it is up to us how we proceed in our four years at Stuyvesant, but when it comes to gifts, it is always best to keep it simple and handwritten, because even the most expensive gifts won’t carry our grade, but the things we will remember once we graduate are the teachers who gave us the opportunity to learn and thrive.</p><p><h4>Jonela Malollari, junior</h4></p><p>Kissing up to teachers as a substitute for working for your grade is desperate at best and pitiful at worst. Stuyvesant may not be perfect, but the whole point of the grading system is that your grades are supposed to reflect the amount of effort you put into a class and your progress in your understanding of the material. It’s not supposed to illustrate how well you can win someone's favor. I get that there's often a very real sense of desperation behind a poor grade that makes students resort to things, however minor or inconsequential, that they would usually consider beneath them. But for success to mean anything, you have to take what you get whether you earned it positively or negatively. A number isn't worth your integrity. As for teachers who blatantly buy into and encourage favoritism in their classroom, why would you lower yourself to their level?</p><p>Some students claim that sucking up is necessary to improve their college applications, but this argument is flimsy. Whether the points a student scores from brown-nosing are negligible or significant, if you’re doing well in most of your classes, you don’t need to depend on manipulative tactics, and good grades are usually indicative of a strong work ethic regardless. If you’re generally an excellent student but happen to end up with an unfair teacher, the grade that teacher gives you will stand out as an obvious outlier. Students who rely on ingratiation as a crutch are more likely to have a poor work ethic anyway, and if you’re doing poorly in most of your classes, brown-nosing isn’t going to remedy that. Even if it did, so what? Maybe this is overly idealistic, but high school and college are temporary; the type of person you are and the decisions you make are infinitely more important.</p><p><h4>Emily Hur, junior</h4></p><p>In the end, all Stuyvesant students are striving for the same goal: good grades. While some may fulfill this dream, others will fall short. Abandoning integrity in favor of pursuing a higher grade may be inherently wrong, but ultimately, it’s a tradition that may follow many of us into the workplace. We resort to kissing up as a grade-boosting tactic and use hasty excuses to justify it, and we convince ourselves it’s the competitive atmosphere and even deceive ourselves by maintaining that we’re “just being nice.” But in the end, brown-nosing can facilitate a harsher, more cutthroat environment at school.</p><p>While this practice certainly shouldn’t be condoned, it shouldn’t be persecuted, and [it] is up to the volition of individual students. Ultimately, teachers and the administration should use their own discretion and not allow gifts to cloud their judgments, while students should also prioritize merit and honesty over trying to gain an edge over others.</p><p><h4>Anne Rhee, freshman</h4></p><p>I feel that it is very important to recognize the different levels of attention or appreciation given to a teacher in order to really define what “kissing up” is. On one side, I do believe that flattery, or even constant appreciation shown to a teacher, is often wrong, since it is a waste of time to flatter a teacher rather than work hard and get good grades. From my personal experience, I have seen many students try hard to get their teachers’ attentions, but every student has different ways of expressing this. It is not only about the way this attention is shown, but also why the students “kiss up.” Because of the constant reason of “college applications” or a “recommendation” to justify why they try to experience a better relationship with their teacher, I feel that you must create this relationship in other ways. Students and teachers should get along because they have common interests or [because] they become friends, rather than [by] buying their attentions with presents or generic compliments. Not only is the foundation for this type of friendship stronger, but [it is] also guaranteed to be genuine and last longer.</p><p><h4>Angela Wong, freshman</h4></p><p>Why does going the extra mile in school, such as by participating in class, complimenting teachers, or giving gifts around the holidays, have such a negative connotation? When the mindset behind flattery is to receive a curved grade, the line is drawn between putting in enthusiasm and being fake. When one’s intentions are self-interested, such flattery loses its true meaning and instead becomes “kissing up.” The easiest way to distinguish between deceitful and genuine intentions is by asking, “If I knew my grade would not be altered by my flattering actions, would I still do them?”</p><p><h4>Bryan Monge Serrano, sophomore</h4></p><p>These occurrences show that brown-nosing is a big pandemic in our school community, but I believe that this issue should be and has been handled by teachers responsibly. Teachers should be responsible and reasonable with gifts [and] not [let] them interfere with their grading. If the teacher is unfair and irresponsible with gift giving, this encourages an environment where some students are punished simply for not having money.</p><p>Teachers are the people who mainly affect the brown-nosing culture since they are the ones receiving the gifts. They must be fair to all students by making clear guidelines of what gifts they will accept and having students blindly give them gifts, so they still know who gave them gifts, but not which gift so as to minimize a change in their grading. Teachers must also be responsible and accept gifts with open arms after they have submitted their finals grades since this also promotes a fair environment where students do not feel cheated, since everyone was graded with the same criteria and with minimal outside factors affecting their grade.</p><p><h4>Anta Noor, junior</h4></p><p>Ever since elementary school, I have given small gifts to teachers during the holiday season as a token of my appreciation. I know many of my friends do the same to show gratitude toward the teacher. I personally think that gift giving is not “kissing up” to a teacher, and it’s more of a friendly notion towards the teacher than an academic one.</p><p>However, I believe “kissing up” or brown-nosing does exist and is acceptable when it comes to unfair teachers. Some of my friends and I have had teachers who show clear favoritism to some students over others, and give grades based on how much they like the student. I think it’s okay to “kiss up” to a teacher if the student knows it will give them a higher grade, because that’s just how the teacher is. It might not seem right, but in the overall outlook, “kissing up” happens in our daily lives a lot because we can gain from it. All in all, I believe “kissing up” is acceptable when it’s directly correlated to the grade the teacher will give you, and if it isn’t, then there’s no need for it.</p><p><h4>Adam Oubaita, junior</h4></p><p>A highly competitive atmosphere such as Stuyvesant is a breeding ground for kissing up. People are always concerned with their grades and always want to improve them, so certain people resort to brown- nosing. While I personally believe in actually doing work instead of hoping for a curve, I can’t blame students for trying to heighten their grade through artificial means.</p><p>However, it is important to note that not everyone has a devious scheme to brown-nose their teachers. There is a sharp distinction between kissing up and being friendly with teachers. When the holiday seasons come along, I write letters to my teachers and impactful people in Stuy expressing my gratitude for the education they provide, the help they offer, and the time they spend. And when writing these letters, I am not expecting my average to rise all of a sudden. Plenty of friends have also given gifts to teachers as a sign of gratitude.</p><p><h4>Maia Brydon, junior</h4></p><p>I haven't really given presents to my teachers since elementary school, and this Christmas was nerve-wracking because it seemed like everyone else was. But in all honesty, I think a lot of the gift-giving and "forced interest" students do is not really done with an ulterior motive (or at least not a conscious one). I admit that a lot of the people who constantly go to talk to teachers after class do seem really obnoxious, but being Stuyvesant students, I think a lot of us actually do that out of genuine interest in what we're asking about. As for gift-giving, I know that at least some people do that out of honest appreciation and courtesy, nothing else. I believe a lot of people subconsciously give gifts in part because they believe it will gain them favor, but I think that's definitely not the only reason for it.</p><p>Even if I understand the motive to kiss up to more unfair teachers, there are never teachers who are unfair to the extent that students are forced to sacrifice their integrity for a grade. But there are certainly teachers who play favorites more than others, which is where it seems students get caught up in brown- nosing. To most Stuyvesant students, I would say, getting a higher grade certainly matters more than your integrity. Especially if it’s just little things, like saying goodbye to a teacher every day, it doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, even if you are giving up your integrity to a certain extent. This mindset extends a lot further than just high school, too—kids suck up to their parents to get what they want, and people in many industries suck up to their bosses to look better. It's just how a lot of people tend to react when they want something—they try to gain favor through little things, little things that they don’t consider all that morally wrong.</p><p><h4>Eric Ferencz, English </h4></p><p>In my opinion, "kissing up" is when a student uses compliments or kindness to manipulate a teacher into giving him/her favorable treatment, particularly if the student is attempting to compensate for some sort of academic shortcoming. I imagine that buckling down and working hard takes much more effort than flattery or affectation.</p><p>Me? I'm much more interested in my students' professional characteristics. Come to class on time. Try to participate once a day. Share with your peers. Hand in your work on time, and if you're going to be late, ask for an extension four days in advance.</p><p><h4>Eric Grossman, Assistant Principal of English</h4></p><p>My sense is that most of the teachers I know are fully capable of appreciating a thoughtful gift, but not letting it have anything to do with their grading practice. In the end, the intent behind giving a gift doesn’t really matter, because it doesn’t have anything to do with it. I tend to always think the best of my students—and not just concerning presents. Ultimately, a grade in class is about the work and the effort that you’ve put into it, and I have students that I’ve thought the world of who’ve done terribly in my classes, because as much as I liked them, they didn’t hand in work. But those are separate things.</p><p><h4>Robert Sandler, U.S. History</h4></p><p>If a kid says hello to me in the hallway, do I think they’re sucking up? I’d say they’re just saying hi. They want me to know who they are, which makes sense; I would do the same thing if I was in their shoes. I think giving somebody a card and saying something nice if they appreciate your passion for teaching or they give you something small like a little token—I don’t see it as a big deal. I think of it as the kids are just trying to express their gratitude. I give my own children’s teachers little tokens—small, inexpensive gifts—and write them cards.</p><p>I’ve never once said to my peer or colleague, “Look at this kid, trying to get a good grade by doing this.” Because it won’t work with me anyway, it’s all based on how they participate, their test scores, so I don’t think about it that much because it never really factors in. If I have a kid after class stay and ask questions, they seem like they’re genuinely interested. Like, is there some part of them that thinks they’re calculating, oh, so this might help them increase their grade? Yeah, that might be part of the calculus, but like, that’s fine, I think that all of our behaviors have multiple motivations behind them.</p><p><h4>Lauren Stuzin, English</h4></p><p>I don’t think I’ve noticed that it’s a problem. I think, first of all, that there’s a distinction to be made between wanting to be professional in class and wanting to make a good impression and being respectful to a teacher versus trying to mask some negative part of your performance in class. Some students may be nice to teachers to compensate for something […] I think students and teachers alike know that this is a thing that could happen in schools, it could happen anywhere, but I haven’t noticed it being an issue.</p><p><h4>Julie Sheinman, English</h4></p><p>The problem with students who are trying to use gifts to get an advantage in terms of grading in the form of a curve for the following marking period, for example, is much greater during the first semester around the holiday season, rather than at the end of the year. This is due to most grades being submitted and done with towards the beginning of June at the end of the year, so the chances of a gift affecting a grade is minimal.</p><p>I think that most students are being kind and genuine when giving presents and I believe teachers should accept the presents as a sign of care and gratitude, but only if they know it will not affect their grading. I myself had to reject a gift card a student gave me since I knew it was something that had a lot of value and could possibly affect my grading.</p><p><h4>Emilio Nieves, English</h4></p><p>If “kissing up to teachers” happens at Stuyvesant, it does so on such a small scale that it's not even worth writing a story about. I think it is a hasty generalization (a logical fallacy!) to assert that "Stuyvesant students, in general, are very good at kissing up to teachers."</p><p>This statement contradicts my experiences at Stuyvesant (17 years), where I have encountered students who are highly motivated to succeed, students who are so appreciative of my efforts that they have given me countless thank-you cards after the course or when they graduate (I have two boxes full in my closet that I can show you), students who walk me out of the classroom and continue the class discussions because they are genuinely intellectually intrigued, and students who consistently utter, "Hi Mr. Nieves!" when they see me on the escalator, in the hallways, or while passing my classroom while I am teaching. So, if hypothetically a handful of students practice the art of "kissing up to teachers," then it doesn't reflect badly on the student body; it reflects badly only on those students who do so.</p><p>Another problem I have with this is that "kissing up to teachers" can only be successful if the teacher allows it to affect his or her judgment. So saying that Stuyvesant students, "in general, are very good at kissing up to teachers," implies that Stuyvesant teachers are gullible, naive, or lacking in moral compass. This is insulting to the caring, hardworking, and honest colleagues that I have the privilege of working with as well as contrary to what I have experienced. So though there may be attempts at "kissing up to teachers," I doubt these attempts are successful.</p><p>Student ingratiation is never a good thing in academia. My view is that if a student is smart enough to devote his time and energy to practice "kissing up to teachers," then they are smart enough to dedicate that time and energy to figuring out the idiosyncrasies of each teacher and adjusting his academic performance accordingly.</p><p><h4>Rebecca Lindenmulder, French and German </h4></p><p>If a student is kissing up to a teacher, it seems to me that he/she is not sincere in the willingness to be helpful, respectful or interested in the material being taught. The teacher may benefit from the cooperativeness and help of the student in question, but in essence, I think we should try to be sincere in our interactions with others and not act in a certain way purely for personal gain. The intention the student has in how they act out their kissing up may also very well be irrelevant—if the student is kissing up in the form of engagement in class, then their engagement nonetheless merits inclusion in a college recommendation. The actions of the student, although maybe more praiseworthy when not done with only the intent of personal gain, are to be included in any case, as they show the student's level of engagement in their studies. To say their kissing up in the form of engagement will guarantee acceptance into a better college would be misleading—I think a variety of factors come into play there.</p><p><h4>Barbara Garber, Health</h4></p><p>I think it’s very hard to tell the difference between “kissing up” and genuinely being kind to the teacher. In most cases, students who participate often show that they’re engaged in the class rather than trying to show off or “kiss up.” In terms of gift giving, if a student gives me a gift, that shows me that they were willing to spend money and time on me, rather than trying to get a grade boost. In my class, I grade based on the work they do and how well they perform on projects, tests, and homework, as well as their engagement in class. I don’t grade based on favoritism or who gets me what gift. Therefore, “kissing up,” even if it does exist in my class, doesn’t affect how I grade because my grades are based on the effort the student puts into my class.</p><p><h4>Meng Ping Tu, Biology and Neurobiology</h4></p><p>Personally, I prefer students to just write me a thank-you card if they really want to say anything. I feel bad about students spending money to buy any sort of presents for a teacher, and I just don’t think it's necessary because my philosophy is that you all give yourselves a grade. I’m here to guide you to learn and to achieve your learning goals for this particular class, but how much you want to do is up to you.</p><p>The maximum is a little thank-you card. I think that's the best. The best and best is if you make your own thank-you card with crayons and paper. I post that—I tape it on my fridge because I think that, to me, is heart.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:44:24.732446	2018-01-28 02:50:01.300568	2	1	
42	﻿A New Music Video Begins a New Era of Taylor Swift	a-new-music-video-begins-a-new-era-of-taylor-swift	<p>“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now,” Taylor Swift’s signature red lips murmur. “Why? Oh…’cause she’s dead.” That might just be a line in Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” but to me, a self-proclaimed “swiftie,” Swift confirmed what I had been fearing before the single came out. We have officially lost the blonde, curly, love song strumming, pop-country girl who had me hooked on her music. I saw this coming after “Red,” her first album to feature non-country pop songs, debuted. However, even as her catchy single “Shake It Off” and the rest of the songs from “1989” came out, I never lost hope that she might go back to the country style of her older songs. Maybe this was because I had grown so attached to the old Swift that I didn’t want to adjust to a new one, but it is undeniable—Swift has changed, and she’s not going back to her old ways any time soon.</p><p>After accepting Swift’s new style and persona, I had to judge: Do I like the new Taylor? Sure, some parts are catchy, but the main chorus, “look what you made me do, look what you made me do,” sounds incredibly repetitive and unfortunately, does not hold any of the stories or meaning that her older songs, such as “Fearless,” held. Because I disliked the song, I held low expectations for the music video, but once it came out, I watched in awe.</p><p>What Swift did in this video makes a bold statement, one I hadn’t expected coming from an artist who is so constantly talked about for scandals and feuds. In the first scene, a graveyard, Swift is shown crawling out from a grave with an inscription that read, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation.” In the third scene, Swift sits upon a throne crawling with snakes, making her the queen of snakes. Other than describing a reptilian animal, a snake can be used to describe someone who often does traitorous and malicious things behind others’ backs. A snake is not something one normally wants to be called, yet in her video Swift seems to be embracing the label.</p><p>After many feuds with a variety of celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry, Swift’s name has been dragged through the dirt. People consider her someone who can’t be trusted. In these scenes, Swift does something many artists would fear to do: not only does she make it clear that she knows her old, innocent persona is long-gone, but she accepts her new reputation as a snake.</p><p>In the rest of the video, Swift features many references to pop culture events and opinions that have affected her in the public eye. In one scene, she is featured robbing a streaming company, perhaps alluding to the hate she got for refusing to sell her music to streaming companies such as Spotify. She is also spotted wearing a sweater saying “blind for love,” a direct nod toward her infamous dating cycle.</p><p>Though these references are clever, the video set is elaborate, and the overall filming is well done; the best part of the entire video for many swifties like myself is the last 10 seconds—the round-up of Swifts. In this final scene, different versions of Taylor Swift, such as the nerdy Swift from the “You Belong With Me” video and the ballerina Swift from “Shake It Off,” line up in a row in front of a cheering audience. They are shown arguing with each other, the old country Swift is crying while the new goth Swift calls her out for “playing the victim, again.”</p><p>The video ends with a comedic last line, referencing the feud between Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, and Taylor Swift, who is dressed in the exact outfit she was wearing at the 2009 VMA’s when West famously declared Swift unfit for the “Video of the Year Award.” This version of Swift mimics what Swift had said to West and Kardashian, during their most recent dispute: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.” Swift, yet again, owns up to past actions that have earned her public hate.</p><p>Just like she embraced her reputation of being a snake in the beginning of the video, in this scene, she seems to call herself out on the things that made others angry or annoyed with her. It is unclear whether she did this to say she doesn’t care if they ridicule her actions or because she wants to show others that she understands her past mistakes. Either way, it is interesting and refreshing to see such a high-level celebrity like her bring up unfortunate past events of her lifetime directly into the limelight.</p><p>So is the “new Taylor” better or worse than the “old Taylor”? She’s neither, but she is definitely different. I can’t judge whether her new style and persona is better or worse because I have to keep in mind that I’m not the only “swiftie” out there. The “new” Taylor may be better for some and worse for others, like me. That’s the beauty of Taylor Swift: she attracts such a variety of fans, especially as her musical style changes.</p><p>Even though I wish she would go back to her 2009 self, her change may be for the best. Swift started her official career in 2006 when her debut album, “Taylor Swift,” came out. Since then, she has produced five complete albums and many more individual songs, aged 11 years, and has been involved in endless amounts of drama. I avoided the complete realization of this, but in the time since 2006, Swift was bound to change. Music styles change, fashion changes, and sometimes, due to certain events, even a persona can change. I might not like the songs of the new Taylor, but it’s comforting to know that just like when I was nine and watched the music video of “You Belong With Me” over and over again, Swift’s sense of humor and cleverness regarding music videos has not changed. “Look What You Made Me Do” combines the new Taylor’s attitude and musical style with the old Taylor’s facial expressions and dramatics, creating a whole different Taylor, one as lovable as before.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:04:39.454255	16	1	“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now,” Taylor Swift’s signature red lips murmur. “Why?

39	﻿When Politics Has a Price Tag	when-politics-has-a-price-tag	<p>The rise of the word “woke” is perhaps one of the best indications of an increasing politically aware pop culture consciousness. Firmly rooted in a younger generation, “woke” is an adjective signifying an above-average and liberal understanding of current affairs, particularly relating to social injustices such as racism. Though originating from the dialect of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), “woke” made its way into the more general public lexicon following the widely publicized 2014 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests (a response to alleged instances of police brutality involving black men such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner). The birth of activist movements such as BLM taken in conjunction with the recent backlash toward President Trump’s treatment of minorities and women have pushed millennials and members of Generation X into an increasingly politically aware mindset.</p><p>While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the notion of an enhanced political awareness, being “woke” becomes an issue when the act is commodified. Artists and celebrities have capitalized on the increasing awareness surrounding legitimate social unrest simply as a means of enhancing their popularity. In other words, being “woke” has often been reduced to a trend. Celebrities lean on a platform of political awareness, without largely caring about the issues beyond what can be visible online to a mass audience.</p><p>Pop singer Katy Perry’s recent single “Chained To The Rhythm” embodies this shallow awareness. Its vague and hardly politically suggestive lyrics lead it to fall heavily short of the anthem meant to “start conversations” that Perry believes to be (as she expressed in a pre-Grammys interview) some sort of musical remedy to the tumultuous political climate. Such a frail attempt at awareness is further undermined when looking back at the singer’s oftentimes problematic behavior; she has repeatedly appropriated other cultures by donning a kimono or cornrows, and encouraged stereotypes through her song “Ur So Gay.”</p><p>Lena Dunham is another celebrity who holds herself as a political role model for feminism. However, she has instead succeeded in becoming the poster child of “white feminism,” a term that has also gained traction in recent years, likely as a response to the increasingly ingenuine environment of political awareness. This refers to feminism that fails to recognize the greater oppression experienced by underprivileged, especially non-white, women. While Dunham has used her status as a feminist as a foundation for many aspects of her career, (including starting “Lenny Letter,” a feminist newsletter), her shaky stance has also been revealed at times. In a few instances, she allegedly made racist remarks about black American football player Odell Beckham Jr. and actor Michael B. Jordan, revealing that her apparent passion for equality does not extend to people of color.</p><p>Alternately, preeminent fashion model Kendall Jenner’s recent advertisement for Pepsi represents a rare moment when this sort of shallow awareness was widely recognized and disparaged. Jenner’s participation in such an ad (which, in attempting to sell the beverage, utilized scenes from protests akin to Black Lives Matter) represents one of the purest examples of political awareness becoming merely a commodity.</p><p>Though the immense criticism received by both Jenner and the brand Pepsi led to the ad being pulled, similar, more subtle instances from other artists, such as Katy Perry, often go unnoticed. The perpetrators continue to profit without giving in to, in short, exploitation.</p><p>That’s not to say that it is impossible to be a genuinely “woke” artist or celebrity. One need only look at the work of Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar to see that one does not have to sacrifice strong political authority for success. Both artists deliver messages in their music that are unashamedly clear, presented not to gain anything but to spread a message regardless of any possible controversy. This is clear when Lamar spits out the words, “We hate po-po / Want to kill us dead in the street fo sho” on his acclaimed album “To Pimp a Butterfly” or when Beyoncé  wore a Black Panther-inspired outfit during the Halftime show of Super Bowl 50, thus aligning herself with the controversial Black nationalist party. White artists would do well to learn from artists such as these, reminding themselves that being “woke” is not a carefully curated persona, but ultimately a tool by which to effect change.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:51:06.734888	28	1	An analysis of how celebrities increasingly use political awareness as a means to boost their image.
140	﻿Seven Years of Ruins At Stake	seven-years-of-ruins-at-stake	<p>The image of a deceased 3-year-old, Alan Kurdni, made headlines around the world on September 25, 2015. Kurdni washed up dead on the shores of a beach after his overcrowded lifeboat, filled with hundreds of refugees, sank in the Mediterranean Sea. Kurdi and the refugees were attempting to travel to Europe to escape the Syrian civil war.</p><p>The conflict in Syria has spanned seven years and is responsible for over 465,000 deaths. After so many casualties, it is important for the international community to bring safety and closure to the Syrian people through long-term treaties, economic sanctions, and humanitarian aid.</p><p>Tensions rose between President Bashar al Assad and the Syrian people in 2011 because of Assad’s intolerance of peaceful anti-regime protests. Assad killed protesters and then began bombing cities, killing innocent civilians. Assad used chemical weapons in August of 2013 to attack Syrians in the suburbs of the capital city, Damascus.</p><p>At this point, international leaders realized that the conflict was only going to get more brutal if they did not intervene. Diplomats initially attempted to a establish a ceasefire. When that failed, they resorted to military intervention. This only escalated the conflict, making it into a proxy war: the militias found support from countries like Iran, who sent large quantities of weapons to the rebel groups in hopes that they would empower Sunni Muslims.</p><p>In addition to being a proxy war, the Syrian civil war has direct, dangerous implications for the U.S. in the form of radicalizing terrorist groups. When the conflict began in 2011, militias rebelling against the Assad regime asked for the support of the United States. The United States never responded, which radicalized rebel groups, making them see the United States as the enemy. These groups would eventually became terrorist groups, one of which is ISIS.</p><p>To find out how the international community can solve this complex issue, I interviewed David Phillips, the Director of the Program on Peace-building and Rights at Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights. Phillips has also worked as the Senior Adviser to the U.S. Department of State.</p><p>In our interview, Phillips noted that this specific conflict is complicated because the victims of oppression often become the aggressors. So, to have a peace deal, Phillips explained, “Everyone who is involved in hostility needs to have their views taken on board and there needs to be an agreement that satisfies all of those different parties.” Peace treaties in Syria should be settled in two ways: long-term treaties and short-term sanctions.</p><p>The first type of peace treaty is permanent and would end the war once and for all. However, it would take years to settle. This type of peace treaty occurs when involved parties call a ceasefire and insist on a long-term “white peace,” which requires formal authorization from the UN Security Council, affected parties, and the Syrian government.</p><p>The alternative is imposing sanctions from the UN or some external power. The militias can negotiate the terms of the sanctions with the third party. If militias don’t follow the terms of the sanctions,  the international community can sanction what is called “All Necessary Measures” under the UN Charter, which means using military force to make the militias cooperate.</p><p>Even if these methods of dividing power are effective, just ending the Syrian civil war doesn't ensure the safety of the Syrian civilians. To ensure a smooth transition to the new political systems, the international community should collaborate with organizations such as The International Center of Transitional Justice, which would hold Assad accountable through amnesty hearings. The International Rescue Committee would also participate by providing humanitarian relief for Syrian refugees settling in camps.</p><p>Ultimately, international community must care about the future of families halfway across the world. We cannot continue to have more children dying like Kurdni. The international community must decide whether it will end seven years of warfare as saviors or destroyers.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:19:55.181731	2	1	How can the international community resolve the Syrian civil war?
52	Mimbas Remain on the Prowl	mimbas-remain-on-the-prowl	<p>After splitting the first two games of the season, the Mimbas are happy but understand that they have room to improve.</p><p>As the final whistle blew in their 7-0, season-opening victory against Baruch College Campus High School, the Stuyvesant Mimbas rejoiced on the sidelines. On both ends of the field, the players did their jobs.</p><p>On defense, the Mimbas felt unchallenged throughout the game. The offense made sure that Baruch could not get open for a short goal shot, leaving the defense untaxed. They controlled the time of possession and kept the ball on Baruch’s side of the field for much of the game. Having six different scorers and seven total goals, the Mimbas showed that they were able to effectively spread the ball around to pressure their opponents on offense.</p><p>Freshman Aki Yamaguchi led the way with two goals and has been a welcome addition to the team. She has shown a potential at practice and will continue to be a force on the offense side of the ball this year and next.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl was extremely happy with the results of weeks of preseason practices and scrimmages. “We connected our passes, which is something we struggled with in the past, and communicated well,” she said.</p><p>After a close 1-0 loss to a strong Bard High School team, the Mimbas dropped a second match to Lab Museum United, 3-2. Yamaguchi and sophomore Selene Kaehny both scored for Stuyvesant in the overtime loss.</p><p>In this close bout, sophomore goalie Emory Walsh had 20 saves, doing her best to keep the team within striking distance. Her exceptional play during the first three games of the season is a pleasant surprise for a team that, at times, struggled on the defensive end last year.</p><p>Even with the two close losses, she and many of her teammates remain confident. They believe that the team has a lot to improve upon, but this start to the season has been positive.  Specifically, the defense has shown itself to be consistent so far and has given up only four goals through three games, compared to 14 during the same stretch last year.</p><p>“I think that we could've done better, but our defense played exceptionally well against their offense,” senior and co-captain Saloni Majmudar said.</p><p>If they can continue with this consistency on defense, then the old adage of defense winning games will allow the team to make another run for the playoffs after a first round exit last year. In addition, revenge against Bard High School or Lab Museum United is not out of the picture either.</p><p>“We can definitely beat them when we rematch them,” Ruhl said. They will face both teams again later in the season, so time will tell if these early losses will be avenged.</p><p>Win or lose, Coach Hugh Francis and the players take what they learn from the games and apply it to their practices. After these three games, the Mimbas have adjusted practices to mimic game situations that they need extra work on, such as throw-ins and corner kicks.</p><p>With only one game a week, the team has the luxury to correct their mistakes from these first few games and gear up for the heart of the season. This extra work combined with a new defensive intensity has given the team the belief that it can compete with anyone.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:14:30.729149	24	1	
141	﻿The Paris Climate Accord	the-paris-climate-accord	<p>While leaving the Paris Climate Accord will present short term economic benefits, its long term effects on the development of America's clean energy industry are more conspicuous.</p><p>In leaving the climate deal, Trump has ceded a portion of America's leadership of the globe and, in the words of former Secretary of State John Kerry, created a “global stain on our credibility.”</p><p>President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris Climate Deal is undoubtedly the most pivotal of his short presidency. In the long term, it could become a defining moment of not only Trump’s presidency, but American history. Trump's controversial decision to withdraw from this international agreement will define American and global politics, economics, and the fight against climate change for years to come.</p><p>One of the most immediate repercussions of leaving the climate deal is the diplomatic penalty that comes with leaving an agreement of this magnitude. In leaving, the U.S. joins Nicaragua and Syria as one of the only countries not participating in the international agreement.  Nearly every major world leader has expressed disappointment at this decision, with German chancellor Angela Merkel describing Trump's decision as “extremely regrettable” and the leader of the European council branding it a “big mistake.”</p><p>In addition to worsening​ America's international relationships, this decision will also hamper Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and American diplomatic efforts around the world. In fact, Tillerson had pressured Trump to remain in the climate deal, likely due to his knowledge of the international fallout leaving would cause.</p><p>Further confounding Tillerson is the reduced role the U.S. is now taking in the fight against climate change, leaving China and other competitors as the primary powers determining global climate policy. In leaving the climate deal, Trump has ceded a portion of America's leadership of the globe and, in the words of former Secretary of State John Kerry, created a “global stain on our credibility.”</p><p>The reaction among Americans hasn't been much different. A poll conducted by Politico found that 62 percent of Americans “wanted the U.S. to remain part of the accord.” Many American businesses, cities, and politicians have already condemned the president's decision and pledged to commit themselves to fighting climate change. In fact, a group of businesses, mayors, and governors is attempting to negotiate membership to the agreement with the UN, although they are unlikely to be accepted.</p><p>The main justification used by Trump to defend his decision is economic. There are legitimate economic consequences to abiding by the climate deal, with the Heritage Foundation estimating that it would eliminate 300,000 jobs by 2035, increase household electricity expenditures by 13 to 20 percent, and create a total loss of over 2.5 trillion dollars in GDP. Under the agreement, America had pledged to give three billion dollars to a climate fund, more than double the contribution of the second largest donor. It is understandable that Trump and many of his voters expressed grievances about these economic costs.</p><p>However, leaving the accord is somewhat economically shortsighted. Top American business leaders, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and ExxonMobil, had expressed support for the accord, arguing that remaining would encourage new investment and create jobs. In leaving the climate deal, Trump moves farther away from an economy​ powered by, and leading the world in, clean energy. The clean energy industry is growing faster than any other energy industry, currently employing over 2.5 million Americans and projected to create many more jobs as it grows. While leaving the Paris Climate Accord will present short term economic benefits, its long term effects on the development of America's clean energy industry are more conspicuous.</p><p>Of course, the entire purpose of the Paris Climate Accord was to limit the increase of global temperatures to two degrees Celsius in the next century. The two degree threshold is considered by many scientists to be the “point of no return,” or the point at which climate change will become irreversible or even catastrophic. Even with the presence​ of the climate deal, many experts had predicted that the world was still on track for over three degrees of warming over the next century.</p><p>The Paris Climate Accord has only reduced the increase in temperature by an estimated 0.2 degrees Celsius more than what had been previously projected. It lacks an enforcement mechanism in the event that a country fails to abide by its pledges. It hopes that over time countries will adopt more ambitious goals and thus further reduce global warming. Without the U.S., the world's largest carbon emitter, the success of the climate deal seems more implausible than ever.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:21:23.530683	2	1	While leaving the Paris Climate Accord will present short term economic benefits, its long term effects on the development of America's clean energy industry are...
142	﻿Passing Up PC	passing-up-pc	<p>“Political correctness” (PC) played a key role in the recent presidential election, with many people flocking in support of Donald Trump because he “says it as it is.” Others expressed revulsion toward what they viewed as comments out of place in American politics. On the other side of the political spectrum, many voters abandoned the “liberal elite” represented by Hillary Clinton after her grouping of Trump supporters into a “basket of deplorables.”</p><p>With this comment, Clinton drew the ire of many Trump supporters and strengthened their belief that their concerns toward issues such as illegal immigration were not being heard. The poor communication between voters in this past election is a side effect of the influence of political correctness on civil rhetoric in our society.</p><p>Political correctness is the deliberate avoidance of language that could offend political sensibilities. While the goal of political correctness was to protect people from hateful speech, it has created an environment adverse to the unregulated exchange of ideas and had a profound effect on freedom of speech across the U.S.</p><p>Offense is a subjective emotion, with individuals experiencing it as a result of a unique set of stimuli. What somebody is offended by depends on their beliefs, morals, and tolerance towards variance from themselves. Because there is such discrepancy in feelings of offense, it is unreasonable to restrict all potentially offensive content.</p><p>Of course, being unwilling to cede control over what ideas can be expressed is not an endorsement of discriminatory rhetoric. It is counterproductive to suppress such rhetoric, especially considering its poor outreach and unconvincing claims. The best method of defeating hateful belief systems is to allow them be expressed in the open, where their lack of productive ideas will become apparent, resulting in an almost certain public rejection.</p><p>Recently, students at Columbia University demanded the removal of a statue of Thomas Jefferson from campus because they took offense to it as a “symbol of violence against black and brown bodies.” These students’ determination to protect the feelings of marginalized groups has caused them to protest for the removal of a statue of a founding father, a symbol of our nation.  These protests constitute an act of censorship.</p><p>Similarly, the job of policing speech often falls into society's hands. Forbes details some methods used to enforce political correctness, ranging from UK colleges banning clapping because it could “trigger anxiety” to a safe-space room founded in Brown University for attendees who “might find debate upsetting.”</p><p>In today's heated political environment, the unrestricted exchange of ideas has become more important than ever. Open discussion allows both ends of the political spectrum a voice, resulting in more inclusive solutions to issues. When the free marketplace of ideas is shut down as it is on college campuses, this mutually beneficial exchange of ideas does not occur. Instead, the political climate becomes more polarized as individuals are drawn to political echo chambers where their beliefs are not only unchallenged, but confirmed.</p><p>The complexity of this notion deepens with subjectivity. Some may claim that without the presence of PC culture, the abstract concept of “freedom” is granted to some but taken away from those aggrieved by so-called hate speech. An open-letter written by a protester furthered that "people talk a lot about 'freedom of speech' and I think this fetish of speech misses the larger point. It is about… who has it, and who is denied it."</p><p>The implementation of PC culture into our society, however, is not a valid solution for eradicating hate speech. Throwing around labels such as “racist” or “sexist” without merit only serves to discredits instances in which their usage would be appropriate--accusations alone could effectively ruin a career. Crying wolf  in the name of political correctness has made it impossible for anyone, in fear of being labelled a “bigot,” to speak out, causing careful tiptoeing around the topic of diversity, or even an avoidance all together. A further constriction on “offensive” speech would not be conducive to a socially just society: rather, it would make it even harder to fight for these causes.</p><p>Stuyvesant, in contrast, boasts a room where profound discourse bounces off trophy-lined walls. With a variety of extracurriculars like debate teams, Young Democrats, the Intellectual  Conservative Society, and The Spectator, a diversity of opinion remains a crucial attribute of our student body. Heated arguments can be heard in the hallways or followed intently on lengthy Facebook comment chains. If a statement is made with malicious intent, it is discredited through intellectual discussion. If an unpopular opinion resonates with a minority, it is heeded—if not fiercely debated—by the rest as a legitimate stance on an issue.</p><p>This attitude is one that needs to be encouraged within youth. PC culture is the barrier between the American people and the freedom of expression. It is unacceptable for it to be fostered in a society, especially one which predicates itself on the latter. As Frederick Douglas once noted, “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.” This philosophy, while a rather old one, grounds the existence of civil discourse. It's certainly not time to forsake it.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:22:31.947842	2	1	The unattainable goal that political correctness seeks to achieve has resulted in more stringent limitations on individual freedom, including restrictive speech codes banning words such as “sportsmanship.”
147	﻿Harry Styles: A New Era	harry-styles-a-new-era	<p>“Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times / Welcome to the final show / Hope you’re wearing your best clothes.” These are the first lines that Harry Styles sings in his solo debut single, “Sign of the Times,” which was released on April 7, 2017. These lyrics hold powerful and passionate emotions—things that the general public may not have expected a member of One Direction to be capable of.</p><p>One Direction members Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Harry Styles decided to take a hiatus over a year ago. With promises to come back soon, they have been working on solo projects, and Styles is no exception, having decided to take a different approach to music.</p><p>In One Direction, Styles was known as the frontman, singing most of the solos and carrying the chorus. However, he did not write many of the songs and did not have a lot of control over the types of songs he was allowed to sing.</p><p>One Direction’s style in their earlier years fits more of a stereotypical boy band, with most of their songs about young love and relationships. Their music style became more mature beginning with their third album, “Midnight Memories,” which contains some rock elements, but was still predominantly pop.</p><p>However, Styles’s new type of music has no traces of pop music. He released his solo debut album “Harry Styles,” which features 10 songs, including soft ballads like “Two Ghosts” and hard rock anthems like “Kiwi,” on May 19, 2017. As entertainment journal “Variety” describes his album: “[It’s] rock and it’s roll, but it’s also soft and sensitive.”</p><p>When asked about the versatility of his tracks, Styles replied, “I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that instead of picking a sound and writing 10 of the same things.”</p><p>The self-titled album may have very different songs, but they all have one thing in common: they include Styles pouring out all his feelings.</p><p>In one of his slower songs “Meet Me in the Hallway,” he sings, “Just let me know, I’ll be at the door, at the door / Hoping you’ll come around / Just let me know I’ll be on the floor, on the floor / Maybe we’ll work it out / I gotta get better, gotta get better.”</p><p>Styles croons about still wanting someone to return, even when he has been hurt by the person before. It has a very pretty and light tone and sounds perfect for a choir to sing. This song has a Pink Floyd vibe to it, especially when compared to the song, “Breathe (In the Air).” Both songs are very sweet-sounding, and both David Gilmour and Harry Styles stretch out the lyrics to make the words sound like echoes.</p><p>Another song that stands out from the album is Styles’s debut single “Sign of the Times,” which is commonly described as a bold choice. It’s unusual for a five-minute rock song about dying and the end of a life to debut at number one on the iTunes charts. The song starts off with slow and mellow piano chords, but sharply changes when there is a dramatic drumming to a full-on rock reverie.</p><p>Styles doesn’t disappoint with his vocals either. In the last minute of the song, he holds out long notes and hits the high notes with ease as he repeats, “We got to get away, we got to get away,” and “We got to, we got to run” various times. He also uses a falsetto in the pre-chorus, which he sings effortlessly.</p><p>“Sign of the Times” definitely has a David Bowie feel to it, made clear with the choir, the guitar sound, the space theme, and the cabaret atmosphere. Bowie is known for his galactic, science fantasy feel to his music; one of his most famous albums, “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,” actually centers around an alien who is also a rock-n-roll superstar. Styles mimics this quality with the use of guitars and drums to set the atmosphere for a space-y rock ballad.</p><p>In fact, most of Styles’s album seems to be inspired by the British rock star. His song “Only Angel” begins with a soft and instrumental tune that lasts for a minute until the atmosphere rockets to rock with Styles screaming “HEY! HEY!” This is quite similar to one of Bowie’s most famous songs, “Life On Mars?” with the dramatic change of mood in the song and the use of background singers.</p><p>Not all of Styles’s songs on this album are packed full with emotions and poignancy though. In “Kiwi,” he shows that he can have a fun time and let loose when he screams, “Oh, I think she said ‘I’m having your baby, it’s none of your business,’” multiple times. This song is surely a song to blast out from your speakers on a weekend night to displease your parents. It’s very upbeat and energetic, stocked with guitar riffs and intense drumming that will make you want to scream along to Styles.</p><p>In Styles’s debut solo album, he breaks out of his shell, both lyrically and musically. The boy-band superstar has matured and is now playing with his limits and exploring new types of music with the help of inspirations like Pink Floyd and David Bowie.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:27:23.116579	16	1	Harry Styles breaks away from his boy band roots and draws inspiration from ‘70s British rock in his debut album.
150	﻿Riverdale: The New Breakfast Club	riverdale-the-new-breakfast-club	<p>Now that “Riverdale” is officially on Netflix, it is the perfect television show to binge-watch, whether you're procrastinating or just browsing. Adapted from the “Archie Comics,” “Riverdale” takes a dark, offbeat reimagining of the popular series. The new teen drama immerses itself in the eerie mystery of Jason Blossom’s (Trevor Stines) murder. It has all of the desirable elements of a teenage drama—a striking cast, high school stereotypes, (scandalous) romantic relations, social pressure, and popular trends—without being too corny.</p><p>The heart of “Riverdale” lies within the cast: Archie (KJ Apa), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Jughead (Cole Sprouse), and Veronica (Camila Mendes). “Riverdale” spins the classic whodunit mystery into a compelling coming-of-age narrative. These quippy teenagers confront the somber calling of the adult world. Entangled in the adults’ thick web of lies, they unravel the truth thread by thread.</p><p>The television series chucks away the comic’s old cliches for a noir Breakfast Club meets “Riverdale” ambience. Older readers of the “Archie Comics” would blush at this radical reimagining of their beloved classic. This new Archiverse is filled with not only shadings of incest and inappropriate student-teacher relationships, but a web of corruption from embezzlement to drug dealings.</p><p>As the comic book title suggests, “Archie Comics” centers around the typical all-American boy Archibald “Archie” Andrews. The comic’s main plot line consists of Archie chasing after Betty and Veronica. The love triangle is present in almost every digest and double digest. There are sometimes additional love interests, like Cheryl Blossom and Valerie Smith. The comics focus on Archie grabbing lunch, going to the beach, ogling at other girls, and other typical teenage outings.</p><p>“Riverdale” transformed the Archiverse’s plot beyond the gang’s innocent small-town shenanigans. They took the comic’s famous landmark, Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe and turned it into a more sinister-looking diner where the teens not only bond together, but discover the town’s grim secrets. In both “Riverdale” and the comics, Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe serves as a center of civic life for the teens to foster their friendships.</p><p>The meaningful friendships give the audience the impression that the cast members are real and dynamic characters. For instance, in the show, Archie and Jughead’s brotherhood creates a heartfelt response. Impressively, “Riverdale” creates another unexpected dynamic duo. In the comics, Betty and Veronica were eternal rivals for Archie’s love. Fortunately, “Riverdale” steps away from this stereotypical trope, and instead makes Betty the sugar to Veronica’s spice. This notion is revealed through several different scenes, in which they work together to achieve common goals. Their feminist approach is conveyed as they attack the controversial issue of victim-blaming; in one episode, they led a group of victimized girls to expose the football team who objectified hem.</p><p>No worries if you didn't read the comics though, because the plot is simply too good to pass up. From the same network that produced “Gossip Girl” and “Vampire Diaries,” you're bound to fall in love with the characters and their dilemmas. Much like with “Gossip Girl” and “Vampire Diaries,” there are also major similarities between “Riverdale” and “Twin Peaks” as well as “Pretty Little Liars”; the pilot episode starts off with the popular kid being missing and the whole town being shaken by it. Not only that, but it is filled with redheads, which is pretty rare in the showbiz.</p><p>The cast is pretty dreamy, from nostalgic ‘90s stars to rising actors and actresses. These ‘90s stars include Luke Perry, Mädchen Amick, Casey Cott, and Molly Ringwald, all of whom are parents to the main characters. Rising actresses include Camila Mendes, Lili Reinhart, Madelaine Petsch, Shannon Purser, and Ross Butler. Cole Sprouse is also reintroduced to the showbiz, as he debuts as Jughead in this series. Some of the rising actors and actresses are relatively underrated and use this chance to introduce themselves to the media. Nonetheless, there is great chemistry between all of the actors and actresses on stage. Like Cole Sprouse said, “We all showed up on set and it was magic. As a cast, we get along like peas in pods.”</p><p>As the comics were written in the late ‘30s, CW made changes to create an adaptation that diversified the cast. Josie and the Pussycats was an all-girl rock band featured in “Archie Comics”; two-thirds of them were white in the comics, but all of them are black in the television show. Reggie Mantle was a sarcastic womanizing jock, who was also white in the comics, but with Ross Butler casted as this character, he is breaking Asian stereotypes and giving Asians the representation they deserve. The LGBTQ+ community is also represented as well—in the comics and in the TV show—with Kevin Keller as the first openly gay character. Though Kevin is seen as the “gay best friend” archetype throughout the TV show, he also plays a critical role in the development of the plot. Like the other straight main characters, his romances are caught in the adults’ lies, thus normalizing his gay sexuality. Though there have been many changes made to “Archie Comics,” “Riverdale” is definitely more inclusive of underrepresented groups, forming connections between its characters and audience.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:33:09.216265	17	1	“Riverdale,” a television series adapted from “Archie Comics,” is refreshing as it was modified to be diversified; it has all of the desirable elements of a teenage drama without being too corny.
151	﻿A Movie As Confusing and Glorious As Its Name	a-movie-as-confusing-and-glorious-as-its-name	<p>“I can’t believe it.” These are a few of only several dozen words that our protagonist, later to be known as Buster (Rami Malek), utters, and they perfectly summarize the despair the movie summons as a backdrop for its audience.</p><p>In the first few moments of the 2017 film, “Buster’s Mal Heart,” we see the identical silhouettes of two men sitting in a small boat with a backdrop of the sun and a glimmering sea. At this time, the identities of both are a mystery and they look more like small toys than actual people. The scene cuts to the roar of a gunshot and a panicked Buster running for his life in what appears to be a remote, mountainous region.</p><p>“Buster’s Mal Heart” follows the growing illusions of Jonah (Rami Malek), a family man who works as a night shift hotel concierge. We see him going through the cycles of someone who can barely keep himself together. He struggles to make money in his “dead-end job,” but constantly reminds his wife of their—or rather his—dream to get a farm and live off the land. He is quiet, resolute, and harbors the need of a wild spirit trying to break free of the traditional boundaries given to him.</p><p>The movie switches between this and the endeavors of Buster, also played by Rami Malek, to avoid a crew of considerably simple-minded, watered-down versions of state troopers while trying to spread the word about the oncoming Y2K, the prophesied end of the world.</p><p>Buster is the exact opposite of Jonah. He is boisterous and leaves reminders of his presence in the way that an animal would. He randomly calls radio talk shows and live psychic readings, trying to convince people that “the Inversion is coming.”</p><p>For the second time in five minutes, the title of the movie is shown with its inverted text. The reflection of the title is not a random choice of fun text effects. It’s a revelation to the fact that the movie will constantly be presenting viewers with two dark and different realities.</p><p>At first, the film is confusing. We aren’t presented with much information to start with, and at the end of it all, there still isn’t a lot of extra context. There is instead a strong preference to “show” and not “tell,” forcing viewers to play a psychological mind game to piece together the various gaps in the storyline, such as, “Who is Buster? What does he want? Why does he always look like a deer in the headlights? And what’s with his obsession with adult onesies?”</p><p>A profound set of events that changes Jonah’s life and possibly turns him into Buster the mountain man is scattered in bits and pieces throughout the film. During early scenes of Jonah in his night shift as a hotel concierge, we see him watching a sketchy, pixelated screen of an aging scientist yelling that “the Inversion is coming!” This alludes to the aforementioned Y2K, or Year 2000 bug.</p><p>At the crack of dawn, a tall stranger comes into the hotel asking for a room. Jonah is suspicious as he has no existing I.D. at all and carries a bag full of a questionable white substance. Jonah asks for a name but never gets one. The only reference to this tall stranger is “the Last Free Man” (DJ Qualls). The LFM is already irritating Jonah with his shady appearance and lack of clarity, but insists on telling Jonah about his quest as an “exterminator of glitches.” He fixes them and makes them go away.</p><p>The appearance of the LFM marks the beginning of Jonah’s deterioration as the life-altering events that follow drive him to insanity.</p><p>The movie is not afraid to delve into the most violent recesses of the conscious mind. It addresses the dark side of human nature in the way Buster immerses himself in his quest to escape the end of the world. Jonah emphasizes what it means to carry out thoughts that many wouldn’t think to perform, such as the accidental murder of his wife and child.</p><p>The film portrays the concept of darkness as a mentally changeable substance that allows for activities such as locking people in their basements and pretending to be someone who is long dead to become daily occurrences.</p><p>However, this movie tries to be unbiased when it comes to giving the audience members free reign over what they want to think. We see Jonah talking to his daughter affectionately and Buster gently feeding an elderly couple, who are held hostage, in their mountain home.</p><p>We receive seemingly intertwined events occurring in the lives of Jonah and Buster, convincing us that they are one and the same, but suddenly, we are not so sure when confronting Buster’s rebellious and sometimes rude attitude, which contrasts with Jonah’s well-meaning and comforting tones.</p><p>Everything from Jonah’s encounter with “the Last Free Man” to Buster’s uncanny patience, control, and transformation of self in his search for the meaning of his beliefs gives the audience thinking space.</p><p>We are allowed to conceive an appropriate identity for two men, or perhaps only one, that goes against the will of a perceived god and universe. We learn that Buster’s journey is not about him running away from what he did, but rather his quest for the meaning of his life. We are forced to ask questions that can help us define the Buster we know in this movie.</p><p>Jonah thinks it’s fine for his daughter to watch slightly age-inappropriate cartoons, so we must ask more questions to understand what contributes to such odd fatherly moments as this and what led to his eventual collapse.</p><p>With a movie that favors dark, overpowering tones and a sweeping narrative to carry almost unrelated details of its main characters to light, this film makes for a strange but exhilarating ride.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:33:56.096317	13	1	Buster’s Mal Heart chronicles the almost psychedelic overtones of two men in their journeys to discover their true selves.
152	﻿Art on the Streets	art-on-the-streets	<p>A biannual outdoor art show, the Washington Square Art Exhibit, has been around for more than 80 years. It all started in 1931, during the Great Depression, when a few local artists decided to showcase and hopefully sell some of their work. The founder, Jackson Pollock, desperately in need of funds to pay the rent for a studio in Greenwich Village, took a few of his paintings and set them up on the sidewalks near Washington Square Park. He was soon joined by fellow village artists in the same financial situation.</p><p>After a while, the crowd of artists grew, attracting more and more passersby to stop and look. Many of their works were purchased, and the event was even noted by luminaries of the art world such as Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the Whitney Museum of Art, and Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Director of the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>As the years went by, what began as a small fair evolved into a massive exhibit featuring artists from all over the world. Artists from New York, New Jersey, Washington D.C, and even China gathered to put together an impressive show. As of today, the exhibit takes place every Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend, on the sidewalks of University Place from East 13th Street south to Waverly Place. It is now a showcase of art from diverse backgrounds, where people can be exposed to the diversity of art forms and where artists can be rewarded for their outstanding pieces. The exhibit didn’t lose its original purpose either, since artists whose works have been selected by judges can still receive cash prizes, donated by individuals, in support of their work.</p><p>The most recent exhibit this past Memorial day started at around noon. The sidewalks around Washington Square Park were encompassed in a casual, lighthearted atmosphere. The seven to eight blocks were filled with small, white booths displaying works of the exhibitor, some of which even played music.</p><p>Being open to the public, the exhibit attracted a wide range of audiences, varying from students to parents and children to the elderly. As the viewers walked down the neatly decorated blocks, they could admire the artworks, purchase souvenirs, and even chat with the artists about their work. Regardless of whether the viewers have been exposed to much art, many of them appreciated this opportunity to see and experience such a diverse range of pieces.</p><p>The artworks showcased came from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, as the artists themselves come from around the world. There were realist, impressionist, and cubist paintings, depicting scenes from nature and scenery to skyscrapers and city life. One piece showed the Brooklyn Bridge with the rough strokes on the water resembling Claude Monet’s “Sunrise.” And while paintings of New York City were the most common, each represented a different style, a different way of viewing the city. Some portrayed the place as a busy commercial center while others emphasized its beauty and harmony.</p><p>Other paintings expressed abstract ideas, which the artists further developed as they explained their work to the viewers. Unlike traditional museums, the artists stayed by their artworks to discuss their inspirations, life experiences, and what pushed them to create their art pieces. Many viewers found it was interesting how what could have seemed like patches of color could mean something so much more after considering the artist’s perspective.</p><p>Aside from paintings, the exhibit also incorporated photography and handcrafts into the already diverse art forms, adding variety to the event. Photographs featured landscape and environment as well as people and urban settings, while handcrafts included sculptures, jewelry, clocks, and handkerchiefs.</p><p>With its unique charm, the Washington Square Art Exhibit stands out even in a busy city like New York. The diversity of the art it incorporates helps it appeal to a wide range of people. The event promotes art as a facet of the city’s culture and allows city dwellers to become more aware of the art around them. It wins the applause of many citizens, which continues to drive the event as it progresses with each passing year.</p><p>[a]i put the 'so what'/'why does it matter' part in the conclusion i hope thats okay :)</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:34:46.898874	4	1	An outdoor exhibit draws the crowds near Washington Square Park.
155	﻿From a '30s Shoe Store to a Warm Candy Haven: The Legacy of Economy Candy	from-a-30s-shoe-store-to-a-warm-candy-haven-the-legacy-of-economy-candy	<p>If you’re anything like me, one of the things that you cherish about New York City is the variety of little, family-run shops that practically dominate—or at least used to dominate—the city. Sometimes we forget that these shops have real, hardworking people and a rich history behind them.</p><p>One of my favorite places in the entire city lies in the heart of one of the most historic parts of the city: the Lower East Side. At 108 Rivington Street stands the now 80-year-old candy store, Economy Candy. Packed to the ceiling with virtually every type of sugary treat from the classic chocolate bars to the myriad of jelly bean machines at the back of the shop, it delivers a bit of a sensory overload when walking in.</p><p>The atmosphere is an immediate time warp. It’s nothing like many candy stores of today, which have neon walls, bright colors everywhere, and glass cases (like Dylan’s Candy Bar or Itsugar). Rather, entering Economy Candy is like walking into a small mom-and-pop shop crowded with candies in boxes hastily put on tables and shelves. These boxes are everywhere, packed up to the ceiling and all the way to the very back of the store, making it seem as if the entire store itself is made of candy.</p><p>I knew that this little gem of a place must have a rich history as I had heard that it had been around for a while. After a quick chat with the friendly owner Mitchell Cohen, the original owner’s grandson, I found that the store has been around since 1937 and was originally a shoe store. He recounts, “Well, we used to be on the corner [of] Essex Street, and it was a shoe store. During the war, we used to get candy and sell it; it oversold the shoes and we decided, ‘Why not make this a candy store?’”</p><p>Like any store that has been around for a substantial length of time, the store has evolved with the area. Cohen recalled, “You know, in the ‘60s and ‘70s, it was really bad down here. The Lower East Side was a drug haven [with] bars; we’d close shop and look both ways to make sure we wouldn’t get mugged, you know? [There was a lot] of thievery; it wasn’t a good neighborhood.” He smiled and said, “But we held out and it got better, and look where we are now. We were at a low point and now we’re at the high [point].”</p><p>Economy Candy is the cornerstone of a cute family business. From its vast collection of familiar and rare candies to its bubbly ambiance, it has everything a kid (or an adult) could possibly dream of. It’s a historic landmark that everyone can enjoy.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:37:07.569578	14	1	A little look into the famous mom-and-pop candy shop Economy Candy.
30	Conference Days are Back at Stuyvesant	conference-days-are-back-at-stuyvesant	<p>Conference days will be held on Mondays for teachers and administrative staff to engage in professional development starting on October 2. The conference day schedule includes periods that are four minutes shorter, with classes ending at 2:46 p.m. to make time for the meeting.</p><p>These days will allow teachers and assistant principals of different departments to meet for 40 minutes to discussing topics related to their content area, such as how to teach a specific unit, or how to get resources for a certain lab. The assistant principal will lead the conference, but the role can be transferred to teachers want to share something with rest of the department.</p><p>It is mandatory for the teachers to attend the conference days, and they won’t be getting additional hours or paid. “[Conference days] are part of the contract [...] which allows the school to administer it a maximum of twice a month,” Principal Eric Contreras said.</p><p>Teachers will also meet in smaller groups twice a month. “We are also keeping two Mondays for when teachers will come together in smaller pockets throughout the day for administrational and instructional sharing [throughout] departments,” Contreras said.</p><p>Former principal Stanley Teitel instituted conference days, as well. However, former principal Jie Zhang discontinued them.</p><p>Several teachers have expressed their approval of conference days to Contreras. “I am totally relieved and appreciative [about conference days]. It's been frustrating to have only a couple of non-school days when my whole department comes together,” Assistant Principal of English Eric Grossman said. “It's really valuable for us to set around the table together and talk as a department. Meeting in much smaller groups as we have done for the past few years, while there is some value in that, what it means is that it's much harder for everybody to hear from everybody else, work on things together, and agree on things together.”</p><p>Contreras hopes that bringing back conference days will push Stuyvesant forward. “We need to have conversations and listen to each other at all levels, but I do believe in modeling the work so if we want things to be innovative and collaborative at a student level, than we must do it at the adult level,” he said.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:54:57.36251	1	1	Conference days are being held once a month for teachers and administrative staff to engage in professional development.
31	﻿Free School Available for All NYC Public School Students	free-school-available-for-all-nyc-public-school-students	<p>School lunch is now free for all New York City public school students. The policy, Free Lunch for All, was announced by Chancellor Carmen Farina on September 6.</p><p>Historically, free lunch was provided for 75 percent of public school students based on family income. The purpose of the new policy is to eliminate the stigma against students who receive free lunch.</p><p>Lunch previously cost $2.25 for students who had to pay full price. However, Free Lunch for All is not expected to cost New York City more. Due to changes in how the city collects data on needy families, the city recently qualified for a federal program that will compensate for Free Lunch for All.</p><p>Though this change means each family’s income is irrelevant to qualify for free or reduced lunch, it is still important for families to complete the School Meals Form distributed to students during homeroom. The income data from these forms is needed in order to appropriately distribute funding as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides financial assistance to schools with high percentages of low-income students, such as Stuyvesant.</p><p>Some believe the policy will not have a large effect on Stuyvesant. In a survey distributed online by The Spectator, 32.3 percent of respondents (151 students) answered that the new policy would have no effect on them. “I don’t really care about whether school lunch is free or not. I eat lunch outside anyway,” junior Francis Park said.</p><p>However, 33.1 percent of respondents (155 students) expect to eat school lunch more regularly, and 34.4 percent of respondents (161 students) already eat school lunch frequently.</p><p>Principal Eric Contreras views the change positively. “When students come to Stuy[vesant], I want their main focus to be on their academics and their success in and out of the classroom,” Contreras said. “Having a healthy nutritious lunch is an important thing for all students, and at Stuyvesant, for students to spend sometimes 10 hours every day here, making sure that they're not hungry while they’re in class or in club [meetings] or [during] sports team [practices] is really key for me.”</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 01:55:25.267448	1	1	Free lunch available at Stuyvesant from a student’s perspective
44	﻿What It Means to Be Beautiful	what-it-means-to-be-beautiful	<p>The Stereotype of Beauty</p><p>“With a smile and a song / life is just a bright sunny day / your cares fade away,” Snow White croons to some blue jays in the midst of a forest. Many recognize Snow White as a nostalgic representation of beauty, with her pale skin and delicate voice. The classic story of Snow White is that her stepmother is jealous of her youthful beauty. Her stepmother proceeds to brew a poisonous apple and tricks her into eating it, causing Snow White to fall into a coma. However, a prince, shocked by her beauty, falls in love with Snow White and kisses her, which subsequently revives her.</p><p>Most children hear this classical story at some point in their childhood, or at least read or watched an adaptation of the story. These children get the message that beauty is associated with being a damsel in distress and that a man must come and save her to be the hero. This idea of a “damsel in distress” has been used in many action movies, where female characters appear to only be the love interest of the male hero and are often saved by the male hero.</p><p>Another stereotype that I remember vividly was that to be beautiful, you had to be blonde, blue-eyed, pale-skinned, female, and thin. Most of the main actresses in movies fit these stereotypes. I recall staring up at my television screen, watching the Oscars with my parents and seeing the nominations for Best Actress; most of them were blonde and white. My young mind thought that I, as an Asian American with brown eyes and black hair, could never be as beautiful as them.</p><p>A New Direction</p><p>A controversy last year surrounded the Oscar nominees, as if in direct response to my dilemma. The problem was that all 20 of the Oscar nominees in the main four categories (best actress, best actor, best actress in a supporting role, and best actor in a supporting role) were white. Fire erupted on social media under the tag “#OscarsSoWhite,” and many activists and celebrities chose not to go to the Oscars in response to the controversy. This lack of diversity was noticeably absent in the most recent Oscars.</p><p>In recent times, the tides have shifted. Many companies and activists are stepping up to be more inclusive, provide more diverse role models for young children, and boost the self esteem of women.</p><p>Disney has been proactive with the issue, creating diverse princesses for their movies. I grew up looking up to Mulan. She was not only beautiful, with flowing black hair just like I have, but was also tough and persevering. Nowadays, we have an even more diverse cast of Disney princesses: Jasmine (1992), Mulan (1995), Pocahontas (1995), Tiana (2009), Merida (2012), and most recently, Moana (2016).</p><p>But Disney was not the only company that changed. After 57 years of controversy, Mattel, the creator of the famous (and infamous) Barbie doll, finally gave in to the diversifying meaning of “beauty” and gave her a makeover because she had been promoting the stereotypical blonde-hair, stick-thin ideal of beauty. Over the years, many girls have been affected by this unrealistic body image and have tried to change themselves to look more like the Barbie doll in order to be “beautiful.” Mattel introduced a new line of Barbie dolls with three different body types: tall, petite, and curvy, coming from many ethnic backgrounds and with different styles of hair.</p><p>The old stereotype of beauty is out, and a new, more diverse image has been introduced: “All women are beautiful, no matter what skin color or body type they have.”</p><p>Heading Forward</p><p>We’ve come far, but it doesn’t mean media representation of beauty is perfect. Models in fashion magazines are still predominantly unnaturally thin and tall, and this has led to body image issues for many young girls who want to be as beautiful as they are. A social media trend of having a “thigh gap” has become increasingly popular, despite many people not having a body type capable of having a thigh gap. Even with the increased representation of beautiful women from minority backgrounds, there is still a disproportionately high representation of white women as being beautiful.</p><p>A core problem with beauty and its representation in media is that LGBTQ+ people are severely underrepresented. I, myself, identify as LGBTQ+, so it really upset me that there was a lack of role models that helped me be comfortable with myself and my identity. For example, there are very few transgender role models for transgender children to look up to.</p><p>Also, I often felt left out when someone said that “all women are beautiful” because as a young boy, I always wanted to be graceful, elegant, and beautiful. As I grew up, I became uncomfortable with my body image because no one would tell me that even though I was a boy, I was beautiful too. Watching television, I would see countless advertisements for makeup companies, and I would never see any guys.</p><p>I would spend countless hours staring at the mirror with discomfort and dissatisfaction. Sometimes I would be overwhelmed by emotion, and my eyes would dampen. My body image issues (along with other identity problems at the time) eventually took a toll on my confidence and self esteem to the point where I was very shy around people I didn’t know very well or trust as a friend. Thankfully, I overcame my insecurities when I came to Stuyvesant, knowing that at least some people would accept me for who I am.</p><p>Because of this, I always hope that someday the saying “all women are beautiful” will eventually become “all people are beautiful.” I hope that all children, whether they are female, male, or non-binary, know that they are beautiful and that the societal standard of beauty is simply unrealistic.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:52:56.522722	28	1	Summarize the focus of the story in one sentence
38	﻿Undocumented at Stuyvesant	undocumented-at-stuyvesant	<p>Stuyvesant has long been known to have an exceptionally large immigrant student population. A recent survey done by the Spectator revealed that approximately 74 percent of the current freshman class is either an immigrant or a child of immigrants. This makes our current political climate particularly sensitive for Stuyvesant students, especially in light of all of the rhetoric against immigration by the Trump administration. Unfortunately, this negative attention has silenced many students. The truth is that an issue that affects one student in our school affects us all.</p><p>What is DACA and who are the DREAMers?</p><p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an American immigration policy proposed by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It is designed to help immigrant children who arrived in the United States illegally by protecting them from deportation and providing a work permit for two years. In order to qualify for DACA, immigrants must have entered the U.S. before their sixteenth birthday and lived here since, be a student or high school graduate, and remain in good legal standing. DACA does not provide an opportunity for citizenship or any sort of federal funding/welfare.</p><p>As of 2017, around 800,000 immigrants are protected by the program. These immigrants are also known as DREAMers, named after the DREAM Act bill first introduced in the Senate in 2001. This Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act was a proposal for a process that would grant immigrant minors conditional residency in the U.S. for six years. Following graduation from an institution of higher education or service in the military, and a demonstration of good moral character, immigrants would be able to apply for permanent residency. Though this bill was estimated to benefit over two million immigrants, it failed to pass in the Senate. Immigrants under DACA (which was passed, in part, as a response of the failure of the DREAM act) were coined DREAMers.</p><p>Why is DACA so controversial?</p><p>Those who oppose DACA claim that allowing immigrants with a deferred status to stay would transfer valuable resources, time, and money away from legal residents. This includes services such as health care, education, and even printing driver’s licenses. However, this concern turns out to be unfounded. By purchasing cars and homes and starting their own businesses, DACA recipients end up pouring revenue back into the states. On another note, many Republican leaders see the DACA program as Obama overstepping his executive power, since the policy did not go through Congress.</p><p>What does Trump have to do with DACA?</p><p>Following an extreme anti-immigration stance during his campaign and pressure from Republicans to rescind DACA, President Trump ended the program at the beginning of the month. No new applications are being accepted, and those who are currently under protection risk deportation starting March 2018. Trump did, however, pass off the responsibility of protecting the DREAMers off to Congress, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!” This provides hope that legislation will be able to recover some of these protections.</p><p>What rights do undocumented immigrants have?</p><p>Undocumented immigrants are entitled to the same basic Constitutional rights as citizens. However, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver’s licenses in most states, nor can they vote or receive financial aid for college.</p><p>But all immigrants — documented are not — are entitled to be treated the same as citizens in our country are. They deserve our respect, kindness, and sympathy. Though as high school students, it is not in our power to pass legislation that will soften the stigma against these people, we should take it upon ourselves to speak out against misinformed stereotypes and treat all people with empathy and respect.</p><p>Interview</p><p>To humanize Stuyvesant’s undocumented community, we sent out a form to solicit anonymous interviews. This was the only response we received, which speaks to the precariousness of these students’ situation.</p><p>What is your current immigration status?</p><p>My parents came as foreign students and we got the [...] visa for it and if my parents get the visa then their children get the visa automatically. The visa got expired because my parents couldn’t afford to go to school and that’s why we’re currently undocumented.</p><p>Are you currently under DACA?</p><p>I came to America in 2011, so I’m not qualified for DACA.</p><p>Did you always know your status?</p><p>Yeah. Mostly because my parents cannot speak English that well, and I was the one who had to translate all the documents for them. Also, I’m the oldest person among the siblings and I have to take care of everything.</p><p>Why did you come to the U.S.?</p><p>The direct reason we came to America was because my dad was having a business and it didn’t go well and [he] was seeking new opportunity in a new land. In the long term, it would be for our education (for me and my siblings)...Since I’m undocumented now I don’t know if it that will happen.</p><p>What was your personal experience adjusting to the US?</p><p>I was really nervous on the first day of school. I did not understand half of the words my teacher and friends were saying. I went to a school in [another state] first and my friends there were really nice and were really friendly to me and were trying to get me to adjust to a new way of life. But then I moved to a new town and had to go to a new school, which was a lot harsher for me because people there were less friendly. There were a lot of times I would stay by myself during lunch. It was kind of hard…  I moved to New York after one year in [another state]. I still remember the last day of school before moving to new York – I was on the school bus and there was this girl who was sitting in the back and … she yelled “I'm glad she's going” and I was sad.</p><p>How does the current political situation concerning immigration affect you?</p><p>DACA was the one way I could get a job and travel outside of America. If DACA still existed, they could have updated the year when you could come. Right now, you could get DACA only if you immigrated before 2008.</p><p>What is your opinion on the removal of DACA and the current political situation?</p><p>As the undocumented, we pay close attention to news about immigration and law changes, and  I was paying attention to election day. I personally didn’t believe Trump would be president, and  it was kind of like the end of the world I guess. I mean, that’s why I believe if Clinton became president it could have been better for us, even I could eventually gain citizenship I could at least hope of getting DACA and there is no hope for me right now to live in America. I’m trying to go to college but there's no way for me to afford it unless I become a citizen or at least a permanent resident. So that’s what I'm stressed about right now.</p><p>How do you feel at Stuyvesant as an undocumented immigrant?</p><p>It’s more diverse and more accepting. And I bet most people at Stuy don't like Trump. But I feel like there’s still a subtle tension that if I confront that I’m undocumented they would see me differently. This actually happened two days ago… Something came up and most of my friends knew I didn't get my citizenship yet and one of my friends actually asked, are you undocumented? And I guess I lied that I have green card and that wasn’t the first time I was asked that question and that’s usually how I get through those questions. Some of my closest friends knew I was undocumented but they didn’t really see me differently and they said they would try to help but I don’t know how they could help me… I talked to my guidance counselor about it and she was really accepting and she showed me a way: there’s a thing call BOLS – it’s volunteers of legal service, they provide lawyers to consult with undocumented people of how they can find a way to get out of their status. And my guidance counselor was really helpful and I actually went to the office and I met one of the lawyers and we talked about it and she was trying to help me but she said there's no way we can help you at this moment because of the laws and the status that I'm in.The biggest concern I have right now is trying to get to college. Undocumented people cannot have FAFSA or financial aid so that's why I have to talk to my Guidance Counselor more and with my College Counselor more.</p><p>Final statements</p><p>I just want to say that it can be anyone: your neighbors, the cashier you meet in your grocery store... To the undocumented people I want to say that I felt like I  was alone, that our family was the only one that was struggling with this problem, [but] now that a lot of people are standing up because of the extermination of DACA I have more hope for it and hopefully I can gain my way through college and eventually [get] a job and [settle] better in America because that's the whole reason I came to America.</p><p>Resources for Undocumented Students</p><p>https://www.ilrc.org/living-united-states-guide-immigrant-youth</p><p>https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/focus/immigration-resources.html</p><p>For college applicants: http://www.onlinecolleges.net/for-students/undocumented-student-college-guide/</p><p>Undocumented Youth Led Organization in NYC:https://www.nysylc.org/what-we-do/</p><p>Resources: https://www.nysylc.org/college-info/</p><p>[a]</p><p>[a]This can be moved online.

A recent survey done by the Spectator revealed that approximately 74 percent of the current freshman class is either an immigrant or a child of immigrants. This makes our current political climate particularly sensitive for Stuyvesant students, especially in light of all of the rhetoric against immigration by the Trump administration. Unfortunately, this negative attention has silenced many students. The truth is that an issue that affects one student in our school affects us all.
41	﻿NYC Food Hall of Fame	nyc-food-hall-of-fame	<p>Chelsea Market opened its doors to thousands of hungry New Yorkers of wildly different backgrounds and tastes in food in 1980. Thus began a new genre of city eateries: the food hall.</p><p>Food halls in NYC first existed as jumbled masses of stalls and people but have since transformed into carefully curated groups of restaurants chosen for quality and authenticity. These food halls have become more and more popular, with over 20 in NYC alone and five more set to open by 2018.</p><p>They have opened in train stations and warehouses to feed tens of thousands of visitors a day. These large spaces packed with stalls of a diverse array of cuisine allow people to get a taste of the world within the confines of their city. Food halls represent what is truly great about this city—the diverse range of cultures that thrive in our five boroughs—and allow us to share and appreciate these cultures.</p><p>Chelsea Market</p><p>Chelsea Market resembles an abandoned building fallen into disrepair, but in a way that seems very intentional—it features exposed brick and pipes, chipping paint, and graffiti-like wall art. There’s even a water fountain designed to look like a leak from an exposed pipe.</p><p>This market was a pioneer for food halls in the city and is now a NYC classic, frequented by tourists and residents alike. Every turn of the head brings a new restaurant or shop with its own aesthetic to your attention.</p><p>The range of food options is incredible—almost overwhelming—with each possible choice better than the last. From the chewy noodles served in simmering broth at Very Fresh Noodles to mini donuts with strange combinations of flavors that somehow mesh together in the perfect way at Doughnuttery, Chelsea Market is the one food hall that will truly never disappoint, no matter what you’re craving.</p><p>Try: Pollo asado tacos ($3.50 each) & horchata ($3.75) at Los Tacos No. 1</p><p>The Plaza Food Hall</p><p>Tucked inside the famous Plaza Hotel, with its reputation for luxury and glamour, the Plaza Food Hall yields high expectations but falls short on delivery. Upon entry, the atmosphere is stilted, and the décor comes across as tacky and overdone. In terms of food, there isn’t much variety—many of the stalls are bakeries. Some notable examples are Lady M, featuring its signature crêpe cakes layered with cream, and FP Patisserie, serving a variety of cakes and pastries.</p><p>However, the options for savory food are sparse. Two popular shops, No. 7 Sub and Chi Dumpling & Noodle, dish out mediocre food at unfair prices. Though some stalls do serve fresh and high-quality food, the majority of food at the Plaza is disproportionately expensive and can leave the entire hall feeling like an overpriced tourist trap. Ultimately, it is up to consumers to decide if they can afford the hit to their wallets.</p><p>Try: Green tea crepe cake ($9.00) at Lady M & Clam chowder ($6.50) at Luke’s Crab Shack</p><p>Canal Street Market</p><p>For those craving Asian food, look no further than Canal Street Market, one of the newest players in the NYC food hall game. The décor is modern and clean, and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed, a minimalistic contrast to other food halls.</p><p>As far as food goes, there aren’t as many choices as some other food halls offer, but of the food selection, there is a good variety of traditional and more modern, trendy dishes for an affordable price.</p><p>Buy a bento box from Izakaya Samurice for a filling entree or grab a quick bite from the dim sum stand Nom Wah Kuai. There’s even bubble tea, courtesy of The Boba Guys, if you’re looking for a sweet, refreshing respite from the heat. This hall is a great spot to sit and relax with friends without breaking the bank.</p><p>Try: Japanese curry rice ($10.00) at Izakaya Samurice & anything from Nom Wah Kuai ($5.00)</p><p>Industry City Food Hall</p><p>Located in an inconspicuous Brooklyn neighborhood, Industry City has a luxury that many Manhattan food halls don’t: space. Each vendor at Industry City has its own enclosed area with sitting space, rather than the classic small stalls that most food halls employ. It also has a nice outdoor space, with ample room to eat and relax, and even occasional live music events.</p><p>While the atmosphere of the hall is pleasant, the food itself leaves something to be desired. There isn’t much of a standout restaurant—food at the iconic Avocaderia, the world’s first avocado bar, is better to take pictures of than actually eat. Though some places have decent food, such as Ends Meat, a cured meat and sandwich shop, or One Girl Cookies, a small bakery and cafe, there really isn’t much at Industry City to draw customers out of their way to Sunset Park.</p><p>Try: Whoopie pie ($3.00) at One Girl Cookies</p><p>Urbanspace Vanderbilt</p><p>Upon entry to Urbanspace Vanderbilt, customers are greeted with a lively scene—the hustle and bustle of businesspeople in the heart of Manhattan. Vendors and customers alike are packed together into an almost overflowing space, without enough seating to accommodate everyone.</p><p>However, these crowds don’t detract from the food, which is the real star of the show. This food hall features a variety of cuisines, including everything from sizzling tacos at La Palapa to authentic pad thai at Bangkok B.A.R. Portions are hearty, and prices are reasonable—just the right combination for a great lunch spot.</p><p>Try: Famous original pizza ($10.00) at Roberta’s & Strawberry yuzu ($4.00) at Korilla</p><p>Considering the fact that they cater to such a diverse range of tastes, it’s no surprise that food halls are on the rise in New York City, with many more set to open in the near future. New halls like The North End, coming to Washington Heights in 2018, or Bourdain Market, set to open in the Meatpacking District in 2019, are sure to continue to spur this trend into the future.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:01:33.725255	14	1	Chelsea Market opened its doors to thousands of hungry New Yorkers of wildly different backgrounds and tastes in food in 1980.

35	﻿Visions of Americana	visions-of-americana	<p>As New Yorkers, we tend to think of our country as two worlds: city and country, diverse and homogenous, progressive and conservative. This perspective dominates how we perceive small towns across the country, stereotyping them as everything urban life is not. With the election of Donald Trump, this division could not have been more overstated: urban areas voted one way, and the rest of the country voted the other. And yet, when I took a trip to visit upstate New York, where my dad grew up, I saw past my own stereotypes and witnessed the evolution of rural America.</p><p>We drove around winding roads dotted with houses as my dad recounted stories from his upbringing with each familiar landmark. We passed by the ice cream shop—a staple of Americana— whose sign read “Best Ice Cream in the U.S.A!” But to my dad, who grew up in a town filled with people who looked like him and sounded like him, what shocked him were the signs of growing diversity.</p><p>Interspersed with the houses that draped American flags on their front porches were houses with Puerto Rican, Dominican Republic, and Mexican flags. We passed “Blue Lives Matter” signs and front lawns bearing “I’m With Her” posters in the same instant. What we witnessed was not the old small town of yesterday, the one my father grew up in, but instead the changing face of America.</p><p>Rural America has seen the largest growth of minority populations in the United States, surpassing the growth of these populations in America’s urban centers. A 2012 National Library of Medicine report found that Hispanic populations in rural America represented 56 percent of its population growth from 2000 to 2010, and towns across America are quickly becoming more and more diverse.</p><p>A question is then raised: if suburban and rural America is becoming more diverse, why did it overwhelmingly vote for Trump? It is important to understand that while an area may become more diverse, not everyone living there is accepting of the changing status quo. A Pew Research poll found that only 20 percent of conservatives prefer to live in areas of mixed cultural diversity, meaning rural and suburban conservatives often vote for candidates who promise to restore the America of yesteryear: one that’s homogenous and less subject to change.</p><p>As we were driving, my dad and I stopped at a textile mill with a smokestack that had dominated the skyline of his town since before the Civil War. When we went inside, we found the entire factory—which had once been a staple of blue-collar jobs—had been converted into a brewery and arts center.</p><p>In her NPR article, “Leaving Urban Areas For The Political Homogeneity Of Rural Towns,” Mary Lou Reed of Kootenai County, Idaho, discusses the changing workplace of her town, noting, "The lumber mills are all gone, the mines are shuttered down, we do not have labor unions that are active.” Instead, small town Americans are embracing new businesses and enterprises across the United States. When considering this, that industrial factory-turned-brewery makes sense, and it is one small piece of a puzzle depicting a changing country.</p><p>The election of Donald Trump only heightened the perceived differences between city and rural populations. On a map of voters by county, cities in blue are swallowed up in vast expanses of rural red, as Trump won 3,084 of America's 3,141 counties. Hillary Clinton won just 57. Post-election coverage typecast the “angry white voter” who saw a changing country and voted against it as the catalyst for Trump’s victory.</p><p>This introduces another angle, one where rural Americans were pushed by our condescending urban stereotypes—describing non-urbanites as uneducated and irrational—to endorse a candidate such as Trump. A recent Salon article proves that urban intellectuals hold these stereotypes, reading, “In the ‘real America,’ people don’t read The New York Times at all. One who rejects the pursuit of knowledge will not place much emphasis on intellectual rigor when voting for president.”</p><p>Our visions of Americana tend to focus on small towns with white picket fences, local ice cream shops, and main street Fourth of July celebrations. Yet, the country is changing; towns are becoming more diverse and less reliant on industrial jobs. If we want the last election to not repeat itself, we need to embrace a changing America instead of continuing to push other Americans away.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 00:08:50.296744	2	1	Driving around my dad’s hometown in upstate New York showed me that our perceptions of small town America are wrong, and that they in fact represent a more diverse America than we give them credit for.
395	﻿Preserving a Free and Open Web	preserving-a-free-and-open-web	<p>It’s been a long day at school, and you sit down to binge watch another season of your favorite show on Netflix. However, instead of that bright red logo welcoming you into bliss, you’re met instead with a loading screen blocking you from your beloved series. In 2014, Comcast customers had their Netflix access slowed down after Netflix wouldn’t pay Comcast for continued high-speed content delivery. Netflix eventually backed down, paying Comcast for infrastructure used to speed up Netflix service. However, in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stepped in to protect all content providers’ rights with net neutrality.</p><p>Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should provide equal access to all websites by delivering them to consumers without preferential treatment or blocking. This principle has ensured that individuals, small businesses, and large corporations have equal footing to best serve consumers. However, the FCC’s vote on December 14 to abolish net neutrality now threatens small businesses, corporations, and internet consumers.</p><p>The Internet has created new opportunities and driven growth for small businesses. Online technologies have allowed small businesses to market, hire, and sell without middlemen directly to consumers, increasing profits. Many small businesses are looking to further expand their online presences. According to the National Small Business Association, over a quarter of small firms are looking to increase their profits by conducting more operations online in 2017. Net neutrality has created this opportunity by leveling the playing field between small businesses and large corporations.</p><p>The end of net neutrality is set to give larger companies a considerable edge by allowing them to pay for faster speeds. According to a research division of Google, consumers are more than 53 percent likely to give up on waiting for content to load after only three seconds, meaning that putting websites in “slow lanes” can deal crushing blows to businesses that cannot afford prioritization. With the passage of net neutrality, ISPs have quietly abandoned their promises not to create fast and slow lanes, opening small businesses to these competitive disadvantages.</p><p>Data cap exemptions, which allow usage of certain websites not to be counted against consumers’ monthly data limits, are another advantage ISPs are looking to offer. Freedom to Tinker reported that after a promotion in South Africa exempted WhatsApp from mobile data usage caps, its usage tripled, likely at the expense of other messaging apps. In an FCC hearing in 2013, Verizon counsel Helgi Walker told the commission that Verizon would be pursuing these forms of preferential treatment if it weren’t for net neutrality regulations. Verizon has already unveiled a mobile data cap exemption service for businesses, and other ISPs are sure to follow. Allowing ISPs to grant artificial advantages to established players creates barriers to entry that entrepreneurs and small businesses cannot afford, drastically limiting the diversity of content the Internet has to offer.</p><p>Net neutrality has also prevented ISPs from abusing their positions in pushing their own services and interests. For example, from 2011 to 2013, Google’s mobile payment app, Google Wallet, was blocked by AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint, who had stakes in the rival payment app Softcard. ISPs now own a plethora of their own competing services like Hulu and DirecTV that compete with private alternatives like Netflix and YouTube. Repealing net neutrality puts the free market competition of the Internet at risk in favor of a select few services operated by major telecom companies. This gutting of the free and fair Internet ultimately harms consumers, who now need to choose between using their favorite services at the cost of slower speeds and higher prices or switching to alternatives preferred by ISPs. By compelling consumers to use services supplied by the largest companies, ISPs will create an environment in which entrepreneurs cannot afford to compete, stifling innovation and allowing incumbent services to charge higher prices.</p><p>The greatest danger posed to individuals, however, is the threat to free speech. For example, Facebook’s Free Basics offers free access to a select few sponsored apps in developing countries, including the Bing search engine and Facebook itself. This trains consumers to use a limited number of services, even if they later switch to more full-featured internet plans, and limits free expression to only what sponsored sites allow. For these reasons, India instated net neutrality policies, banning Free Basics. A more chilling example occured in 2004 when Canadian telecom Telus blocked a website supporting a labor strike against the company. ISPs cannot be trusted to uphold the free speech when their interests conflict with that of the Internet community. Repealing net neutrality allows ISPs to filter the Internet, striking a death blow to the freedom we now enjoy: the freedom to view, post, and share whatever and whenever we like, from memes to political activism to almost anything imaginable.</p><p>Opponents of net neutrality, chiefly telecom officials and lobbyists, argue that Title II, a legal mechanism originally intended for phone companies which was repurposed to implement net neutrality, poses considerable regulatory burden on ISPs, stifling investment in expanding Internet access. To support his deregulatory policies, Ajit Pai, the FCC commissioner, cited one study claiming investments in new infrastructure by the twelve largest ISPs were down five percent over the last two years.</p><p>However, ISPs’ shareholder reports paint a different picture. In December 2015, AT&T told shareholders that it would deploy more fiber-optic cable in 2016 than 2015 and that its future business prospects were not affected by Title II. Similarly, December 2016 reports by Comcast and Charter admitted that Title II fears had been overblown, and the new regulations hadn’t hurt business. Repealing net neutrality fixes a nonexistent problem to the detriment of all but a few telecom companies.</p><p>The American public has the power to challenge this repeal by calling and emailing their elected representatives to push for legislation mandating net neutrality. Republicans have proposed a plan that would ban website blocking, but otherwise repeals net neutrality and thus is similarly damaging to the Internet. Democrats are pushing to reinstate net neutrality in full, but Republican opposition leaves it unlikely to be passed. In the absence of legislative action, the last recourse for the public is to take the issue to the courts. Public agencies like the FCC must have factual reasons for policy changes, and Ajit Pai’s overregulation argument doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In addition, the FCC is required to hold a public commenting period for proposed regulatory changes, but commenting on net neutrality repeal suffered from millions of fake comments which the FCC refused to investigate, and required commenting on limitations to local regulations was not held. In light of these irregularities, states’ attorneys general from Washington to Idaho to New York are planning to sue the FCC over the botched repeal process. The courts need to step in and strike down the repeal of net neutrality to protect the entire Internet ecosystem from collapse.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:44:39.402089	2018-01-23 02:44:39.520831	2	1	
45	﻿The Beauty Guru Fever	the-beauty-guru-fever	<p>We’ve all witnessed the foolishness; you’re scrolling down your Instagram feed one day, and you come across a video of someone applying his or her makeup with a hardboiled egg. Surprisingly, this is no longer an unfamiliar occurrence. In recent years, the number of so-called “beauty gurus” who have taken to social media platforms has proliferated.</p><p>Their influence seems to be as prominent as ever as young people around the world mimic trends in hair, makeup, and clothing, inspired by none other than beauty gurus. Though many of these trends may seem strange at first, they are soon devoured by the youth. It is evident that beauty influencers are transforming youth culture, one BeautyBlender at a time.</p><p>A beauty guru is a person who has a passion for some aspect of beauty, such as hair, nails, or most popularly, makeup. On social media platforms, especially YouTube and Instagram, gurus express their zeal for beauty by reviewing cosmetic products, creating hair, nail, and makeup tutorials, sharing their beauty tips and tricks, and most recently, creating challenge videos in which they race to complete their makeup in under a minute, apply a full face of children’s makeup, or complete other goofy tasks.</p><p>According to Media Life Magazine, their main demographic is women of ages 14-34, though it is not rare to find a male beauty junkie as well. 17-year-old, self-taught makeup artist James Charles became the first male spokesmodel for cosmetic brand Covergirl in 2016, setting a milestone in upsetting traditional gender roles. Bretman Rock, Jeffree Star, and Angel Merino are a few other well-known names in the community of makeup lovers.</p><p>According to YouGov polling firm, one-third of Americans are indifferent to males wearing makeup. This is a significant change from the stigma surrounding boys wearing makeup that we have seen in the past. Together, male beauty influencers help break down the barriers set by society, which discourage boys from dabbling in makeup.</p><p>In modern social media, beauty gurus are extremely prevalent on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, with the top beauty vloggers having an average of 2.1 million followers or subscribers, according to TubeFilter. Your own peers are most likely well-acquainted with at least one guru.</p><p>This popularity has allowed the impact of newly bred trends to skyrocket as we see young people explore intriguing style choices like feather brows and rainbow eyeliner. Kylie Jenner, a growing personality and trendsetter in the makeup industry, created a daring trend last August when she posed in an Instagram photo clad in jeans with rips on her butt.</p><p>At first, many were shocked and confused as to what the appeal of bare-butt jeans was. However, this style was soon adopted and appreciated by many young girls, which was not completely unexpected, considering Jenner’s colossal follower count. Some argue whether the enormous influence that Jenner wields is positively impacting the youth or simply inspiring mindless behavior, such as the popular “Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge,” in which teenagers used the suction from bottles or glasses to swell their lips and mimic Jenner’s famous pout.</p><p>Though this dangerous practice is an example of social influence gone awry, the positive aspects of Jenner’s immense influence outweigh the negatives. Though she isn’t exactly changing the world, she is setting an example for the youth in terms of appreciating one’s individuality and straying from the norm when it comes to style, all while building her empire as a young entrepreneur.</p><p>Along with setting trends, there has been an increasing number of products being promoted by these beauty influencers lately, whether it be in the form of sponsorships or reviews. One of the most famous examples of these social media-built brands is Huda Beauty. This brand was developed by Huda Kattan, who has been ranked Top Beauty Influencer by Forbes and boasts over 20 million Instagram followers.</p><p>Perhaps the most sought-after product in her makeup line is her false lashes, which hordes of makeup lovers, including Kim Kardashian, swear by. The majority of Kattan’s advertising for the brand is done on her Instagram page, which goes to show just how beneficial it can be to use social media as a publicizing platform.</p><p>Another brand that has earned much praise from the beauty guru community—and thus has seen a major boost in popularity—is Farsali Care. This skincare brand was created by beauty blogger Farah Dhukai and her husband Sal Ali. Like Huda Beauty, Farsali Care is largely promoted on Instagram, where over one million followers can scroll through the brand’s page and view descriptions, advertisements, and reviews of its products. Dhukai further publicizes Farsali Care to almost two million subscribers on her YouTube channel.</p><p>The total revenue of the cosmetic industry was a whopping $62.46 billion in 2016, having risen from $53 billion in 2010, according to statistics portal Statista. During the same period of time, there was a 90 percent increase in the number of beauty channels on YouTube, according to CultureMachines polling firm.</p><p>This flourishing market, nurtured by the growing beauty guru trend, has led to a surge in the popularity of products created by beauty gurus. As these products are reviewed and featured in makeup tutorials and circulated within the beauty community, the gurus encourage viewers to succumb to consumerism culture. Given the huge following that this community maintains, it’s no surprise that marketing done by beauty gurus further propels their popularity as well as their products.</p><p>Beauty influencers are no strangers to sponsorships, either. From teeth whitening kits to tummy toning tea, there is a vast range of products that companies pay beauty gurus to advertise.  Companies often propose sponsorship offers to beauty gurus because of their large following and exposure.</p><p>From their questionable style trends to their signature makeup tutorials, beauty gurus have helped us become desensitized to the practices that would have once resulted in reverberating culture shock, such as boys wearing makeup or people sprinkling glitter in their hair.</p><p>Pictures and videos demonstrating such distinctive applications appear constantly on various platforms of social media, gaining exposure until they finally begin to inspire young people to take part in creating their own unique style, which gradually leads to a stronger sense of self-identity and love.</p><p>This is what sets the youth apart from previous generations: a greater general acceptance of individual flawed beauty, uniqueness, and originality. Beauty gurus have helped us hugely in achieving this, and it seems that they will continue to do so.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2018-01-13 14:47:06.989731	19	1	A thinkpiece on the influence beauty gurus have on our culture and younger generations in particular.
46	﻿Craziest Program Changes (Program Office Hates Them!)	craziest-program-changes-program-office-hates-them	<p>At least 100 percent of Stuyvesant students try their hand at “program changes,” or, as you might have seen it manifested, “loudly complaining to guidance and/or anyone who will listen; having concerning mental breakdowns in Ms. Pedrick’s office; lamenting the fact that there are more than two flights of stairs between two classes; and spending a minimum of 25 hours after school in a stress-filled extravaganza only to be told that there was never any space to begin with in that class.”</p><p>And so, year after year, the Program Office faces off with an endless crowd of angry Stuyvesant students, each demanding changes that involve at least 10 teacher swaps and 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 period swaps.</p><p>________________</p><p>Freshman Ovahr Kompensaytin was not looking for any old “Can I not get [fill in unpopular teacher here] this semester” program change. On his mission, Kompensaytin fought his way through the Program Office. When his turn came to be rejected, he confidently strode to the front of the office, not discouraged in the slightest.</p><p>“He looked me straight in the eye, undeterred by our uninterested, monotone voices, and flat-out refusal to consider his predicament,” an unperturbed administrator told us. “Then, he loudly explained that he wanted eight APs before breakfast, including but not limited to AP Biology of Extraterrestrial Species, AP Physics D (the mythological class that succeeds AP Physics C), AP Future History, and AP Lunch. We tried to calmly explain that AP Breakfast was a prerequisite for AP Lunch, but he explained that he intended to double up by having AP Brunch.</p><p>“He also demanded 12 electives that are for seniors only and that he be the only student in the class so that he can have a personal, one-on-one educational experience with the teacher. As for the other 37 APs that he is demanding, he mentioned a ‘strong work ethic’ and enrollment in Stuyvesant High School, which certainly convinced me.”</p><p>________________</p><p>Kompensaytin’s episode was only the beginning. In his stead entered a furious senior, Iza Slackin. “I don’t understand how they could do me dirty like this. Honestly, I feel personally attacked,” Slackin remarked. “I mean, mandatory attendance? Are they serious? I’m a senior. You can’t try to fool me. Get real,” she said.</p><p>Quite reasonably, Slackin desired four periods of lunch, and she also wanted to take a self-made Napping 101 elective. The Program Office pointed out that Slackin had taken five APs junior year with a 98 average and was now pulling up to school for a total of 15 minutes weekly with a 65.001 average.</p><p>________________</p><p>Anxious to get rid of Slackin, the Program Office hurriedly gestured for junior Trayin Tuhard to come in. The epitome of determination and perfectionism, Tuhard was not willing to compromise on any of his desired program changes. His carefully devised stratagem would require 53 maneuvers, including firing multiple beloved teachers, expelling 27 highly qualified students who were placed in the classes he wanted, sending multiple strongly worded e-mails from his parents, and involving Child Protective Services.</p><p>Tuhard insisted that all of his classes be arranged from the 10th floor to the first and that there be an elevator waiting for him on the second floor at 7:55 AM to bring him up to the 10th. In order to accomplish this, he demanded that the physics department be relocated to the cafeteria and that lunch would take place in the library, horrifying Stuyvesant’s dedicated library staff. Unsatisfied with all of his teachers, Tuhard insisted that his English class be taught by Stephen King, his physics class by Stephen Hawking, and his U.S. history class by Barack Obama.</p><p>While the Program Office was hesitant at first, the staff soon realized that while they might be able to shake off Child Protection Services and the whole brunt of the U.S. Department of Education, they simply could not shake off Tuhard and his overbearing parents.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:08:26.273815	5	1	Crazy students come into the the program office to ask for a number of whack program changes.
49	﻿How Impossible Is the Indians Streak?	how-impossible-is-the-indians-streak	<p>From Michael Jordan sending the Cavaliers home in 1989 and a heartbreaking game seven loss in the 1997 World Series to LeBron James taking his talents to South Beach in 2010, Cleveland has a rough history when it comes to sports.</p><p>However, things have started to turn around. LeBron brought a title back to his hometown, and the Indians made it to the World Series. And, even though they lost to the only team with a more pathetic history in the MLB in the Chicago Cubs, there was still hope. Fast forward to August 24 and the Indians were 69-50, atop the AL Central division.</p><p>After five games, they were on a hot streak. After 10, I started following them so closely that I got notifications when they won. After 15, I, along with thousands of MLB fans, was checking the box scores to see if they had gotten any closer to the magic number 20—the American League record set in 2002 by Billy Beane’s Moneyball Oakland Athletics. On the afternoon of September 13, they crossed the metaphorical plateau and cemented the Indians in MLB history, pulling off the seemingly impossible. The streak would end two days later at 22, giving Cleveland the longest winning streak in MLB history.</p><p>So, exactly how impossible was it? While it was incredibly rare, how would it stack up to lightning strikes, three-peats, and coconut deaths? Let’s take a look:</p><p>3000-to-1: Being struck by lightning in your lifetime. Statistically, one out of every Stuy student picking up this paper will be struck by lightning at some point in his or her life. Rare, but we can do better.</p><p>20350-to-1: Being murdered in the United States in a calendar year (2014 statistics). Don’t let this scare you, but you are much more likely to be murdered in the next twelve months than the Indians were to go on this winning streak. But sleep well tonight!</p><p>27000-to-1: Odds of a three-peat in the MLB (or NBA). Even if you assume that all teams are equal, the odds of a three-peat still fall far short of being as rare as Cleveland’s streak.</p><p>75000-to-1: Being hit by a comet. A lot cooler, but nowhere near as rare. Let’s keep going.</p><p>200000-to-1: Giving birth to conjoined twins.</p><p>954056-to-1: Odds of getting into top-five colleges per U.S. News and World Report. Using Class of 2021 statistics and assuming all students are somehow equal, the odds of being accepted into Princeton, Yale, Harvard, University of Chicago, and Columbia are still twice as likely as the Indians’ win streak.</p><p>1048576-to-1: The Athletics’ 20-game winning streak. It doesn’t take a genius to realize this is four times as likely as the 22-game win streak. Still, the record stood for 15 years, and it made a movie about math and baseball interesting.</p><p>2396304-to-1: Throwing back-to-back no-hitters. Seemingly impossible but still less rare than the streak is another amazing accomplishment in MLB history. Accomplished only once by Johnny Vander Meer in 1938, this is a record likely to never be touched with the development of pitch counts and strong bullpens.</p><p>4194304-to-1: The Indians 22-game winning streak.</p><p>250,000,000-to-1: Odds of dying by coconut. As promised, here are the odds of dying by coconut. Coming in as more common than death by shark attack (300,000,000-to-1), death by coconut blows the Indians win streak out of the water in terms of rarity. If the Indians had managed to extend the win streak six more games to 28 in a row, they would have passed the coconut milestone, but now it’ll be a long time before any team comes close to breaking through that barrier.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:14:12.878515	25	1	Following a 22-game win streak by the Indians, I take a look at how impossible that really is.
43	﻿The Story of Dunkirk	the-story-of-dunkirk	<p>“Dunkirk” is a movie about war, but doesn’t depict war’s violence. In fact, this film is not really about violent conflict; it is more about what desperate people do in desperate situations.</p><p>The movie opens with  five soldiers rummaging through the deserted French town of Dunkirk. Suddenly, ghostly gunfire sends the soldiers running until there is only one left, who barely makes it over a picket fence to safety. The remaining soldier is the film’s protagonist, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), and he is characteristically quiet. He later meets another soldier, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), who buries a dead comrade.</p><p>They emerge on the expansive Dunkirk beach, whose white sands and dull blue skies would be picturesque if it weren’t for the masses of straggling soldiers cooped up on the shores. The scenes following are set mostly on land near the makeshift pier, called “The Mole,” that the Allies are using to evacuate their soldiers from Dunkirk. In the short time that it took for Tommy to go from the town to the beach, the film has already displayed fear, need, and sadness.</p><p>The film switches back and forth between three segments: The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. “The Mole” takes place over the course of a week as Tommy and his fellow soldiers are struggling to survive the chaos that takes place to evacuate Dunkirk’s beaches. “The Sea” is a day onboard the “Moonstone,” a small boat joining an armada of other civilians and their ragtag vessels in an attempt to help rescue the soldiers. “The Air” follows three Spitfire pilots for an hour as they try to bring down enemy planes and protect the escaping minesweepers and boats full of soldiers.</p><p>There is no violence. This film is about its soldiers and rarely does it mention what the war is about or who the enemy is. The soldiers aren’t fighting or participating in typical acts of war. They’re just fighting to survive in acts of human plight. All of the characters look tired, depressed, and pessimistic. The first soldier that the Moonstone rescues is so shell-shocked that he accidentally injures and ultimately kills one of the civilians on board the boat. In an earlier scene, Tommy and Gibson are sitting on the Dunkirk shore after being rescued from yet another sinking ship. A soldier staggers past them and heads right toward the ocean. A wave of foam and water engulfs him, but there is no splashing and struggling for life. The man disappears in an act that says, “This is what war does to men.”</p><p>The movie’s stubborn portrayal of only human endeavors contributes to its intensity. This intensity is based on tension and suspense, not in one realm, but in several as the camera seamlessly moves between Tommy writhing in flaming oily water and a Spitfire pilot thinking he’ll drown in the cockpit of his downed plane. Everything is intertwined by the environment and actions of the characters. Depicting nothing in chronological order is reminiscent of how the average person tells stories, sometimes skipping around or going back and forth between events.</p><p>What the movie lacks in scale, it makes up for by showing the beauty of the basic struggle for life. None of the characters do more than what is necessary in a war where rescuing human lives is a priority. There is no heroic speech or overly patriotic feeling. Plenty of soldiers are traumatized and plenty more die. One of the Spitfire pilots manages to stop an especially deadly German assault on one of the evacuating warships but runs out of fuel and lands far from the pier.</p><p>One of the most beautiful moments in the film is when the pilot sets his plane on fire to prevent it from being used by the Germans. Even as Germans arrive onto the scene, their faces are blurry and the focus stays on the pilot’s figure as he stares at the Spitfire. Defiance and courage in the face of his capture is the only patriotic moment of the film and presents a sense of reassurance and relief.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 05:27:57.55516	13	1	“Dunkirk” is not a story about war, but about human endeavor.
37	﻿Trump: Making America Ignorant Again	trump-making-america-ignorant-again	<p>We’re halfway through 2017: Taiwan became the first Asian country to allow same-sex marriage, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau became the first sitting prime minister to participate in the country’s Pride festival, and Malta passed a new act that makes it illegal to try to “change, repress or eliminate a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression.” However, while the rest of the world moves forward this year, the U.S. is taking a major step back. At the end of August, President Trump signed a memo officially banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.</p><p>A year ago, the Obama administration announced that transgender Americans could be in the military, and the Pentagon would cover the costs of those in uniform to go through gender transition. The U.S. had finally seemed to join the list of countries, including the United Kingdom, Israel, and Canada, that were making an effort to move toward a less judgmental society. President Trump is now attempting to undo this step toward equality.</p><p>The Trump administration knows that our military is struggling financially. With low numbers of soldiers, outdated equipment, and too much turmoil around the world, the U.S. military could use as many soldiers as possible, according to the Heritage Foundation’s 2017 Index of U.S. Military Strength. The RAND corporation, a national research and analysis service, found that the new ban would affect from 2,000 to 11,000 active soldiers, as well as thousands who are looking to join. The Heritage Foundation further states that the United States cannot survive such a blow, with troops already deployed in 180 different countries and not enough back home.</p><p>President Trump believes that transgender individuals are too mentally unstable to serve our country, stating that the U.S. cannot be burdened with the “disruption that transgenders in the military would entail.” However, the RAND study, looking at countries that allow transgender people to serve in their militaries, found that these foreign militaries agree that having transgender troops has “little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness.”</p><p>President Trump sees the presence of transgender individuals in the military as entailing “tremendous medical costs and disruption.” He argues that it costs too much for the United States to pay for gender reassignment surgery for its transgender soldiers, taking away from the “decisive and overwhelming victory” our military should win.</p><p>The Obama administration, however, proved the opposite. When President Obama first brought the issue up to the American public, the RAND corporation found that “[U.S. military] health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending.” The slight increase in military spending proved to the Obama administration that allowing transgender individuals into the military did no harm.</p><p>Multiple LGBTQ organizations are filing lawsuits challenging Trump’s new policy, and politicians are joining together to craft acts against the ban. The Stuyvesant community, too, must do what we can to avoid the backward steps that our country is taking. We must stand together as a community to show our opposition to it.</p><p>We must keep our school’s LGBTQ community comfortable and raise awareness that Trump’s policy is discriminatory and unacceptable. The acknowledgement that we, as the student body of Stuyvesant, and as the future generation of New Yorkers and Americans, do not accept or approve of this new ban shows our dedication to equality as well as freedom. While that may not change Trump’s policies toward transgenders, our actions can show the LGBTQ students in our school that they are welcome and respected here.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 14:18:24.10776	2	1	Why transgender people should not be banned from the military.
276	My Encounter with the “Dark Side”	my-encounter-with-the-dark-side	<p>The election of Donald Trump to the presidency has catapulted a number of figures with controversial opinions and affiliations into the national debate. None of these members of Trump’s political team is more controversial than Stephen Bannon. Bannon, a former naval officer and investment banker for Goldman Sachs, has, in recent years, been a prominent voice at the Breitbart news website. He has been accused of using his position as a platform to further the agenda of a group known as the Alt-Right, which aims at a restoration of white nationalism in the United States. There are striking similarities between this movement and the “Know Nothing” Party of the 1850s, with the important exception that the Know Nothings never won a general election.</p><p>Bannon left Breitbart late last summer to become an advisor to then-candidate Trump’s campaign. He has now been named as “chief strategist” for the incoming administration. Senator Harry Reid, among others, has prominently criticized this move, accusing Bannon of being “a champion of white supremacists.” It remains to be seen whether president-elect Trump will stick with his choice, or yield to the voices calling for Bannon’s removal from the inner circles of power. For his part, Bannon gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter on November 18 outlining his agenda and political philosophy. His emphasis in the interview was on a robust economic nationalism, not race: ”Like [Andrew] Jackson's populism, we're going to build an entirely new political movement… It's everything related to jobs.” He insisted that his role was as the administration’s purveyor of “Darkness” (his choice of words) the person who would use uncertainty and fear like Darth Vader (his example) to push the administration’s agenda, and keep its opponents off balance. I have watched Bannon’s rise with great interest. I had never heard of him until early last summer, and even then knew very little.  Yet I had the experience of having spoken with Bannon directly.</p><p>Last June, when my new book, “Rendezvous with Death” was released, my publicist put together a promotional campaign. I gave interviews, wrote articles, and spoke at various venues. One of the interviews was with the radio station operated by Breitbart news. The only thing I had ever heard about Breitbart was earlier in the spring when a female reporter for the website claimed she had been physically accosted by Donald Trump’s then-campaign manager at an event in Florida. My publicist said that it would be a great opportunity to reach millions of potential readers at what she characterized as a conservative counterpart of The Huffington Post. The interview itself was pretty ordinary. Bannon demonstrated some knowledge of history (which, in my experience, journalists are not often very informed about) and had claimed that he had read both my new book, and my first book on the War of 1812. He didn’t ask me any questions regarding contemporary politics or race relations, and I had no reason to anticipate that he would do so. Basically, I just talked about the book:  a story of a small group of Americans who joined the French Army in 1914 to fight the Kaiser’s invading army, and in so doing helped defend France and civilization itself, in their view. The summer rolled on, and I watched with alarm as Donald Trump was nominated by the Republican Party as its candidate for president. Then, in August, I read about Stephen Bannon joining Trump’s campaign, and his connections to the Alt-Right. This movement’s racist positions were disturbing. It seemed strange that the person I had spoken with could support these types of views. He seemed so <i>ordinary</i>. I recalled how he had claimed to have read my books, and this also struck a discordant note.</p><p>Both of the books that I have written include passages that are very critical of America’s historical record on race. They also both emphasize the heroic contributions of African Americans during the yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia in 1793, in the ultimately-doomed defense of Washington against the British in 1814, in the fight against Germany in the trenches, and in the skies over France, in 1914-1918. One of the main figures in my new book is the light heavyweight boxer, Bob Scanlon, of Mobile, Alabama, who became a close friend of poet Alan Seeger. He had made his way to Paris at a time when being black in America meant always having to live with the threat of mob violence just beneath the surface of American society. France, and Paris specifically, had given so much to Scanlon. He enlisted in the Foreign Legion in August, 1914, to repay this debt. Furthermore, the title of the fifth chapter in “Rendezvous with Death” is written in Arabic because it immortalizes a famous battle in Artois in 1915, in which the Americans fought side-by-side with Muslim soldiers from North Africa in a ferocious assault on Vimy Ridge. The Arabic printed on the chapter heading translates as “No Fear, No Pity”: the unit’s motto.  I wondered how Bannon could be the rabid racist he was being depicted as in the national media if he had, in fact, read my books and genuinely enjoyed them as much as he seemed. These two things just did not go together.</p><p>Perhaps he didn’t ever read my books. It’s been the rare journalist that I’ve encountered as an author, who has actually read one of my books. His enthusiasm might simply have been a courtesy to my publisher. Regnery History is, for the most part, a mainstream popular history list (it currently has a New York Times bestseller in a book called “Sgt. Reckless,” a true story about America’s version of “War Horse”). However, its parent company, Regnery publishing, is a conservative press that publishes more polemical books. I first became aware of Regnery History when it published Ronald Utt’s War of 1812 book, “Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron.” For a book on what is a relatively obscure topic for most readers, it did quite well. I thought the edition that they had come out with was very handsome. As an author of what was, frankly, a competitor book, “Knights of the Sea,” I have to admit I was a little jealous. When my agent received an offer from Regnery History for “Rendezvous,” and was able to get them to come up a bit, I took it. Reflecting back on the interview now, I think the possibility certainly exists that Bannon incorrectly assumed that I was a conservative author because Regnery publishing is the parent company of Regnery History. In fact, my publisher submitted my book to the Conservative Book Club hoping to reach a wider audience. From a marketing perspective this made some sense, since my new book is one that could appeal to both liberal and conservative readers. It deals with the polarizing topic of U.S. intervention in World War I (particularly as it related to the Seeger brothers, Charles and Alan), but it does not deal with any contemporary issues that polarize our country. Though I see nothing wrong with having a conservative political philosophy, my own politics lean more toward the center-left. In fact, on education and labor they are decidedly far left. So it is fair to say that Mr. Bannon made an incorrect assumption. And yet, I wonder.</p><p>One of the things that is abundantly clear in the Hollywood Reporter interview is how well-versed in history Stephen Bannon is. He has more than just a passing interest in it. How someone who is accused of spreading such vile views could endorse books with black and Muslim heroes is a riddle to me. I never met Bannon face to face, we conducted the interview on the phone, but I would be lying if I now claimed he was some sort of ogre. He wasn’t. He was a gracious and enthusiastic host. We want our villains to be sinister all the time, but the reality is they can be knowledgeable, even charming. I must say, I found his final comments in the interview that he gave very interesting indeed. In trying to explain how he envisioned his role in a Trump administration, he said he would be like “Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.” As NPR’s Kai Ryssdal remarked, it’s certainly worth noting that Cromwell, Henry VIII’s political “hatchet man” was executed once he’d exhausted his usefulness to the king.</p>	107	6	\N	2016-12-06 22:57:55.149	2017-12-08 02:27:36.911883	2	1

However, the incentive of free school lunch has drawn many of these lunchtime adventurers to once again enjoy some “good ol’ school lunch.” The reactions to free school lunch have been overwhelmingly positive, as evidenced by the gargantuan line in the cafeteria that resembled the line at program changes.</p><p>“I’ve never tasted anything so divine,” said senior Austin Leung, in describing the school lunch breadsticks. “Their flavorless taste just gives my palate so much more room to experiment with imagining palatable heaven.”</p><p>“The black mold on the bottom of my pizza looks just like the perfect amount of oven crispiness,” Leung continued. “The cheese leaves an excellent feeling in my mouth. It looks and tastes just like my grand-daddy’s colostomy bag. For the record, I have no idea how that tastes, but I think that the pizza comes pretty close.”</p><p>“I think having nails attached to the chicken fingers is a huge improvement!” senior Daniel Ju said. “They add a really surprising crunch to the otherwise tender chicken fingers.

They must be upset that I gave them all Fs and, in one case, salmonella.”</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:09:32.94534	5	1	“Why did I buy popcorn chicken when the cafeteria served this?”—Daniel Ju, senior
51	Most Impactful Moves from the 2017 NBA Off-season	most-impactful-moves-from-the-2017-nba-off-season	<p>The 2016-2017 NBA season was one of the most exciting seasons in basketball history. The departure of small forward Kevin Durant from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Golden State Warriors caused the former to barely qualify as a playoff team and the latter to win a championship in June. At the same time, his move allowed point guard Russell Westbrook to shatter records that have been in place for over 50 years and emerge as the league’s MVP.</p><p>This proves that one player’s departure from or arrival on a team can profoundly influence the outcome of a NBA season. That’s why this NBA offseason was so interesting: left and right, franchise players left teams they had played their entire careers with while others were traded to a new destination. The movement of so many top-15, and even some top-10, players this offseason will certainly cause below .500 teams to emerge as potential conference-finals contenders. On the other hand, many playoff teams will be forced to undergo the tedious process of rebuilding.</p><p>Arguably the best player to swap jerseys this summer was point guard Chris Paul. The Los Angeles Clippers’ decision to trade their leader and floor general for a bunch of average, and at times even below-average, players from the Houston Rockets shows that they have begun to pursue the process of rebuilding.</p><p>With shooting guard James Harden, the MVP runner-up, and Sixth Man of the Year shooting guard Eric Gordon playing alongside Paul, the Rockets now have a top trio on paper in the Western Conference. Small forward Trevor Ariza, power forward Ryan Anderson, and center Clint Capela each have the capability to contribute some valuable points every night, and their plays can only be enhanced by the excellent passing of Chris Paul.</p><p>Small forward Paul George being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder was another significant move. George, who averaged 23.7 points per game (PPG) last season will excellently complement MVP point guard Russell Westbrook. Though being on the same team as top-10 NBA players is nothing new for Westbrook, he has the potential to develop a Westbrook-Durant chemistry with George and be extremely dominant when they’re both on the court. This time around, Westbrook will look to take that extra step to win the championship, which eluded Oklahoma City in their years trotting out Durant and Westbrook.</p><p>The arrival of point guard Kyrie Irving and small forward Gordon Hayward in Boston are two acquisitions that bring the Celtics even closer to the caliber of their Eastern Conference rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Both players are dominant scorers and find themselves in the top-15 or top-20 players of the NBA, with Irving averaging 25.2 PPG last season and Hayward having 21.9 PPG. Both players are elite scorers who can explode for 30 or even 40+ points in any given game, and they are surrounded by other highly capable scorers like recently acquired power forward Marcus Morris (14.0 PPG) and center Al Horford (14.0 PPG). Boston’s addition of young and elite scorers will prove to be a smart decision when they are given the opportunity to dethrone the Cavaliers as kings of the East.</p><p>On the other side of the Kyrie Irving trade were the Cleveland Cavaliers, who received  point guard Isaiah Thomas and shooting guard/small forward Jae Crowder. Thomas is one of the league’s truly unstoppable scorers as he averaged 28.9 PPG last season. Offensive-minded guards have historically dominated alongside small forward LeBron James. Crowder is also a skilled scorer (13.9 PPG), whose main contribution is his lockdown perimeter defense, something the Cavaliers have long been desperate for.</p><p>The most surprising team to improve this offseason was the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were able to add small forward Jimmy Butler and point guard Jeff Teague. Butler is one of the best two-way players in the NBA (23.9 PPG & 1.9 steals per game) and continues to improve. Teague is a veteran point guard who has the ability to score and pass well (15.3 PPG and 7.8 assists per game). The addition of an elite two-way player and an able point guard to a team with two players, shooting guard Andrew Wiggins and center Karl-Anthony Towns, who are both under 23 but combine for 50 or 60 points almost every game makes Minnesota a true powerhouse, at least on paper.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the most impactful move this offseason wasn’t a three-team trade or a signing of a big-time free agent. Rather, it was the ability for the Golden State Warriors to keep virtually everyone on their team. Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson are in the prime of their careers and are predicted only to improve. Key players like Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston and role players like Javale McGee were kept, and the Golden State even added role players Omri Casspi and Nick Young. With all the franchise players and NBA stars moving to join better teams, it still may not be enough to stop a repeat in Oakland.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:14:24.388418	25	1	Summarizing and analyzing the effect of the most impactful moves this NBA off-season.

Teachers first assumed that the seniors were suffering from Halloween-related maladies, but the excuse notes pouring in the next day painted an entirely different picture.

There better be a curve.” “I’m so tired! I got like two hours of sleep last night studying for this APUSH test; I feel dead.” “I think I copped a 50.”</p><p>The constant barrage of complaints in the hallways has led the administration to enact a school-wide ban on certain conversations. These include:</p><p><ul><li>Any discussion of grades, tests, colleges, or impending deadlines</li><li>Complaints about homework or projects</li><li>Complaints regarding sleep</li><li>The word <del>“coffee”</del></li></ul></p><p>Following the ban, an eerie silence has descended upon Stuyvesant. On multiple occasions, students have opened their mouths to comment, only to promptly shut them again. Friends that once considered themselves inseparable have stopped talking altogether.</p><p>Teachers were overjoyed by the administration’s decision. Chemistry teacher Gabriel Ting said, “My inbox is, for the first time in years, completely empty! No more demands about every infinitesimal grade calculation! No more questions about the numerical equivalent of a B+, and whether that can be curved to a 97!”</p><p>An anonymous teacher commented, “I haven’t talked to my colleagues in a while since I no longer complain about my annoying and needy kids.”</p><p>The ban looks to clamp down especially hard on whiny overachievers. Students with 95-plus averages face crueler punishments for claiming to be “unprepared” or “so screwed” for tests that they will definitely get at least a 95 on. Such punishments include changing their grade to an actual failing grade.</p><p>One anonymous overachieving student claimed, “Just because I’ve been preparing for this physics test rigorously for the past two weeks doesn’t mean I can’t act concerned when test day rolls around! I need to project my superiority complex onto others somehow!”</p><p>The ban was effective for three entire days, until Thursday rolled around, and students could no longer refrain from commenting on the injustice of the latest pre-calc test. With an absolute disregard for the ban, juniors huddled in the fourth floor bathrooms desperately moaning about how question 13 was never talked about in class.</p><p>Unfortunately, Stuyvesant’s security team discovered them after forcing 23 students off the benches. The juniors were forced to sacrifice a week of lunch periods, excluded from the library, and forced to socialize rather than be productive as they watched their teachers assign project after project over the weekend.</p><p>However, recent subversions have rendered the ban unworkable. Much of the school has learned Morse code, using it to communicate with pen clicks during class—annoying teachers to the brink of insanity. The foreign language department has developed a brand new language: Eway Atehay Choolsay. The administration is considering a revamp of the ban by instructing teachers to write letters of recommendation in Morse code or Eway Atehay Choolsay.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:57:38.910269	5	1	
277	Teacher’s Take: History: Worthy of Study On Its Own Merits	teacher-s-take-history-worthy-of-study-on-its-own-merits	<p>I was a little hesitant at first after The Spectator asked me to write on a topic of my choosing. After all, I had just completed my first year teaching at Stuyvesant in June. Though my experience teaching here is as valid as anyone else’s, it is neither broad nor deep. In fact, it has primarily been confined to a slice of the building on the third and second floors, where I share an office space and teach my classes. So, instead of writing on Stuyvesant specifically, I felt I should write on something where I might enjoy greater credibility with students and colleagues: history. This will be my 18th year teaching history, and frankly, I can’t imagine doing anything else.</p><p>I love teaching history. One of my fondest memories is of fishing on the Maine coast with my grandfather while he told me about Hannibal and his army of elephants crossing the alps.* History holds the same fascination for me now as it did then. For me, the past has always been this distant, unreachable country that at the same time is strangely near. I suppose this is a result of us all being part of something larger than ourselves—the story of humanity—a continuum with all those that came before, and all who will follow. I must admit, however, that the future, in a broad sense, holds little interest for me. I’m an antiquarian. What use is this? i’ve often heard this question posed in one form or another, both as a student and as a teacher. That in order for history to justify its inclusion in the curriculum it needs to possess a utilitarian function. As if something couldn’t possibly have value if it didn’t have a practical application. When I cast my line into the water beside my grandfather as he introduced me to classical history all those years ago, this was the last thing on my mind. It was interesting, and that was enough.</p><p>Later, as a more serious student of history, I often heard the justification that those who ignore history are bound to repeat its errors. Initially, this thesis appeared sound. I didn’t question it. However, as I learned of its application in both the present and the past, I found it didn’t bear close scrutiny. As the greek philosopher Heraclitus once postulated, you can never step in the same river twice. Like a river, the continuum of the story of humanity is constantly changing. The variables are nearly endless. Alexander Kerensky’s decision to launch his July offensive in 1917, following the overthrow of the czar and the establishment of the provisional government, comes to mind. Like most of the Russian Revolution’s leading gures, Kerensky was a keen student of the French revolution. The lesson that he drew from it in this instance was that a free citizenry of a nascent democracy would be able to sweep the forces of autocracy by dint of sheer revolutionary enthusiasm, as had the French levée en masse at the Battle of Valmy in 1792. Later, after his most enthusiastic troops had been mowed down by German machine guns, the offensive sputtered out. Kerenesky was left with his authority and credibility permanently eroded, thus paving the way for his great rival, Lenin, to come to power. Kerensky knew his history, but he drew the wrong lessons from it. More recently, I recall quite well the learned opinions of those who confidently predicted the Iraq War would prove to be a repetition of the Vietnam War. To be sure, there were certain similarities between the two. But they were very different wars, motivated by very different lines of thinking, with different outcomes. Did George W. Bush draw lessons from Lyndon Johnson’s actions in an earlier decade? I don’t know. But even if he had—which lessons? Were they the correct ones? This is the problem with using history as some kind of tool. It can provide examples, inspire, and shed light on how others pursued certain courses of action, but it is not a failsafe predictor of future events (e.g. this policy will absolutely result in X because it did so in the past). Additionally, beware those ambitious minds that craft grand, unifying historical theses—Karl Marx comes to mind. In my opinion, his manifesto is brilliant (and prescient), but it conveniently ignores, or trammels over, the power that nationalism and religion wielded in his own times, and in our own. Again, there are too many variables for history to be reduced to a formula.</p><p>So, if not a tool, then what value is there in learning history? Well, there is the craft of history itself: the analysis of documents; acquiring familiarity with highly regarded secondary sources; an awareness of how the process of revision makes history a subject that is always becoming (i.e. not static); and writing effectively, and often persuasively. These types of exercises develop one’s intellect and cultivate critical thinking. There is little to criticize here. And yet, as much as I like to emphasize historiography (when possible) and writing, these, to me, are not the primary reasons why I believe history is important. Ultimately, it comes back to the story. A story that encompasses all of mankind’s various endeavors and hopes. Art, literature, diplomacy, finance, architecture, industry, science, philosophy, exploration, government, law, faith, war: all are part of this story. And we are part of it. The simple act of taking an interest in one’s surroundings (How was my neighborhood created? Why?) demonstrates a capacity for historical empathy and opens up the possibility of seeing the present in a fresh way. If nothing else, the ability to discern the difference between a Gothic and a Romanesque arch, or discuss Zola’s role in the Dreyfus affair, or examine the impact of the GI Bill on post-war American society makes one a more interesting person to spend time with, and makes one’s life simply more interesting as a whole. I think that, in this, history is a gift. iI binds us, brings vitality to life, and improves our minds. It’s a bit of a mix of Homer and Socrates. And that’s pretty good company to keep.</p><p><i>* There is lack of agreement among historians whether Hannibal was able to get his elephants across the alps alive to Italy.</i></p>	104	1	\N	2013-09-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-08 02:37:27.969486	2	1	
278	My Odyssey Teaching in New York City Schools, and What I’ve Learned From It.	my-odyssey-teaching-in-nyc-schools-and-what-ive-learned-from-it	<p>In 2008, I accepted a position as head of history at KIPP New York City College Preparatory School. I was then teaching at the American School of São Paulo in Brazil. I was in my ninth year living abroad. I had left the U.S. when Bill Clinton was president, and would be returning to an America that had recently elected Barack Obama. During those years away from home, i always made a point of stopping in New York when I was visiting the U.S., and catching up with old friends. One of them worked for KIPP. We had taught together in the late 1990s at the High School for Environmental Studies on West 56th Street. He had left the school a year or two after I had to go work at KIPP Academy Middle School in the Bronx. His old classmate at Riverdale had opened the school in 1995, and he was drawn to its mission and impressed with its results. He gave up teaching and worked full-time as a guidance counselor, helping to place the school’s graduates in elite private schools in New England and the greater metropolitan area, and then mentoring the students’ progress throughout high school. He found this to be very fulfilling work, and he’d share this with me when we met during my visits to the city. In 2007, he mentioned that KIPP was thinking of starting a high school for its middle schools to feed into (the program had expanded to Harlem and Brooklyn). He asked if I’d be interested in coming home and helping to start the school. The pay was significantly higher than that of public school teachers, and the media was pushing charter schools as the progressive future of education in the U.S. Personally, I loved the idea of founding a history department with high academic standards and expectations for black and Latino inner city youth. So in June 2009, I came home.</p><p>Within a very short period of time, I recognized that the vision I had for KIPP NYC’s history department was not shared by the administration. Partly because of the benchmarks they had to meet to maintain their charter and partly because of their own orthodoxy, the administration was fixated on test prep for the regents exams. Their approach was a lock-step regimen centered on rote learning. The class period was strictly broken down into specific blocks of time for certain activities—none of which fostered critical thinking and most of which sucked any joy in learning the material that students may have had outside of the classroom. What struck me most was the absolute certainty with which the administration, and a core group of faculty members, wielded this orthodoxy like missionaries with Bibles. There was the KIPP way and that was it. I was fortunate in that my friend was the dean of academics by this time, which shielded me to a certain extent from the worst of it. The principal of the high school was not yet 30 years old, and had taught middle school English for a handful of years. How this qualified her to lead a high school is a question that any reasonable person would ask. My students were shocked when they learned that I was over 40 years old and a father. They had never been taught by experienced teachers. With its ranks primarily filled by well-meaning but underqualified Teach for America cadres handing out graphic organizers, KIPP touted its students’ test scores as a measure of their academic success. Whether they were actually getting a first-rate education or not is another matter. I left the school in June of 2010. Little did I realize then that my odyssey was just beginning.</p><p>Because I had left KIPP with no position waiting for me else- where, I had to really scramble. There was a hiring freeze at that point in the city’s public schools, so only schools that were considered to be the most distressed were eligible for waivers to get around the freeze. In the end (over Labor Day weekend, no less), University Neighborhood High School on the Lower East Side informed me that they had received a waiver to offer me a position. I was thrilled. It felt so good to be back in the New york City public school system where i had started my career. The school was located in a beautiful, if worn, old Beaux-Arts-style building built in 1903. Originally, it housed p.s. 31, which had educated the neighborhood’s elementary-age children for decades. In the 1960s, the nearby Seward Park High School annexed the building to house its overflow student population. This was the school that author Frank McCourt had taught at for a number of years before coming to teach at Stuyvesant. As it was in his day, UNHS (the successor school to Seward Park Annex) was a very diverse, low-performing school. Fights were common—between both male and female students—and there were days when I spent the entire class period just trying to get students to behave and be respectful of each other. There were other days when great things were happening in the classroom. In fact, one of my best memories as a teacher was an Athens/Sparta debate I held with a class full of students who had failed the Global History Regents exam and were preparing to take it again. The analytical thinking, the quick thinking, and the sheer joy of learning that were evident throughout the classroom made all the tough times worth it. The administration, headed by a veteran math teacher, was very supportive, and I was more than happy to help in any way I could. But slowly things changed. The external pressures placed on the school, because it was labelled “SINI” by the state, meant that the administration was running scared trying to stay one step ahead of ex-Mayor Bloomberg’s school closure “chopping block.” The same oppressive orthodoxy that had permeated KIPP began to be felt at UNHS. It was sad because even though it was a tough school, there was some good teaching going on there. By my second year, room for any kind of individuality or differences in approach to teaching was discouraged. My classroom was the last one to be altered, but altered it was. Based on my conception of what teaching is, by the end, I was actually teaching in only one of my classes (a single section of AP). In my other four classes, anyone could have handed out the worksheets that I was handing out and taken attendance. I had become superfluous. Maybe that was the intention of the “reformers.”</p><p>There’s one interesting anecdote that is worth reciting here, because I feel it sheds a clarifying light on what is wrong with the charter school model (whether it’s actual brick & mortar charter schools like KIPP or simply the charter approach that has been forced on low-performing public schools). In 2011, when I realized how UNHS was going to change, I interviewed for a position at the Dwight Englewood School in New Jersey. Dwight Englewood is an elite private school just across the George washington Bridge from New york. Its student body is drawn from well-to-do families on either side of the Judson River. it was clear at the end of my interview that I was close to being offered a position. And then they asked me about KIPP. I told them that i hadn’t been enamored with many of the ways that the school was operated or funded, but most importantly that the students were not encouraged to think critically, that this had been the deal-breaker for me. To my relief at the time, the high school principal said that this was exactly Dwight Englewood’s take on KIPP. Over the years, KIPP had tried to place its middle school graduates at the school, and they had all been turned down because in interviews, there was clearly something missing in their make up as students. He offered me the position. Ultimately, I turned it down because I felt that I was in the front line trenches of the new school wars in the city and that this was a chance to be part of history (maybe I should have had my head examined). So i stayed at UNHS. Interestingly, during the interview process, I was informed that Dwight Englewood was considering doing away with having their students take standardized exams altogether, that the courses they had were superior to any external curriculum and that the exams had a distorting effect. And parents were lining up to get their children into this school! What is it exactly that schools like Dwight Englewood know that charter school advocates don’t know? This is an important question.</p><p>How does the odyssey end? Well, Ms. Dunkel had a baby. A position opened here at Stuyvesant, and I jumped at the chance to come back to where it all started for me back in 1995. Teachers and students at this school are lucky. Real teaching and learning goes on in classrooms here. This isn’t the case in most charter schools and low-performing public schools, with their emphasis on test prep. I’m grateful every day I walk across the footbridge and through the doors of Stuyvesant. I have to admit though, that I wish all teachers teaching in the city’s public schools felt this way. They should. That so many don’t is a damning indictment of the obsession with test prep, “accountability,” and data that has permeated the system. It’s also an indictment of the demoralizing effect placing responsibility for larger societal ills on the shoulders of veteran teachers has had. NYU education historian, Diane Ravitch—once a supporter, and now a fierce opponent, of charter schools—quoted W.E.B. Du Bois in her latest book, “Reign of Error,” regarding this issue:</p><p><center><i>“No school, as such, can organize industry, or settle the matter of wage and income, can found homes or furnish parents, can establish justice or make a civilized world.”</i></center></p><hr><p><i>*“Knowledge is Power Program.” Founded in houston, Texas in 1994 by two Teach for America alumni.</i></p><p><i>*“School in need of improvement.”</i></p><p><i>*KIPP receives generous - nancial assistance from the wal- ton Foundation (the wal-mart fortune), the Gates Foundation, and the Broad Foundation: all of which use their great wealth to shape policy. in accepting fund- ing from such institutions, Kipp is in no way out of the ordinary for charter schools.</i></p>	104	13	\N	2014-04-25 07:07:58.369	2017-12-08 03:15:24.001582	2	1	
310	﻿Business Update: Severe Coffee Price Increases Cause Panic	business-update-severe-coffee-price-increases-cause-panic	<p>Coffee prices from vendors around Stuyvesant have seen a severe increase: the average price of a 12-oz hot coffee has shot up 327 percent to $4.30 as of December 20.</p><p><b>A Global Coffee Shortage? </b></p><p>Coffee vendors are insistent that they have simply run out of coffee supplies.</p><p>“After several weeks of exhaustive coffee consumption at Stuyvesant, global coffee supply has dwindled dangerously,” Starbucks executive chairman Howard Schultz explained. “In our sources in Brazil, sub-saharan Africa, and Indonesia, discontent growers have balked at the extreme production requirements that Stuyvesant students have imposed. They know how high demand is, and now, they’re charging a premium.”</p><p>When pressed on why only the Chambers Street branch has seen such severe price increases, Schultz declined to comment. A similar response was given by other coffee vendors frequented by Stuyvesant students.</p><p>A document was recently uncovered documenting a cartel between 17 major coffee outlets around Stuyvesant. However, according to independent analyst Howie Stultz, this is likely “a mere prank from students.”</p><p><b>The Toll on Students</b></p><p>Students are the main victims.</p><p>Some students have continued purchasing coffee despite the now eye-watering costs. “My favorite frap is now $9.90, but you only live once, right?” senior Steve Wong remarked.</p><p>Thrifty students have created an app that tracks coffee prices at specific vendors. The price of coffee at different vendors has become very much volatile as a result of constantly increasing prices. Just this morning, there was a $0.45 difference between Starbucks and the coffee cart before the coffee cart updated its price at 7:43 AM.</p><p>Other students have resorted to secretly making coffee at home. These are primarily students who consume over 10 cups a day; they purchase more coffee once they reach Stuyvesant to escape their parents’ indignation. One anonymous student professed to using instant simply because it was easier to hide.</p><p>Some festive students have given up on coffee, instead consuming non-alcoholic eggnog. Regrettably, eggnog has completely failed at keeping students alert. One eggnog-crazed senior is peacefully asleep and is projected to stay asleep past the New Year.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 22:47:54.574784	5	1	
311	﻿Trump Challenged to IQ Test with Senior Eugene Thomas	trump-challenged-to-iq-test-with-senior-eugene-thomas	<p>Senior Eugene Thomas was so distraught after receiving a test score in BC calculus that he challenged President Trump to an IQ test.</p><p>“You don’t understand. My 98.31415926 GPA will be permanently marred by the 96 I’m going to receive in this class,” argued Thomas. “It’s not my fault Mr. Cocoros only lets students bump their tests to a maximum of 92 with retakes.” At this point, he broke down in tears.</p><p>Thomas’s challenge was quickly spread throughout the Internet and caught the president’s attention. Trump replied via Twitter, “Yet another example of the liberal elite thinking that I’m stupid and that everyone else is beneath them. I accept your challenge, but we all know who’s going to WIN.” Thomas was slated to arrive at the White House on December 15.</p><p>In the meantime, Thomas prepared for the test. He studied old IQ tests. He memorized the cubic and quartic formulas (and their derivations), as well as the proofs for the existence of the distance and incompleteness theorems. He also made sure to memorize the entirety of all of the translations available of “War and Peace.”</p><p>The IQ test itself seemed to go as planned. Coverage aired on C-SPAN, which garnered the most viewers in the 18-49 demographic in the channel’s history. The two took to opposite sides of the Oval Office. Thomas finished in 17 minutes and 32 seconds, but patiently waited for the next hour for the president to finish.</p><p>The results, however, were not released to the public. When questioned about it on December 16, Trump yelled, “The test was rigged,” and then ranted for thirty minutes.</p><p>Later that evening, Trump tweeted, accusing Thomas of cheating. He wrote, “Obstructionist liberals are so afraid of losing and so dishonest that they insist on cheating. Sad! The American people will find out the truth!”</p><p>Shortly after, Trump tweeted again, announcing a second round: “While my wonderful staff is recounting the results of the tests, I’ve decided that we should have a second round, just for good measure. I’ve been practicing eighth dimension chess for the test anyway, so I’ll win again!”</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 13:17:12.160237	5	1	
400	﻿The Original Twenty-One Pilots, A Deeply Buried Secret	the-original-twenty-one-pilots-a-deeply-buried-secret	<p>The Stuyvesant Theater Community’s production of Arthur Miller’s classic play, “All My Sons,” directed by senior Mika Simoncelli, sophomore Emily Rubinstein, and freshman Clara Yuste, opens on Joe Keller (senior Alex Whittington) sitting in a lawn chair, reading the newspaper in front of a blue house with yellow windows, a simple white fence, and flowers on the windowsill. The picture-perfect suburban house conjures up the familiarity of the American Dream. But we soon discover that the people inside that house, two parents, their son, and the fiancée of their son who went missing in the war, are anything but serene. They’re each broken, keeping secrets that they’re either too ashamed of or too disturbed by to tell even those who are closest to them.</p><p>Joe’s son Larry, a pilot in the war, has been missing for three years, leaving behind a broken family and distraught fiancée. Joe has to suffer through the consequences of the choices he made in order to keep his business running and to make money for his family, even if those choices mean he is responsible for the deaths of 21 pilots, and that somehow, his son could have been one of them.</p><p>From the opening moment, Whittington remains brilliantly committed to his role as Joe, an aging suburban businessman with a dark secret. Sophomore Zeynep Bromberg is lively and honest as Joe’s wife, Kate Keller. Kate refuses to believe that Larry is dead, because she knows that if he is, it’s Joe’s fault, and she’s incapable of accepting the fact that a father can kill his own son.</p><p>Between a series of small panic attacks and a lot of social manipulation, Kate struggles to prevent Larry’s beautiful fiancée Ann Deever (sophomore Victoria Wong) from marrying her living son Chris (senior Garrett Hall), knowing that their marriage would force her to accept the unthinkable. Kate grasps at Larry’s memory from the people around her, even believing her neighbor Frank Lubey’s (senior Travis Tyson) “horoscope” for Larry proves that he must still be alive somewhere. Bromberg reveals Kate’s pain when she says, of other mothers like her, “They don’t say it on the radio, but I’m sure that in the dark of night they’re still waiting for their sons.”</p><p>The play’s heavy-handed moralizing provides the thread of the plot. While Kate believes Larry must be alive because it’s immoral for a father to have killed his own son, Joe justifies his actions and lies with his own moral compass, saying that nothing in the world is bigger or more important than the relationship between father and son. Therefore, nothing should compromise his relationship with Chris.</p><p>Chris, meanwhile, clearly thinks it wrong to disrespect or distance oneself from one’s parents, but right to marry someone that you love, regardless of the circumstances. That idea goes head-to-head with Kate’s belief that a fiancée should wait for her fiancé unconditionally if he goes missing, and that she should certainly not marry his brother.</p><p>The supporting roles did their part to give the heavy storyline life and energy. Beginning with her funny, energetic entrance as eight-year-old Bert, sophomore Sara Stebbins provided comedic relief. An added laugh came when Ann commented that Frank was losing his hair, because Travis Tyson, with his voluminous head of hair, was playing the part.</p><p>Hall and Wong’s chemistry as Chris and Ann, who become engaged during the play without Kate’s knowledge or Joe’s enthusiasm, provided a framework for most of the scenes, and their kiss drew a substantial reaction from the audience. The direction skillfully brought to light the recognizable story of young love amid the backdrop of a serious setting.</p><p>The cast glided effortlessly through the minor sound inconsistencies typical of student productions, displaying true professionalism. The four neighbors, often emerging from opposite sides of the stage throughout the play, added to the almost eerie American dream illusion.</p><p>On one side of the house, Sue Bayliss (freshman Mimi Gillies) agonizes over her husband’s (sophomore Michael Dekhtyar) desire to sacrifice his career as a doctor to devote his life to scientific research. Much like her neighbor Kate, she shifts abruptly from the typical well-mannered suburban housewife to someone frighteningly controlling and manipulative. Her unbridled desperation to keep her husband Jim in a financially stable career at the cost of his dreams, and the fact that she is willing to force Ann to make Chris leave town in order to prevent him from inspiring Jim too much suggest that she, like Joe, harbors a greedy obsession with money and success.</p><p>Adding to the grim undertone of the play is the tree stump placed to one side of the Kellers’ lawn. It is, we find out early on in the play, all that remains of a tree planted in Larry’s memory. It blew down in a storm the previous night—the very night that Ann came to visit. Kate sees that as a cosmic sign that Larry is still out there somewhere, alive and trying to come home. The stump spurs her determination to keep any of her friends and family members from forgetting about Larry or treating him as dead. She slips into a sort of mania, constantly directing thinly-veiled insults and tests at Annie, to Chris’s annoyance.</p><p>The idea of an ordinary man accidentally killing his own son by shipping out defective plane parts is surreal. Yet the way it destroys the lives of a bunch of ordinary people feels all too real and haunting, even today.</p><p>Chris, the dreamer craving true love and inspiration, learns to be practical. The sweet, innocent housewife, starts losing her mind. The man who killed 21 innocent young men wove a web of lies among the people closest to him and put his business partner in prison, all to live an ideal, stable life alongside his family. The man who deludes himself into thinking that he was innocent—that his remarkably selfish actions were justified—walks only feet away from his wife, son, and twice soon-to-be daughter-in-law and puts a bullet in his own head.</p><p>“All My Sons” is a challenging play to take on. It deals with grave themes and tackles profound ideas surrounding the innate evil in humanity through subtle interactions between characters. Only actors who have committed themselves to their parts, and to the story itself, can do the play justice, and STC successfully tackled the challenges of this material, building an engaging, moving performance.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:47:33.434117	2018-01-23 02:47:33.580131	21	1	Review of the STC winter drama <i>All My Sons</i>.
402	﻿There is More Than What Meets the Eye in “The Greatest Showman”	there-is-more-than-what-meets-the-eye-in-the-greatest-showman	<p>Fans said goodbye to the Barnum and Bailey Circus, otherwise known as “The Greatest Show On Earth,” in May of 2017. The production met its end after a drawn-out battle with animal rights activists and a drop in popularity after the removal of elephants from the performances. While its end was highly publicized, most were unaware of the circus’ initial path to success. Conveniently, this story has integrated itself into popular culture through the film, “The Greatest Showman,” which was released in December of 2017 and directed by Michael Gracey.</p><p>The movie-musical opens to a vibrant scene in a circus tent filled with a diverse group of entertainers performing stunts that include—but are definitely not limited to—stilt walking, horseback riding, and trapeze artistry. The crowd surrounding them shouts with excitement as the camera zeroes in on a man dressed in a bright red jacket and top hat standing in the center of the frenzy. The man is clearly supposed to be P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), who most of us know as the founder of the famed Barnum and Bailey Circus. The two hours that follow tell the story of the circus and Barnum’s rise to popularity and are, of course, jam-packed with uplifting and enthusiastic musical numbers.</p><p>It’s undeniable that “The Greatest Showman” is a visually stunning film. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey’s use of sweeping camera angles and intense close-ups pairs well with the elaborate, richly-colored costumes. A notable outfit was a luminescent white ball gown worn by European singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). The pure white of the dress fits well with the context of the film, as it is worn when Barnum realizes the recognition Lind could bring him and consequently pays less attention to his more eccentrically talented performers.</p><p>However, what takes away from the film’s appeal are the overlooked and problematic aspects of Barnum himself. The movie portrays the circus as a celebration of differences. Barnum takes on the role of a benevolent revolutionary who breaks social norms by offering a place for the outcasts. In reality, Barnum's path to success was most likely less selfless and bordered on exploitative. The film’s glorification of Barnum is demonstrated in its depiction of Charles Stratton (Sam Humphrey), a little person enlisted by Barnum to perform in the circus under the stage name General Tom Thumb. The movie portrays Stratton as a young adult who is insecure about his stature until Barnum teaches him to celebrate his uniqueness. In reality, Stratton was four years old at the time of his employment, but it was stated to the public that he was 11. For performances, Barnum had Stratton smoke cigars and drink wine, which drastically differs from the heroic general character Barnum embodies in the film.</p><p>While I had my doubts about the way Barnum was depicted on screen, I was pleased to see the portrayal of an interracial relationship between Barnum’s right-hand-man Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) and trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). Though they are primarily known for their Disney-related successes, Zendaya and Efron do not disappoint in this feature film. Both actors step up to the plate and deliver emotionally impressive performances and highlight their striking voices in various songs. The pair sing an inspiring duet titled, “Rewrite the Stars,” and over the course of the movie, communicate the message that love goes beyond racial boundaries.</p><p>I was excited to finally see a movie featuring an interracial couple, though I noticed that “The Greatest Showman” could have made more of an effort in terms of race and representation. Barnum has a diverse cast of circus performers, but he and his business partner Carlyle are both portrayed by white actors which, in a way, pushes the performers into the background and makes Wheeler and Carlyle’s relationship seem more like a plot device. Wheeler’s brother, W.D. (Yahya Abdul-Mateen), appears infrequently in the film and has very few lines of dialogue. His lack of prominence does make me wonder if Wheeler’s romance with Carlyle is only incorporated to make the movie seem more aware. While its casting is progressive, it is slightly disheartening to see that every person of color in the film is a part of Barnum’s cast of “oddities.”</p><p>Though its racial inconsistencies are hard to overlook, “The Greatest Showman” does fulfill its ultimate purpose, which is to be a crowd pleaser. The backbone of the film is its score, filled with heartfelt lyrics and catchy melodies. Though the film is set in the 1800s, the soundtrack has a mostly pop feel, which gives the movie a refreshingly modern twist. Its composers, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, have already gained recognition from their work on “Dear Evan Hansen,” the Tony-winning musical, and “La La Land,” the 2016 box-office hit. The well-written music is also complementary to the cast’s powerful voices, notably that of Keala Seattle, who plays bearded lady Lettie Lutz. Seattle, an actress primarily known for her roles on stage, has a powerful presence on film that makes itself known during “This Is Me,” a dynamic ballad about self-acceptance. Another impressive performance was given by Michelle Williams, who draws viewers in as Charity Hallett, Barnum’s free-spirited yet strong-willed wife. Williams’s acting is believable and mature and leaves viewers rooting for her character as she questions Barnum’s devotion to her.</p><p>Over the course of the film, Hugh Jackman proves himself a perfect fit for the lead role of P.T. Barnum, delivering a performance that leaves audiences both rooting for his character, while also questioning his judgement. With his impressive background in musical theater, notably the role of Jean Valjean in the film adaptation of “Les Misérables,” it is clear that Jackman is in his element in every scene in the film.</p><p>If there is one thing that audiences are sure to take away from “The Greatest Showman,” it would indisputably be the film’s message of embracing differences and celebrating them. The movie is well-meaning and family-friendly, but upon closer examination, there are several obvious discrepancies. Especially in light of Barnum and Bailey’s recent downfall, a nod to the circus’ controversial past could help acknowledge the flaws that were part of the production, as well as touch on their continued presence throughout history. The film is sure to entertain, but with its questionable representation and glossed over evidence, it is certainly more likeable when viewed through a rose-tinted lens.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:49:24.904225	2018-01-23 02:49:25.057612	13	1	A review of “The Greatest Showman”

Its huge success comes with being the most feminist Star Wars movie to date, while addressing key social themes like maturity and gender roles. “The Last Jedi” does miss a few chances for better character development, but it remains enjoyable for old and new fans alike.</p><p>Being a long-time fan of the franchise himself, director Rian Johnson’s approach to the movie draws much from the previous Star Wars films, with the large-scale space dogfights and lightsaber duels that have made Star Wars so iconic and instantly recognizable. The film opens up featuring the last of a torn Resistance, led by a war-wary General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who reprises her role in the grand finale through a heavy-hitting performance.</p><p>Between documenting the Resistance’s attempts to escape impending First Order wrath, Johnson takes plenty of time to further explore the relationship between Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Viewers get to watch as Rey tries to convince Luke to train her while we learn about the final downfall of the Jedi. Rey’s determination in trying to persuade Luke and her lack of hesitation when she has the chance to help Kylo become good again add to Rey’s personality. She also sets the distinction between Kylo Ren and Ben Solo, with Kylo being a demonous conduit for the Dark Side that kills mercilessly and Ben being the son of Han and Leia, who lost his way because no one seemed to care about him and his achievements as a young adult. Luke is also forced to finally address his role in Ben Solo’s younger life. Through this, we learn that even a Jedi Master like Luke is not unsusceptible to emotions that control how we act, often wrongly.</p><p>This display of emotion is present in many other key characters on screen. Men being emotionally vulnerable is no stranger to the Star Wars universe; It was first seen in Anakin Skywalker and is now seen in almost all the male main characters in the new trilogy. However, Star Wars is also now turning its attention to strengthening female characters. General Organa has more of a speaking role and remains feisty and composed despite personal loss. Rey chooses to see the good in others and rarely gives up unless she has to. The First Order’s Captain Phasma is a symbol of power and discipline in her shining anti-blaster armor. It’s so important that such a far-reaching franchise continues addressing gender roles, when most films overlook female and male empowerment.</p><p>Tied into this is Johnson’s biggest message in “The Last Jedi,” stated blatantly by Ben when he makes a plea for Rey to join him: “Just let go.” It’s seen plaintively throughout the film, when Luke tries letting go of his Jedi origins because of shame of having failed to keep Ben from the Dark Side. Rey has to let go of her obsession with who her parents are so that it doesn’t affect her behavior and bring her more pain. Finn’s exchange with his former First Order mentor is his final goodbye to the Empire’s teachings. In contrast, various other characters experience a plethora of negative emotions because they can’t let go of shame or regretful actions.</p><p>But being the longest Star Wars film to date, it could have easily shed a half hour or used it to explain other issues. Johnson spends too long delving into older Star Wars lore, which Luke seems to brood over constantly and discusses sparingly with Rey. And while Kylo Ren becomes a very complex villain, Captain Phasma, an already powerful non-Force user, has as much of a role as she did in the previous film, which isn’t much. I would also have loved to see more of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), the newest addition to the cast. Rose already displayed her pragmatism, observational ability, and quick wit, but her unlikely rise to heroism would have been all the more engaging with more character development.</p><p>However, not all of the two and a half hours is confusing or negative. Besides recreating the incredibly iconic Star Wars opening theme, film composer John Williams’ music is heard throughout. Unlike earlier episodes, his compositions are heard more frequently and closely reflect what is happening in the movie, like when the brass and percussion start weaving between the higher and lower octaves whenever the power of the Dark Side is on full display. Williams’s film score also does well to arouse the audience’s adrenaline whenever another exciting battle ensues, while being equally able to leave viewers troubled when characters experience loss or pain.</p><p>Viewers are also given the chance to examine characters more intimately with close-ups and medium shots that catch slight changes in facial expression. In scenes like Rey and Ben’s confrontation with the Supreme Leader, the camera captures Rey’s intense fear and sudden doubt in Ben’s goodness. Though his face barely changes, we can see the inner struggle between Ben and Kylo before he reaches a decision.</p><p>We also can’t help but enjoy the qualities of a modern “space Western” as Star Wars has been so affectionately deemed. Having blurred the lines between distinctly good and evil, a final Star Wars feel is returned in a classic Light Side versus Dark Side standoff. The First Order’s vast array of firepower is on full display, while the ever-vigilant Resistance retains its never-ending hope in the face of doom. And then Luke Skywalker comes.</p><p>“The Last Jedi” has been met with great success and it’s not a wonder why. Director Rian Johnson has been able to create a film wholly original while keeping the classicality of Star Wars. Even with the introduction of so many new characters and ideas, the film isn’t rushed and continues to tell a beautifully woven story that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:48:10.260881	2018-01-23 03:08:49.197039	13	5	“The Last Jedi” has been met with such resounding success thanks to its wider-reaching emotional depth and modern viewpoints.

Their first official match was scheduled for Saturday, September 10, against Julia Richman Education Complex, but it was postponed due to the other team’s lack of available players. Unfortunately, the Peglegs’ game against MLKHS resulted in a 4-0 loss.</p><p>The Knights are the defending city-wide champions. In both of their games last year, the Peglegs lost to the Knights 7-0. “We are in a very rough division, having to play Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass Academy [in] four out of 10 games,” coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>During Wednesday’s game, the Knights had the opportunity to launch 13 shots against the Peglegs, who were only able to shoot four.</p><p>After losing six vital seniors from last year, the players are looking to other members of the team to step up in the starting lineup. “Players like [sophomore] Henry Kotkin, [sophomore] Lewis Woloch, and [sophomore] Jeremy Moller will be filling the void last year’s seniors [left]. [Senior] David Power will also be our new starting goalkeeper,” Miller said. Power was able to save eight of the 12 shots at the goal at Wednesday’s game, proving his capabilities.</p><p>Though the Peglegs lost, they proved that they were able to compete against the toughest of opponents. “We plan to make the playoffs this season. That's always our long-term goal,” Miller said. “[I am] confident [the team] will play hard and look to win some of those tough games.”</p><p>As the season goes on, the Peglegs will be looking to improve their finishes and possession in games. “I think we can improve our aggression when going in for tackles and also [work] to keep the ball against high-pressing teams,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzburg said.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 02:14:17.390681	24	1	The Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, kicks off its season with a loss, but are looking for a quick bounce back.
53	﻿Seeds of Peace	seeds-of-peace	<p>The first day of Seeds of Peace was a party. First impressions consisted of smiles, laughs, flailing limbs, and offbeat cheering. As buses rolled in weighed down by kids who had flown thousands of miles from countries most Americans can’t point out on a map, I felt, for the first time in a long time, joy.</p><p>The genius of Seeds of Peace international camp starts off with that first day. Counselors carrying a motley assortment of instruments and noisemakers cheer so loud you can’t quite make out the words. Campers, who have already arrived, form a tunnel with their reaching arms and interlaced fingers. Every camper who runs off the bus runs into an embrace. The support, the joy, the unapologetic dancing, spurs smiles and quick introductions. This initial openness was what made me feel at home from the moment I stepped off the bus.</p><p>Over the course of three and a half weeks, these small connections served as the genesis of relationships that form the foundation for Seeds of Peace.</p><p>The Seeds of Peace Camp international session is an international program held in Otisfield, Maine every summer for three and a half weeks from late June to late July. Journalist John Wallach and Program Developer Bobbie Gottschalk founded Seeds of Peace in 1993, the same year as the Oslo Accords attempted and failed to establish a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine.</p><p>Since its inception, Seeds has brought Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian, and American youth (or “seeds”) to Maine in order to facilitate meaningful dialogue between youth on the opposing sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In recent years, Seeds has also established a South Asian program, including seeds from India and Pakistan to discuss the conflict between their countries.</p><p>At Seeds, next to the beautiful Pleasant Lake in Maine, you eat, sleep, play sports, and make music like any other American summer camp. However, you do this while engaging in camp activities where you talk to, learn from, and make friends with people whose experiences, ideology, and cultural sensibilities may be markedly different from yours.</p><p>In a bunk of ten boys, Indians share a bathroom with Pakistanis. At a table, Jews share a meal with Muslims. One of the immediate and striking components of the camp is the unspoken and gratuitous acceptance of diversity. There is a familiarity that accompanies cohabitation.</p><p>Part of every day was spent in dialogue. Groups of campers would make their way to dialogue huts, each with two trained facilitators. Tasked with discussing conflicts, that for many campers, are an ever-present and ugly component of their daily lives, seeds embark on a prodigious and often painful mission of understanding, of communication, and of comprehension, unfettered by bigotry or stereotype.</p><p>Every day campers would walk out of their dialogue huts sometimes frustrated and drained, but also absurdly yet understandably happy that someone from the other side of the conflict had heard them and listened.</p><p>“Trust the process” they told us in dialogue. And I did. While at times I was doubtful of what we were doing, I trusted the people I spent my entire day with. In my South Asian dialogue, we talked about equity and equality, about terrorism, about Kashmir, about Islam.</p><p>I listened as one of my best friends struggled to defend her religion and we cried together. I listened at night as my bunkmate told me stories about bombs and checkpoints and soldiers. Listening was central to my experience both in dialogue and in camp in general.</p><p>Unlike The Palestinians or Israelis, I have no direct stake in the conflict. Instead I sought to understand the experiences that informed each camper’s opinions, how each camper moved, existed, and understood structures and systems to help make sense of the world around them. A Muslim camper explained to me that while she believed her religion to be morally right in every aspect, humans are prone to fallacy and misinterpretation. We had entire dialogues spent discussing whether Muslim terrorists are actually Muslim. I became friends with a Catholic Palestinian girl who has to drive hours to the nearest town with a church every Sunday. I met a camper from the Gaza Strip who described it as Hell.</p><p>I trusted the process. I spent hours in the lake staring out at the mountains. I spent hours in my bunk at night using the dim light of my iPod to help illuminate the process of my thoughts becoming words as I wrote in my journal. I argued, I sang in the shower, I witnessed Muslims unroll their prayer mats in the direction of Mecca and prostrate themselves at night. I unpacked everything and saw the beauty and importance in the struggle of what we were doing.</p><p>I spent hours listening to people talk about their lives, their hopes, and fears. I had the realization over and over again that the worlds the other campers lived in were so far removed from mine, that I truly live in a bubble; to understand their experiences, I had to transcend prejudices that I didn’t even realize I had.</p><p>I played sports, I played music, I wrote poetry, I listened to poetry, I found spaces to discuss issues and thoughts about race and oppression and roots I never realized I had opinions about. As cheesy as it sounds, I tried to live in the moment, to be present, and to see people beyond their opinions or words.</p><p>For every tear shed or chair thrown in a dialogue hut, there were countless moments of simple humanity and friendship. I talked with an Egyptian girl about why she no longer wears shorts in public. I wrote poetry with a Jewish-American girl who found herself becoming increasingly pro-Palestine as camp progressed. I listened to Pakistani music and talked to another Egyptian girl about the SAT. I walked past the lake sandwiched between two of my best friends at camp: an Israeli and a Palestinian. I constantly asked myself, “What is happening here?”</p><p>With no phones for three and a half weeks, all we were left with were thoughts and ideas. “Be raggedy,” they told us. To be raggedy means to be unafraid to give voice to ideas that you may not have the right words for, but that hold truth. And, being raggedy was cleansing. Once I exposed myself for the world to see, my ideas and beliefs were shaped and strengthened by the crucible of constant questioning.</p><p>I talked to a Muslim boy who was homophobic as a result of his never having been exposed to queerness. I asked him why he thought what he thought. He told me and I disagreed, but I understood what informed his beliefs, and I saw the person as separate from the opinions.</p><p>It’s hard to believe all this happened in three and a half weeks. Looking back, I think of it as a lifetime. A lifetime broken into moments during which I grew years. A lifetime broken into entire hours, entire conversations spent trying to search for that one tiny shared truth that would allow us to truly understand one another. To remember who you were going into an experience, and to see that the person coming out of it is completely different, is a truly humbling realization.</p><p>It’s impossible to say whether Seeds of Peace will ever accomplish its underlying purpose of one day solving the Israeli-Palestinian and Indian-Pakistani conflicts. In fact, talking to many seeds as camp drew to an end, it seemed that many had confirmed and strengthened the beliefs they came to camp with. When viewed in the context of a world that is becoming increasingly polarized, where political views have become progressively more synonymous with morality and decency, when conflict seems ever more prevalent in our lives, Seeds of Peace is failing its original mission.</p><p>However, even those who left Seeds feeling more righteous in their opinions, who believe with assiduous conviction that their side has the moral high-ground, have spent three weeks living and creating a shared space with the other side. Even those who will go back to their country to join the army, playing an active role in the conflict, know those they are fighting as people. Even those who experience conflict daily know how to use their words and ideas productively, or at least cathartically, as an alternative to violence.</p><p>I'm still in the process of trying to unpack and explore the ways in which camp has changed me. I still have yet to cauterize some of the wounds it has opened. I struggle to keep in touch with friends living in different time zones. I now try to keep up with news from seven different countries. I have to worry about friends who live in active conflict zones, who have to navigate checkpoints and soldiers.</p><p>I have to come to terms with living in a country that is increasingly candid about not wanting me. I have to watch as people kill and hate and dehumanize others. Everywhere I look, I see situations where the one thing lacking is dialogue.</p><p>One concrete thing Seeds has given me is conviction: I want to bring this space into a world with so many opinions and so little listening.</p><p>As the Persian poet Rumi wrote, and social justice activists often quote: “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field, I’ll meet you there.”</p><p>With Seeds, I found the field.</p>	108	2	f	2017-09-29 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 05:21:32.725343	9	1	
196	Mr. Polazzo: Preparing Stuyvesant Students to Think	mr-polazzo-preparing-stuyvesant-students-to-think	<p>Hidden in the corner of the Student Union (SU) room is a tiny office with two comfortable couches and a wall covered with a collage of family vacation photos. Government teacher and Coordinator of Student Affairs Matt Polazzo and his family smile down in frozen moments. To the right of his desktop, there are portrait photos of his government students last year and their quotes regarding his class. As I sit down on his couch to begin the interview, SU Vice President Alexa Valentino approaches Polazzo’s office and asks if he has any concerns about the open house event that is going to happen later that day. Polazzo responds,  “Alexa, do you think there is anything more you want to do? If everything is going well, I am confident the open house should run smoothly.”</p><p>Around Stuyvesant,  Pollazo is seen as an intellectual character that works as a strong facilitator, overseeing the SU in general and supervising all major SU events such as SING!. In addition, he challenges the construct of political thought in the classroom. Pollazo has been a teacher at Stuyvesant for 17 years, during which he has taught different levels of social studies.  He is currently teaching Western Political Theory and  US Government, and he will teach Comparative Government in the Spring.</p><p>Polazzo grew up in New York City and attended Saint Ann’s, a small private school in Brooklyn from seventh to 12th grade. The environment of the school was the opposite of Stuyvesant. “The school was very funky, where we called teachers by their first names, and I had 70 kids in my whole graduating class. There were no grades, just written comments,” he said.</p><p>From there, he went to Bowdoin College and obtained a Masters degree in Political Science and decided to become social studies teacher.</p><p>He was the son of an economics teacher at Brooklyn Technical High School. “Growing up, I always thought teaching was a cool profession, but I didn’t know if I wanted to make a life out of it,” Polazzo said.</p><p>After college, he signed up for a program called Teach for America that took high-performing educators and put them in under resourced schools. He was placed at I.S.143 in Washington Heights, where he taught social studies to sixth to eighth graders. Unlike Stuyvesant, I.S. 143 had a largely Dominican student body. “[I strived to be] the teacher I always to wanted to have—approachable and excited about the material,” Polazzo said.</p><p>However, Polazzo didn’t get along with the administration. “I preferred a more student-centered model of learning, and the principal wanted something that to me seemed more rigid and authoritarian,” he said. Polazzo left I.S. 143 after two years of teaching, but he still wanted to continue his teaching career.</p><p>His father knew Assistant Principal of Social Studies Jennifer Suri and suggested that Polazzo apply for a position for a teacher. “I applied because I knew that Stuyvesant was the best school in the city, and I figured it was worth a shot.  I also applied to Brooklyn Tech, and they called me with a job offering 15 minutes after Stuyvesant did.”</p><p>Polazzo applied ambitiously, but after his interview with Suri, he remembered her blatantly telling him, “ It’s a really demanding job, and it’s unlikely that we are going to need you.” Then, on the first day of the 2002-2003 school year,  Polazzo recalled, “[Suri] called me up and said she had a job for me. [At the time,] I was working for a website that was associated with the Conference Board.  It was my job to track down businesses that engaged in socially responsible actions but made money while doing so. I wrote blurbs about them and publicized their good deeds. I quit that job and went on to be a teacher.” But the teacher he was replacing decided to unretire. Later on, around Thanksgiving of 2003, Polazzo replaced a retiring teacher and started working around December of that year, teaching five periods of government classes.</p><p>After teaching government for so long, Polazzo still enjoys the course because government is an important blend of multiple aspects he is interested in: philosophy, economics, and aesthetics. In addition, he enjoys teaching government because there is always something new happening.“In my first years of teaching, the Bush-Gore election was happening, and every day, we would have discussions concerning the controversies of the election. Now, with Trump as President, I have students who I taught years ago, emailing me about impeachment and Constitutional crisis. But in order to declare if something is a Constitutional crisis, you need to understand the Constitution, which I want my students to know,” he explained. The evolving, contemporary questions that students ask stimulate the lessons and structure of government class and Western Political Theory, which focuses on  the teachings of influential Western philosophers.</p><p>For instance, in his Government class, Polazzo acknowledged that he makes the students carry around pocket Constitutions and has them read the document constantly. “We have come to know the strengths and limitations of the document,” he said.“I try to take things [that] seem obscure and boring and strip the mask off and see the power relations that exist underneath it.”</p><p>For example, in one of his class lectures, he talked about congressional staffing. He described the class lecture as something that “seems like a really boring thing to talk about. But when you drill down into the topic, you get to these really interesting questions about how laws can only be written by staffers because the members don’t have time to write laws. However, laws need to be very complicated because government is very complicated. So now, something that seems boring, like congressional staffing, is a matter of a conflict of democratic ideas, because ordinary Americans are unable to read the complicated laws written by congressional staff.”</p><p>Polazzo makes a great effort to explain the deeper issues of government and how they fit into the bigger picture of society as a whole. He often assigns three or four news articles a week based on major debates happening in the country so that students can be aware of current events. He adds on saying, “Recently, we’ve been talking about gun control and the second Amendment after the Last Vegas attack has occurred, the concept of whether or not hate speech exists and whether NFL players or others should respect the flag. If you want to see the constant changing political climate, just open up the New York Times or Breitbart.”</p><p>Western Political Theory, on the other hand, was created by Polazzo. He describes the course as “much more theoretical than the government class. It focuses on the writings of great Western philosophers from Socrates all the way up to Nietzsche.”</p><p>It is important to point out that the majority of Polazzo’s students are juniors and seniors who are paving their lives to higher education and often come from immigrant families and have tremendous pressure to go after high-paying jobs. “I hope my students won’t just sleepwalk into a career where they’re not doing it for the right reasons. Sometimes, on Sunday night, people feel the dread going to school the next day, but I honestly never feel that because I like my job,” he said. “I feel blessed to have the opportunity to come into contact with some of the smartest, most interesting kids in New York City and talk to them in the most pivotal moment in their life. It’s fun to be able to teach young people who tend to be more flexible.”</p><p>Polazzo believes that this generation’s leaders will be Stuyvesant students who are  lifelong learners. “Idealistically, I believe Stuyvesant students should take classes that they thoroughly enjoy. But realistically, students should learn to balance their desire to learn with the need to have a valuable outcome,” he says. “As for advice about life, well that’s hard. Lots of scientific research and personal experience lets us know that to really lead a good life, it is important to maximize on exposure to things you find enjoyable, like spending time on family [and] friends and having amazing experiences and not focus on the acquisition of physical items but still have enough to provide for yourself.”</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 00:21:32.237137	3	1	Matt Polazzo’s perspective on being a Stuyvesant teacher for 17 years.
54	Writing Center Moved to Room 615F	writing-center-moved-to-room-615f	<p>The Writing Center has been moved from the library to room 615F, following a joint decision by Principal Eric Contreras, Assistant Principal of English Eric Grossman, the English department, and the librarians.</p><p>The decision to relocate the Writing Center was made to make the library a quieter place to study. “It was tricky to have two separate entities running in the same space when different rules apply to each,” said English teacher Holly Schechter, who runs the writing center.</p><p>Room 615F is located just down the hall from the library and is adjacent to Grossman’s office. The room used to serve as a storage closet that was only accessible through the neighboring room 615E, but has since had a proper doorway cut out, connecting it to the hall. The new writing center still needs some refurbishment.</p><p>Many students and teachers believe that this change is beneficial. “The change of location will hopefully bring more students in because there will be no more confusion related to waiting on the library line,” student editor and junior Julia Arancio said.</p><p>Schechter agreed, and said, “Having our own space is a giant step forward for the Writing Center.  It legitimizes the important work we are doing.”</p><p>The Writing Center will remain open from fourth to eighth period and will have student teachers and volunteers working alongside Schechter. “We have a strong team of five student teachers and twenty students, selected by application, who devote their free time to helping other students with their writing,” Schechter said.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 20:11:35.437443	1	1	The writing center has moved from the library to room 615F.
19	﻿Teens and Ballet : A Work In Progress	teens-and-ballet-a-work-in-progress	<p>Sitting down in a plush velvet seat in the upper rows of Lincoln Center, I resigned myself to two hours of confusion and boredom. The possibility that I could enjoy the ensuing ballet seemed remote at best. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The ballet, “Whipped Cream,” was a joyous but intense adventure of a boy trying to evade an evil, giant, doll-like bobble-head doctor set against the backdrop of a whimsical candyland. To my great surprise, “Whipped Cream” hooked me from the get-go with its elements of humor, stunning choreography, and magical costumes that seemed to come alive to Strauss’s music.</p><p>Though I had taken ballet for several years as a child and appreciated the difficulty of the dance, before watching “Whipped Cream,” I had dismissed ballet as an incomprehensible art form accessible only to old, rich people in ballgowns and tuxedos. My friends shared my opinion—they knew they didn’t like ballet because it was “boring,” but didn’t really know why. Ballets aren’t a part of teen culture the way other theater forms like plays or musicals are. We play songs from musicals on repeat even without watching the show (“Hamilton,” anyone?), but we’d be hard-pressed to name more than two ballets and their composers.</p><p>This is dismal in New York City, which offers a world of options: Lincoln Center, New York City Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, and many more. Tickets, compared to other forms of entertainment, are fairly cheap—ballet tickets for students can be bought for as little as $20 or $30 while Broadway tickets routinely go for hundreds of dollars. This phenomenon stems in part from a lack of exposure to ballet. Elementary school children put on yearly plays and musicals, slowly but surely absorbing show culture as part of their education. Ballet, on the other hand, is not seen as relevant to children and is therefore neglected. “The only time I was exposed to a classical ballet was [in] Music Appreciation class,” junior Jennifer Lee commented. “We know [ballets] exist, but they’re just not mainstream with most kids.”</p><p>Lack of exposure only accounts for part of the problem—even those who dance ballet as teens don’t watch it. “Only the girls who are serious about ballet watch [ballets], and just for famous ballerinas,” Masha Yepishkina, 16, added. “For them, it’s like going to see your favorite artist at a concert, but most people, like me, don’t know ballerinas.” Yepishkina, who has four years of experience at Brighton Ballet Theater, thinks ballet’s lack of popularity lies with the perceptions that surround it.</p><p>“I think that a lot of the reason teens aren’t into ballet is because it’s seen as an art form that excludes them,” Haley Henderson suggested. She is 15 and has been practicing ballet on and off for 10 years. Henderson feels that teenagers don’t see themselves and their values represented in the traditionalism and strictness of ballet. There is little diversity in ballet—ballet dancers are typically white with slim, perfectly proportioned bodies and long limbs. However, important strides have been made: Misty Copeland became the first black principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater in 2015. Her performances drew large crowds, diverse in age and race.</p><p>Along with representation, teenagers are also more attracted to ballets with flashy dynamic action, loud sounds, strange characters, frightening plot twists, and scandalous love triangles. It is not a coincidence that “Whipped Cream,” which featured all of these elements, attracted a significantly younger audience. This need for drama comes from a shortened attention span in our digital age. A Microsoft Corp. study found that today, people, particularly younger generations, lose concentration after eight seconds, as opposed to 12 seconds in the year 2000. Classical ballets, characterized by murky, often confusing plotlines and classical music, clash with our desire for quick and easy consumption of information. Songs and dances become popular because they are simple and catchy, while ballet requires thought from the viewer that teenagers often aren’t willing to provide.</p><p>Yet in ballet’s complexity lies its value, and teenage interest in and appreciation of ballet are essential to its preservation. The way to attract teens to ballet is for ballet to tiptoe along the thin line between art and entertainment, integrating the beauty and simplicity of ballet with teen values of rebellion and uniqueness. Teenagers need to see themselves reflected in ballet through more dynamic ballets and more diverse dancers. They also need to learn to connect with ballet early on, a job that falls on parents and educators. Schools need to expand their arts curriculum: school trips should include ballets as well as plays. As for teens, go see a ballet some time—you might be surprised.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:53:46.718234	28	1	Why are ballets not a part of teen culture?
59	﻿A Semper-ternal Beginning	a-semper-ternal-beginning	<p>Posted on stairwells and on walls throughout the school are messages of clubs seeking out fresh faces, new names, and raw talent. Among the mix of different vocal groups and long-standing clubs is Semper, a newly-formed choral music club led by seniors Grace McManus and Alex Whittington. Behind its unique name are stories that propel the spirit of its members.</p><p>Semper is Latin for “always,” and to Whittington, that word in a language that has transcended time describes music perfectly. “When I discovered choral music, it was this massive collection of the human experience over centuries and even millennia. [Always] defines humanity in a sense. It’s everlasting, it’s sempiternal, it’s ongoing, and I feel like that applies to the music,” he said.</p><p>The members didn’t expect to develop a profound interest in choral music. Coming to Stuyvesant provided the opportunity of taking a chorus class. Whittington and member of the Semper board, senior Milo Rosengard, auditioned together, having been in the same art appreciation class.</p><p>Rosengard has been playing the piano since he was four but didn’t express a serious interest toward singing until he started chorus. “We meet every day, and the caliber of what we sing and the level at which we sing it were a lot higher than anything I had experienced before,” he said. Chorus, now subdivided into the groups Madrigal, Oratorio, and Concert, introduced a greater range of chamber music and singing techniques. Rosengard added, “I was very good at sight-singing and took several advanced theory courses. Being around Ms. [Holly] Hall and Ms. [Liliya] Shamazov definitely helped me improve because not only do they teach right notes and rhythms, they focus on posture and how to project your voice.”</p><p>One of the transformative moments for Whittington was singing Giuseppe Verdi’s Messa de Requiem during the second semester of freshman year. Up until that point, chorus was mainly a way for meeting people. But to be able to sing music that required hours of work on just one measure but ultimately produced an astounding sound was what affected him the most. “I somehow got blessed with this amazing opportunity to perform possibly one of the greatest choral masterpieces that has ever existed. That altered me on an emotional and personal level,” he said. “The sentiments and the feelings that were evoked as a result of me forming a part of the choir that went to Carnegie Hall—that launched me into my fascination with choral music,” he said. It’s amazing how the requiem carried raw human emotions over centuries to inspire people today.</p><p>Before Semper became official, it was just McManus and Whittington performing in subways and plazas. They wanted to extend their passion and what they enjoyed doing to a more publicized and larger community. One memorable recollection was when they sang Verdi’s Dies Irae. They had attempted to condense a four-voice, polyphonic piece into a two-voice piece. The reduction from a full-sized choir to just two people singing might have appeared to others as odd and a bit sad, but in that moment, it was exhilarating.</p><p>Whittington’s passion for music and desire to form a larger community are what motivated him to create Semper. He explained, “It’s definitely become something so near and dear to my heart, as a result of that one experience. I wouldn’t even put a label on it; it’s just something I enjoy doing so much and I love that it’s a part of me. I wanted to extend this feeling to a larger community, and as an individual, I also really like meeting new people and seeing what’s out there.” Every experience mirrored their earlier performances, even if they had to move to where no one could hear them and busy New Yorkers kept on walking.</p><p>As they started to bring in more people, through recruiting chorus members and featuring the club throughout the school, what started out as a recreational activity grew into something more along the lines of a family.</p><p>During auditions, the leaders conducted similar exercises to those done in chorus auditions. Rosengard said, “We looked for good singers. We did scales, arpeggios, and pitch matching where I play a short pattern or melody and the person has to repeat it back.” One exercise, called pitch integrity, was nicknamed “torture” because the singer had to sustain a note while other notes were being sung. Through these rigorous exercises, the board recruited several well-experienced members to kickstart the club off into the new school year.</p><p>Rehearsals would most likely involve sectionals, where the different voice groups would divide and learn their parts of a piece. Tentatively speaking, the group plans on performing at Brookdale Senior Living across the street from Stuyvesant. McManus and Whittington plan on putting together a Christmas program for the holiday season. Whittington revealed, “The Christmas music spans from the more pop songs, like Jingle Bells and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, to traditional Latin songs that have been adapted for the 21st century. The holiday season is one of my favorite times of the year, so we’re trying to create a program that is evocative of sentiments of peace, joy, and renewal.”</p><p>Already, the seniors of the club are fast-forwarding to the future when they will eventually leave for college. There is an inexplicable and mutual understanding among the members that undoubtedly maintains and propels Semper. Whittington said, “I feel like the sense of family and community is something that is ‘always’ or will always last. I’m a senior, and I’m going off to college next year, but I feel like this is something I’ll always keep with me.”</p><p>As for their legacy in Stuyvesant, there is no hint of doubt of what will happen. Taking into account several factors, Rosengard assured, “We’re going to have good people taking over for us when we leave. A significant percentage of the people we sang with before we created Semper is underclassmen. I’m confident that Semper will continue to thrive after we leave Stuy.”</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 20:40:34.838809	3	1	A mix of vocalists perform in subways and on the streets as they spread their love for music.

312	﻿Goodbye Girardi, Hello Boone	goodbye-girardi-hello-boone	<p>Aaron Boone will forever have a place in Yankees lore for his 2003 American League Championship Series (ALCS) game seven walk-off home run against the hated Boston Red Sox. That one hit propelled him to the front page of every New York newspaper and has allowed his name to live on even after his short 54-game stint with the team. Now, 15 years later, he is coming back to the Yankees in a completely different role: manager. To put it lightly, this is a questionable decision; Joe Girardi was an underrated manager who deserved his job, and Boone will have many expectations that I’m not sure he’s capable of achieving.</p><p>As a diehard Yankees fan, I’m all for making this team the best it can be. However, sometimes change is detrimental, especially after coming within one game of a World Series berth. Joe Girardi, the former manager, led this club to the ALCS against the eventual World Series champion Houston Astros and fought hard until the very end. This is the very same Yankees team that, in an ESPN article from last March, had only one out of 35 winning the division or making any noise in the postseason (they ended two games behind Boston in the division, but won the wildcard to make it to the playoffs) according to ESPN analysts; this is the team with the injury-prone pitching staff and the one with the inexperienced lineup. While Girardi cannot take all the credit for his team’s 91-71 finish—outfielder Aaron Judge and pitcher Luis Severino’s breakout are obviously products of their own efforts—Girardi was the mastermind that put the club together. He ran a tight ballclub and let the veterans lead by example for the many younger players. He put pressure on his players to execute, and they followed him. No matter if it was game one or game 162, he coached like it was the playoffs. The fire he brought carried over to the team and kept them focused throughout the season.</p><p>I’m not saying Girardi is without flaws. He elected not to replay a hit-by-pitch that actually hit the knob of the bat of Lonnie Chisenhall in the American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians. That missed call almost doomed the Yankees, as Indians’ shortstop Francisco Lindor hit a grand slam during the next at-bat to shrink the Yankees’s lead to 8-7. Furthermore, he spoke out about catcher Gary Sanchez’s defensive inabilities during the season. This is not something he should be talking to the media about, but rather working with Sanchez on behind the scenes. Going to the press is an easy way to alienate oneself from the club, something Girardi luckily avoided. However, through the controversies, he remained in power of his club and made sure his players gave it their all every game.</p><p>Aaron Boone, meanwhile, has experienced none of this. Coaches and players lead vastly different lives, and Boone has not been in a dugout since the end of his playing career in 2009. Since then, he has worked as an ESPN analyst on “Sunday Night Baseball” and other baseball events. While he has been a part of the game, he has not had any coaching experience. Other options for the position, such as Yankees bench coach Rob Thomson, have at least been in the locker room with the team and know what it takes to succeed. Boone will instead be learning on the fly on a team with much higher expectations than the ones they had entering last season. He will be tasked with continuing the “Baby Bomber” development and living up to the hype surrounding the team. Us Yankees fans believe this group of players is special, and cannot see the plan get derailed because of an incompetent coach.</p><p>For both myself and the Yankees, I hope I will be pleasantly surprised. I hope he is the manager we need that will lead the team to its next golden age after the Core Four of the late 1990s and 2000s. However, as of right now, I can’t see how he’d be an improvement over Girardi. Boone will be taking over from his role at ESPN, a position not remotely related to coaching. Girardi’s steadying influence at the helm of the Yankees over the last 10 years, meanwhile, led teams with varying degrees of talent to a combined 910-710 record, the best in the MLB in that span. He deserved another chance with this team. However, Boone is in, and I truly hope this new position only improves his legacy from the 2003 ALCS. After last season, everyone in baseball will be keeping close tabs on the budding Yankees superteam. Here’s to hoping Aaron can keep them on track for a dynasty.</p><p>[a]alliterative title is a work in progress</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 22:49:47.621492	6	1	Aaron Boone’s hire as the next Yankees manager leaves more questions than answers about the team.
403	﻿Thunder, Death, and Weird Jokes	thunder-death-and-weird-jokes	<p>“Thor: Ragnarok” had a lot to prove as the finale of the Thor trilogy. The first two movies, though well-received, were unsuccessful in dazzling their viewers and are not recognized as popular fan-favorites. “Thor: Ragnarok” was Marvel’s last chance in defining Thor movies as a memorable, spectacular superhero trilogy instead of a collection of three decent movies. To do this, it had to be bold and thrilling, and its plot both complex and of a scale large enough to be fitting for a movie named after the end of the world in Norse mythology.</p><p>The film, directed by Taika Waititi, revolves around Thor (Chris Hemsworth), god of thunder, and his quest to stop his older sister and goddess of death, Hela (Cate Blanchett), from conquering his kingdom Asgard and the universe. Along the way, he is captured and held captive in Sakaar by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who forces him to participate in his gladiatorial contest. There, Thor collaborates with his stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), his new friend Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and his old fellow Avenger Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), or the Hulk, to escape Sakaar and defeat Hela.</p><p>The greatest aspect of “Thor: Ragnarok” is its cast. The actors manage to add depth to characters that are generally portrayed as one-dimensional.</p><p>Hemsworth chooses to emphasize Thor’s vulnerability that results from his dependence on his magic hammer, Mjolnir, to feel worthy, instead of focusing on his tough side. This emphasis lets Hemsworth portray Thor’s character growth in becoming a leader who is confident enough to step up to protect the people of Asgard more effectively.</p><p>Hiddleston manages to keep Loki’s status as the most complex and interesting villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He constantly switches Loki’s demeanor from friendly to devious and back, almost as if he is choosing to convey Loki as two different characters: a teammate and a foe. This creates confusion, among the viewers as well as the characters within the film, regarding his true nature.</p><p>The juxtaposition of the Grandmaster’s jokester personality and malice, shown through his willingness to force innocents to fight to the death for entertainment, is hard to pull off. Nevertheless, Goldblum depicts the Grandmaster as humorous, but not too campy—dangerous, but not too one-note. Thompson’s combination of Brunnhilde’s grief over the loss of her fellow Valkyrie and strength as a female lead gives her character a lot of unexpected depth.</p><p>Yet, despite its flashy action scenes, stellar cast performances, and vivid cinematography reminiscent of retro sci-fi fantasy, “Ragnarok” feels less like a superhero film and more like a comedy.</p><p>Its comedic moments never fail in getting a laugh out of the viewer and arguably makes “Thor: Ragnarok” the most fun movie of the Marvel franchise.</p><p>One such example of a comedic moment is the use of the “get help” strategy, where Thor rushes in frantically while supporting a supposedly injured Loki, yelling “Get help! Please! My brother’s dying!” before throwing Loki to bowl over a group of enemy guards. Despite the serious discussion about their relationship as brothers preceding this moment, the very fact that Thor chooses to throw his brother, and the contrast of Loki’s humiliation and Thor’s jubilation that follows, come together to form a scene that is impossible not to find at least somewhat amusing.</p><p>Waititi uses other formulas similar to this throughout the film in order to guarantee that viewers find humor in scenes he designates to be comical.</p><p>But the extremity of this comedic tone causes all attempts of seriousness to fall flat.</p><p>Korg (Taika Waititi), an ally Thor made on Sakaar, represents one aspect of the film’s biggest flaw. Korg’s only purpose in the movie is to provide comic relief. Aside from that, he has no character development and does not do much to influence the plot. The fact that a character like Korg, whose role is purely to serve as comic relief, is a main character of the film only further serves to make the jocularity of the film so great that it cancels out all the film’s solemnity.</p><p>Another aspect of this flaw is Waititi’s habit to follow any moment with potential to have a great emotional impact with humor. The viewer sees this with Bruce Banner’s decision to sacrifice his very identity in order to let the Hulk take over and help the people in ways Banner cannot in the final battle.</p><p>Ruffalo does an excellent job showing Banner’s inner conflict of his fear of the Hulk taking permanent control of his being and his feelings of duty as a former Avenger. However, Waititi chooses to turn his final decision into a punchline by having him initially fail to transform, which causes Banner to crash-land onto the bridge in front of two armies. The resulting secondhand embarrassment the viewer experiences creates hilarity, which takes away the gravity behind Banner’s preceding determination and gives it less of an emotional impact on the viewer.</p><p>Thor’s decision to initiate Ragnarok in order to summon Surtur, the only being that could defeat Hela, even though this meant the land of Asgard would be destroyed, could also have had greater weight. Thor’s claim that “Asgard is not a place, it’s a people” is meant to justify his willingness to give up the well-being of the land in favor of the well-being of that land’s people.</p><p>Yet after leaving Asgard to be destroyed by Surtur, Korg mentions that he had accidentally stepped on his best friend Miek, which would have been considered a much more serious concern had he not said it so nonchalantly. When Miek wakes up a few seconds after he says this, Korg exclaims, “Oh, wait! Miek’s alive!” with a much too delighted tone regarding the circumstances.</p><p>Waititi’s attempt to lighten the mood right after the most destructive event of the film is the most prominent example of how “Thor: Ragnarok” is unwilling to darken its tone by any amount, even if darkening the tone could have elevated its status from a simple comedy to an outstanding superhero movie.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:50:44.527587	2018-01-23 02:50:44.658642	13	1	“Thor: Ragnarok” is blessed with a phenomenal cast and eye-catching action scenes and cinematography, but it's quality is hindered by its inability to uphold a serious tone.
306	﻿“Murder on the Orient Express” Reaches Beyond Its Inspiration	murder-on-the-orient-express-reaches-beyond-its-inspiration	<p>I must admit I had my reservations while walking into the movie theater showing of “Murder on the Orient Express.” I had only recently read, and loved, the Agatha Christie novel which was adapted for the movie. Not only did I fear being disappointed by the film adaption, notoriously inferior to books, but I also worried that knowing the ending of a murder mystery might ruin the film. Considering the novel’s well-deserved infamy, I was curious as to how the film version, directed by Kenneth Branagh—who also stars as the lead, Detective Hercule Poirot—would handle filling Christie’s big shoes.</p><p>It seems that Branagh accounted for this, however, by opening the film with an entirely original scene set in the bustling and colorful city of Jerusalem. The film uses these few minutes, absent from Christie’s novel, to establish its protagonist as a ridiculous perfectionist with an obsession for balance and a rigid belief in the division between right and wrong.</p><p>Detective Poirot is first shown being comically picky about his breakfast (specifically, the perfectibility of his eggs). He claims to see “imperfection stick out like the nose on your face” and is so troubled by imbalance that when he steps into manure, he purposefully dirties his other foot as well to even it out. Thus, the movie introduces not only a new neurotic element to the famous detective, but instills a sense of humor into him as well.</p><p>When solving a particularly divisive theft (the suspects are a rabbi, a priest, and an imam) at the Wall of Jerusalem prior to his journey on the Orient Express, Poirot establishes a unique crime-solving style. In a long monologue, Poirot relies primarily on his understanding of human nature in order to pinpoint the culprit: he first identifies a plausible motive and uses it to anticipate the evidence, reversing the typical process. Furthermore, Poirot attests that, “There is right. There is wrong. There is no in between,” displaying great faith in his ability to differentiate between the two. It is an innovative effort on behalf of the creators of the film to introduce its protagonist as a genius with a great sense of justice, perhaps a more ethical and extremely French Sherlock Holmes. At the same time, such an effort sets the tone of the movie as the study of a human conscience mixed with comedic elements and modern day messages.</p><p>The film dedicates itself to presenting Poirot as a more human character than the enigma he was in Christie’s time. In the novel, Christie provides little insight into Poirot’s moral compass, primarily focusing on his determination to solve a tricky crime and the ingenuity with which he does this. The film, on the other hand, emphasizes how Poirot handles his idea of ethics, lamenting, “I see evil on this train.” This allows the movie to have a greater meaning than simply a murder mystery and gives Poirot a greater level of complexity (beyond that of a brilliant detective) than he had in the novel.</p><p>The film also establishes the reality of discrimination in 1930s Europe and supports this with greater diversity in casting. Leslie Odom Jr., of Hamilton fame, is an African American who plays the role of Doctor Arbuthnot; and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, who is Hispanic, plays the new role of Biniamino Marquez. Race is a theme in the film notably absent from the 1934 novel, and it reflects a modern influence. For instance, Dr. Arbuthnot relates the difficulty of becoming a doctor as a black man, and the reality that he might be blamed for the murder by the police, simply because of his race, is acknowledged by several characters. This new element allows the film to access more important themes and reflects the influence of persisting societal issues.</p><p>Wisely, Branagh seizes the advantages of the film medium by accentuating the movie’s visual elegance. The contrast between the bright, colorful, lively stations or cities and the more gray-scale, subdued aura of the train is a subtle yet powerful reinforcement of the train’s darker atmosphere. The experimentation with points of view, such as the bird’s eye view of the scene where the body of evil businessman Samuel Ratchett is first found, allows the film to emphasize the cramped and tense atmosphere of the train. Branagh’s use of shots through crystal window reflections create a funhouse mirror effect that emphasizes the lack of transparency aboard the train, drawing audiences in a way that the novel cannot.</p><p>Conversely, the screenwriting of the film instills a humorous and witty tone that perfectly mirrors Agatha Christie’s. Christie’s ironic tone throughout the novel is a significant part of its appeal, and while the film does a good job in capturing Poirot’s dry humor, it is Bouc, a reinvisioned character played by Tom Bateman, who provides much of the film’s comedy. A shameless hedonist (in his first scene, he is seeking a remote place in which to have a twenty minute “argument” with a prostitute), he serves as the perfect foil to Poirot’s astute character—a young man not yet disillusioned with the world. He seems an even better companion to Poirot than Christie wrote in the novel, accentuating Poirot’s professionalism while also bringing out his humorous side as Poirot frustrates Buoc with comments about the mystery such as, “If it were easy, I would not be famous.”</p><p>Considering the fame of the novel, much of the film’s success seemed as though it would inevitably rest on performance, rather than plot. This might explain why the movie’s cast consists almost entirely of heavy-hitting actors: Dame Judy Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Derek Jacobi are just a few of the huge names associated with the film. However, it is a somewhat disappointing ensemble cast, if only because in its excessive focus on Poirot, the film gives the other actors little time to fully distinguish their talent.</p><p>Despite their confines, the cast is still able to put on an impressive performance. The drama in the movie was greatly elevated, specifically in Poirot’s confrontation with Dr. Arbuthnot, where the latter confesses to the crime and shoots Poirot to protect his lover, Mary Debenham (played by Daisy Ridley) from suspicion. This scene, too, is original, and sharply differs from the more subdued and slow-burning nature of Christie’s novel. The film’s climax, Poirot’s confrontation with the suspects, in the conclusive test to their characters, has a far greater emotional appeal to the audience than the book. By stressing Poirot’s insistence that the world is black and white, the film makes his reaction to a totally in-the-gray situation compelling in a way that the novel is not quite able to.</p><p>While the film is unlikely to receive the same cult following as its novel predecessor, it is a refreshing take on Agatha Christie’s beloved novel. It is simultaneously able to give the story a new level of complexity as well as retain the suspense and charm of an old-fashioned murder mystery, and perhaps by those merits alone can be considered a success.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:33:37.503793	13	6	How does Kenneth Branagh’s new film adaptation of “Murder on the Orient Express” compare to Agatha Christie’s legendary novel?
61	﻿Being Attracted To Kids Is Not A Choice, It’s A Monstrosity	being-attracted-to-kids-is-not-a-choice-it-s-a-monstrosity	<spec-reference id=36></spec-reference><p>Recent years have seen an increase in calls to reduce the stigma of pedophilia, borne from parallel movements of destigmatizing mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety. However, not all disorders were created alike—unlike most common mental illnesses, pedophilia is inherently predatory and a danger to our society. Though pedophilia is a paraphilic disorder, phrasing it simply as a “sexual preference” is a colossal injustice to the millions of lives destroyed by pedophiles. A sexual preference is “I prefer bigger women,” or “I like men with beards”; pedophilia is the most severe atrocity known to man.</p><p>Pedophile sympathizers argue that encouraging pedophiles to openly take part in society helps them avoid criminal behavior. This is an unnerving mentality, for the simple reason that pedophiles pose a greater threat in their potential proximity of children than when pushed to the fringes of society where they belong. The reputation of pedophiles as skilled manipulators of children is not an undeserved one. According to a 2003 National Institute of Justice report, three out of every four adolescent sexual assault victims knew their attackers well. This throws a wrench in the attempt to portray pedophiles as victims petrified by desires that take over and cause them to pounce on nearby children in the heat of their impulses.</p><p>In reality, pedophiles gain access to their victims by integrating themselves into the lives of children close to them (through schools, churches, family friends, youth sports teams, etc.), and then by winning the trust of the child, who instinctively turns to the adult for support and attention. The adult then initiates the gradual process of sexualizing this relationship and desensitizing their victims to inappropriate behavior. Once successful, they continue to escalate their harassment until their victim is fully under their control, emotionally isolated, and not likely to speak out against them. This system is carefully controlled, purposeful, and requires caution and patience from pedophilic predators—nothing about it is impetuous or “compulsory.” The fact that they blend in well with ordinary society, that they could be your next-door neighbor or local Little League coach, makes them more dangerous, not more sympathetic.</p><p>The juxtaposition of gay people and pedophiles stems from the same foul logic as pedophile apologism itself. Yes, parallels can be drawn between the way gay people and pedophiles were and are viewed; parallels can also be drawn between the way pedophiles and kinksters are viewed, or the way pedophiles and prostitutes are viewed. However, none of these parallels are relevant or add credibility to the case for pedophile sympathy because they aren’t comparable to the inherent predatory nature of pedophilia. Correlation never implies causation: just because homosexuality and pedophilia were once reviled does not mean it was deservedly so for both, and just because society has become more tolerant toward the LGBT community doesn’t mean pedophiles deserve the same. Furthermore, considering the history gay men have had with being accused of being perverts and lumped in with pedophiles by virtue of their sexuality, another attempt to create a catch-all category with “sexual deviance” as the criteria—the only trait desperately straining to connect pedophilia and homosexuality—falls spectacularly flat.</p><p>Not only is victimizing pedophiles misguided, it’s also actively harmful. Painting pedophiles as suffering victims imparts the wrong message upon impressionable children, especially when reporting rates are already at such an astonishing low. Even with pedophilia as widely stigmatized as it is today, only an estimated one in 20 cases of child sexual abuse, or CSA, are reported. Within that narrow margin, even with definite proof of penetration, only five to 15 percent of child victims will have genital injuries consistent with recognized sexual abuse. This isn’t even accounting for the fact that CSA isn’t solely limited to physical contact; it includes exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography, which are much harder to expose and successfully prosecute without the testimony of the victim or video footage of the crime. Even in cases when the victim was not manipulated into staying silent, the odds are stacked against them. These facts form a grim image: in a world where pedophilia is chased in the shadows, shining a sympathetic spotlight on pedophiles drives their victims further into the dark.</p><p>If pedophilia can indeed be curbed to an extent, our society’s heavy moral stigma is what is keeping those “hidden” pedophiles terrified to offend. Plenty of pedophiles already create justifications out of thin air for their desires and actions, such as claiming they were seduced by their victims or arguing that they were providing their victims with a higher level of spiritual education. Without the stigma attached to pedophilia, these pre-existing trends of rationalization will skyrocket—after all, destigmatizing pedophilia validates pedophiles’ acts of self-victimization.</p><p>There are many who believe that pedophiles can be rehabilitated, and that the risk of allowing pedophiles to roam freely is well worth the reward of treatment that has supposedly proven to be successful. It’s important to remember that there is no way to measure the efficacy of a treatment of this kind with complete accuracy because of the high rate of unreported cases, and because in this situation, it’s impossible to ethically conduct an experiment to test if a treatment is working, as is done with other forms of treatment.</p><p>That said, there are still a variety of methods used to attempt to treat pedophilia. One such method is the use of hormone treatments, such as Androgen Deprivation Therapy and progestogens as libido inhibitors—in other words, chemical castration. Though it was partially effective in reducing the libidos of participants, sexual desire cannot be completely eliminated by chemical castration, which led to rising doubts about the efficacy of the treatment and the potential risk of releasing sex offenders who still experienced sexual desire for children. The treatment is also unreliable by its very nature because the patient must be depended on to regularly take his medication. Additionally, sex drive is not the only factor involved in CSA; in fact, it’s not even the primary factor. Stemming from their emotional and mental attraction to children, some pedophiles often believe that they have a uniquely close relationship with their victims, and that they love and care for them in a special way. This denial runs deep; there are pedophiles who even believe their victims asked for their “bond.” For other pedophiles, sexual contact with children is a way for them to feel powerful and in control of their own lives while simultaneously fulfilling their needs. Neither of these issues can be touched by libido inhibitors.</p><p>Another common treatment utilized for pedophilia is therapy. There are only a few therapeutical studies on patients with pedophilia, but the results those yielded are mostly negative or inconclusive. A group of researchers, published in the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, found that sex offenders who completed therapy weren’t any more likely to be empathetic toward their past victims than sex offenders who hadn’t completed therapy. One randomized controlled trial meant to evaluate the efficacy of a relapse prevention program showed that after eight years, sex offenders who underwent the therapeutical program and control groups who did not both experienced the same rates of recidivism.</p><p>Some protest that the U.S.’s mandatory reporting laws, which require that professionals who work with children be trained to spot signs of child abuse and report it, keep pedophiles from seeking treatment that would ultimately better them, but the evidence above illustrates the futility of such efforts. In fact, mandatory reporting laws need to be enforced, not relaxed. The dismissal of Syracuse assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine and the arrest of Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky—both for sexually abusing young boys—demonstrates the need to seal loopholes in our child protection system. Though both men and their staff worked with college students officially, they regularly worked with kids of all ages in summer camps. Since the staff were officially employed at a university, they were not trained as mandated reporters. As a result, these tragedies quietly slipped through the cracks.</p><p>The case for minimizing pedophilia in our society seems bleak, but if we look past our myopic emphasis on victimizing the child predators responsible, heartening news lies ahead of us. According to the records of law enforcement agencies, sexual crimes against U.S. children declined 53 percent between 1992 and 2006. The most likely causes were increased amounts of police and CPS workers and stronger efforts to prosecute child sex offenders. This demonstrates that what we need to crack down on child molestation isn’t misplaced sympathy, but the enforcement of our current protective laws and a firm emphasis on pedophiles’ status as monsters, not sufferers. Public education programs (such as stopitnow.org) educating bystanders on how to act on their suspicions of CSA have also proven useful. Instead of investing any kind of energy into caring about pedophiles, we need to band together and return to prioritizing child safety over pedophile feelings.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 05:31:52.416616	2	1	
187	﻿The Pinnacle of Time Management	the-pinnacle-of-time-management	<p>With the APs quickly approaching, many Stuyvesant students have their noses buried in test-prep books as if they were searching for a second-term senior’s commitment to school. Others completely replace studying with the time-honored tactic of not studying. Sophomore Andrew Werner, on the other hand, has brought his third-best idea—after his wildly successful Flag Rugby team and Satanic Ritual club—to fruition: a time machine. “This machine will revolutionize the way students study for history tests. We can watch history like we watch Netflix,” Werner said.</p><p>AP World History teacher Zachary Berman gave his thoughts on Werner’s creation: “While it’s a marvel of science, a time machine simply isn’t practical. History is long, and events like the Attack of the Clones require context and 30 shekels to fully understand. A better application of the time machine may be to actively change history so you can’t possibly get anything wrong on the AP test!” Berman proceeded to wear off his caffeine high by spinning around like a Sufi.</p><p>While altering the past seems tempting, telling yourself from the beginning of the semester to prepare a textbook-sized outline to cram the night before the test seems more practical. Anyway, the odds of riding along with Werner are slim since the whole sophomore class is clamoring for a seat like it’s an open computer at the printing station, so good luck!</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:39:30.543955	5	1	A student builds a time machine to study for the AP World test.
3	National Genes in Space Competition Won by Sophomore Elizabeth Reizis	national-genes-in-space-competition-won-by-sophomore-elizabeth-reizis	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Sophomore Elizabeth Reizis’ experiment on the effects of microgravity on immune system cell differentiation tied for first place in the National Genes in Space competition, which concluded on June 20. Reizis shared the first place position with Sophia Chen from Lakeside, Washington, and both experiments will be performed on board the International Space Station (ISS) in June 2018.</p><p>Reizis’ victory marks the second year in a row a Stuyvesant student has won the competition. Senior Julian Rubinfien won first place in the 2016 Genes in Space competition, focusing on the adverse effects a change in telomere lengths have on aging.</p><p>Genes in Space, a competition for students in grades seven to 12, asks students to come up with an experimental proposal in which they attempt to address a challenge in space travel. In their proposals, students are required to show proper usage and understanding of polymerase chain reactions. They are then expected to use the ISS as the test site for the proposal.</p><p>Reizis’ proposal went through a rigorous selection process beginning in April of this year and ending in May with the announcement of 25 awardees. Among these was Stuyvesant senior Kai Hin Lui, who received an honorable mention. Reizis was then named one of five finalists and met with a Ph.D. mentor from Harvard to refine her proposal.</p><p>Finalists presented their ideas at the ISS Research and Development Conference in Washington, D.C., during mid-July. “As a usually shy person, the thought of presenting in front of a large audience and a panel of judges seemed absolutely terrifying. When I walked into the presentation room, I could feel my laser pointer shaking in my hands. But, when I started talking about the idea that I had worked on for so long, I realized that there was no need to overthink,” she said.</p><p>Reizis’ proposal addresses immunodeficiencies astronauts face during and after space travel. She designed her experiment to focus on the effect microgravity has on T-cell development. T-cells are a type of white blood cell that help defend the body from pathogens. They are able to recognize cancerous, infected, and foreign cells by use of protein receptors on their cell membranes.</p><p>To make a variety of T-cell receptors, different segments of DNA are cut out and switched around. The resulting DNA is a T-cell Receptor Excision Circle (TREC), circular strands of DNA formed from cut-out parts of a long strand of DNA of a developing T-cell.</p><p>“My objective is to study the rate of T-cell development by measuring the number of [TRECs] in the astronauts’ blood,” Reizis said.</p><p>The maturation of a T-cell will usually result in the production of only one TREC. By measuring the amount of TRECs in the blood, Reizis plans to find the rate of T-cell development in space.</p><p>Reizis and Rubinfien’s success in the competition has opened doors for them in the field. “I have had the chance to network and discuss future plans with many scientists all over, many of whom were very willing to assist me in finding internships and labs in their own or other fields,” Reizis said. “I’m incredibly grateful for all the possibilities that this competition has brought me.”</p><p>Both Reizis and Rubinfien credit honors biology teacher Jessica Quenzer for pushing them to apply for the competition and for helping them edit and refine their proposals. “After reading about the past winners and researching the current issues surrounding spaceflight, I was eager to write up my own draft of ideas,” Reizis said. “Ms. Quenzer encouraged our whole class to apply, and I decided that it was not an opportunity I wanted to miss and quickly sent in my research proposal.”</p><p>Quenzer hopes to continue this winning streak by continuing to encourage students to enter the Genes in Space competition. She plans to make the Genes in Space proposal a mandatory assignment.</p>	108	1	f	2017-09-11 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 07:48:51.418394	1	1	Sophomore Elizabeth Reizis won the National Genes in Space competition for her experiment on the effects of microgravity on immune system cell differentiation, marking Stuyvesant’s second win in a row.
56	“The College Essay Guidebook”: A Look into Dr. Mandler’s Latest Book	the-college-essay-guidebook-a-look-into-dr-mandler-s-latest-book	<p>English teacher Dr. David Mandler’s latest book, “The College Essay Guidebook,” was released on September 25. The book includes 30 activities that help  guide the reader to writing effective responses to the Common Application questions. It also includes a grammar section and essay draft progressions from former Stuyvesant seniors.</p><p>Dr. Mandler has published another book, a nonfiction work titled “Arminius Vambéry and the British Empire: Between East and West,” as well as a short story, and numerous articles in the Budapest Times.</p><p>He wrote his latest book to help his students, as well as others across the country, produce an effective story about themselves. “I had to do something to guide people. It’s really in the spirit of alleviating much of the stress that students feel in creating an essay that I wanted to do this book,” Dr. Mandler said.</p><p>The new book also includes student reflections from seniors who have gone through the college process. “I find that this book is very relevant, especially to Stuyvesant students, because the advice in the book comes straight from last year’s seniors,” Dr. Mandler said. “They allowed me to integrate some of their essays, using their names and college affiliations. But the book is open enough to allow for any other high school senior to understand.”</p><p>He also chose to create a publishing press for this book, the “Ergo Sum Press.” The name is derived from Descartes’s “I think, therefore I am.” “The major negative [of] looking for a publisher is the time period,” Dr. Mandler said. “[It takes] at least a year or two for a book to run the course of selection. I wanted to retain control over what the book looked like. When you go with a publisher, you give up a lot of control of what goes into the book.”</p><p>Dr. Mandler is also in the process of writing two more texts: a novel and a book of poetry.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 20:15:37.889944	1	1	Dr. Mandler has published his newest book, a manual dedicated to helping high school students write their college essays.

70	﻿Rowell’s Best: Favorites from a Fan	rowell-s-best-favorites-from-a-fan	<p>Though a fairly recent name in literature, Rainbow Rowell has quickly secured her place as the voice of a generation. Originally a columnist and ad copywriter at the Omaha World-Herald, Rowell began writing as a pastime. Best known for her work in the young adult scene, Rowell is a versatile writer that tackles the messiness of life and people as they fall in and out of love. In her books, Rowell plays with time and structure to craft authentic characters. The simplicity and raw emotion of Rowell’s writing creates a profoundness and depth that feels genuine, rather than forced, like a more delicate John Green. Through pop culture references and a modern writing style, Rowell is able to connect to young and old.</p><p>Fangirl</p><p>“Fangirl” centers around Cath Avery, a Simon Snow fangirl and famous fanfiction writer, who heads off to college with her twin sister, Wren. Once inseparable, Wren decides she wants be independent in college, leaving Cath alone to find her way and figure out who she is. The journey is long and uncomfortable. Cath, for example, stays in her dorm room eating protein bars to avoid the possible awkwardness of the cafeteria and has dance parties in her room. Because of this, Cath is utterly lovable in her relatability, and ends up triumphant because despite pressures to party and stop writing fanfictions, Cath embraces and holds on to who she is. A cast of quirky characters accompanies Cath: her confident, vulgar, but kind roommate Reagan, Reagan’s charming friend Levi, Cath’s lonely and mentally unstable father, and fellow English major Nick.</p><p>“Fangirl” is interlayered with excerpts of Cath’s own fanfiction, the magical, Harry Potter-like world of Simon Snow mirroring Cath’s complicated life. The excerpts, though entertaining stories on their own, subconsciously reveal Cath’s frustrations and the lessons she learns. “Fangirl” shines in revealing a unique perspective on college life and is optimistic with the message that people will love you for who you are.</p><p>Landline</p><p>“Landline” is the story of an independent woman, Georgie McCool, who tries to have it all: a career and a family. Georgie, a successful comedy writer, gets a chance to write the show she’s always dreamed of writing, requiring her to skip out on the Christmas family holiday. This creates tension in her already strenuous relationship with her husband, Neal. When calling Neal from her old childhood room, Georgie reaches Neal from 10 years ago, early in their relationship. Through the phone calls, Rowell pieces together an intricate story of Georgie’s past, leaving the future in question as Georgie struggles to decide if Neal would be better off without her.</p><p>The paranormal aspect of “Landline” allows Georgie to follow through on the eternal human desire of going back in time, using what we know now to fix our past mistakes. The question raised through Georgie’s inner conflict, if love is enough in a relationship, forces readers to reevaluate the choices that they have made in their lives. “Landline” also does well with making a mature love story ridiculously cute. Georgie’s descriptions of Neal and his romantic gestures are sweet and moving: “Neal didn't take Georgie's breath away. Maybe the opposite. But that was okay—that was really good, actually, to be near someone who filled your lungs with air.” Exploring an older perspective than other Rowell books, “Landline” excels in making deep feelings warm and fuzzy and portraying the complicated but honest visual of a modern woman in an imperfect but real love story.</p><p>Eleanor and Park</p><p>Arguably Rowell’s most famous work, “Eleanor and Park” offers hope as two disconnected outcasts find each other, and themselves in the process. Eleanor is the new, immediately unpopular girl in town; bullied and from an abusive household, she buries herself in music and books. Park, quiet and with an overbearing father, mostly keeps to himself. Told from dual perspectives, “Eleanor and Park” slowly reveals how the two fall in love in a heartwarming story.</p><p>The character of Park strays from the typical, hyper-masculine love interest so often presented in young adult fiction. Instead, Park is a flawed but kind and brave person who enjoys comics and occasionally wears eyeliner. Park’s immigrant mother struck a chord with me because it’s so rare to see first-generation Americans shown in popular books. Throughout the book, Park struggles with his half-Korean identity. He learns to find solace in his mother, Mindy, who, because of her own status as an outsider, is able to understand what Park and Eleanor are going through.</p><p>“Eleanor and Park” is a passionate, memorable story because of how deeply emotional it is and how it encapsulates the teenage experience. For Eleanor and Park, life is messy and hard, the way being a teenager is. However, despite hardships, Eleanor and Park have such a strong and heartfelt bond, solidified through mixtapes and ‘80s lyrics, that in both the giddy and the heart-wrenching moments, a sense of hope underlies the book. It is the hope that you are worthy just because of who you are and that life, no matter how bad it seems, always gets better.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:03:14.65135	15	1	Some of Rainbow Rowell’s best works

71	﻿To Eat Ramen in Peace	to-eat-ramen-in-peace	<p>Juxtaposed alongside nondescript warehouses and newly built luxury condos sits Ichiran Ramen, a haven for ramen-loving introverts. The renowned Japanese chain debuted its first U.S. location in Brooklyn’s Bushwick merely a year ago, but the bustling restaurant has garnered a popularity so large that it has begun to dominate ramen culture.</p><p>To step into Ichiran is to step into another world, with Japanese music in the background, a plethora of posters with Japanese writing on the wall, and a string of red lanterns dangling from the ceiling. Though Ichiran is a chain that has been around in Japan since the 1960s, there is a tangible vibrancy and uniqueness within its walls that does not appear manufactured.</p><p>The restaurant is split into two distinct compartments, one being standard table seating. The second compartment is what essentially drew Ichiran to its current state of fame and is where most request to dine; it’s a procession of “concentration” booths that allow people to eat in isolation, with minimal to no contact with the restaurant waiters.</p><p>I am seated at a concentration booth on a stool with wooden dividers on either side of me. In front of me, thin bamboo shades cover a wide slit in the wall. Hands of anonymous waiters then lift the shade to slide an ordering form towards me, enabling me to customize my own bowl of ramen, detailing the amount of seasoning and the firmness of the noodles.</p><p>After I’ve filled it out, the same hands reappear from behind the shades to collect the forms. It is roughly a 20-minute wait for the food to come. In that time, I am free to read the signs and posters above my head, which detail the concept of these concentration booths: their purpose, they state, is to provide all customers with the personal freedom of having an intimate experience with their ramen and minimal distraction.</p><p>After 20 minutes, the bamboo shades are lifted, and the noodles arrive in an oriental bowl with a soup spoon and chopsticks. On a culinary level, it is simple yet visually stunning. Scallions are presented on the left side of the bowl, a dollop of red spicy seasoning is placed on top of the bed of noodles in the center, and char-siu slices are placed on the right, all of which float in a steaming pork-based broth.</p><p>The ramen is rich and savory, teeming with umami flavor. Instructions on the plaque above my head tell me that in order to experience their ramen “the Ichiran way,” I should “carefully slurp three or four spoonfuls from the side of the bowl [and] then gradually incorporate the other toppings.” The scallions, char-siu, and Hidan no Tare (red spicy sauce) provide layers of brilliant flavor, adding to the underlying intense flavor from the broth.</p><p>Among many, one innovative facet of Ichiran is the kae-dama system, or noodle refill. Should I desire a refill of noodles, I can easily press a call button that prompts the waiter to bring the kae-dama.</p><p>Ichiran sells only a few other things in addition to their Tonkotsu ramen: their matcha drink, various Japanese beers, and matcha-almond pudding. The ramen comes at a minimum price of $18.90, and though it may be pricier than the average Stuy student’s budget for ramen, it is ultimately worth the price, as their dining experience rivals that of any other ramen restaurant.</p><p>Ichiran reassures us that it is neither unusual nor disconcerting to have the desire to eat alone in a public setting. We are given a moment to ourselves and a room to be fully present with the food in front of us. For the people who may be hesitant to try Ichiran with the fear of eating alone in public, they can provide more than a good bowl of ramen—perhaps an opportunity to momentarily reconcile with ourselves in our fast-paced lives as Stuyvesant students. Innovative in its ability to allow us to truly pause and appreciate food, Ichiran invents itself as an emblem of culinary mindfulness.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 23:41:18.702936	14	1

316	﻿Runnin’ Rebels Open Season With Nail-Biter	runnin-rebels-open-season-with-nail-biter	<p>Every fan in the bleachers, every coach and player on the bench and on the court swiveled their heads in unison as the ball arched toward the basket; no one had as much anticipation, however, as senior Nicholas Kim, whose arm was still suspended in the air as his wrist flicked. The entire gym followed the ball as it bounced off the back of the rim and onto the court below. Just missing that final shot, the Runnin’ Rebels, Stuyvesant’s boys’ basketball team, were defeated in a nail-biter in their season opener against the Hunter College High School Eagles. The final score was 42-41.</p><p>It was a back-and-forth game, with the Rebels surging to an early lead but getting blown out in the second quarter 18-7. Despite winning the last two quarters and going on a late run, the team fell just short of a comeback. The Rebels struggled with unforced turnovers throughout the game, according to both senior Nicola Manfredi and Kim. “There wasn’t a lot of flow in the game,” Manfredi said. “There was a lot of subbing, so no one could really get into the gist of the game.” Despite three relatively stagnant quarters to start the contest, the Rebels seemed to finally gain some momentum late in the fourth quarter. The run was sparked by a three-pointer from Kim, followed by several stops on the defensive side of the ball. In wake of the heartbreaking loss, the Rebels have managed to extract some positives. “We moved the ball around well; we took good shots. I thought our defense was very good as well. We only held them to 42 points,” Manfredi said.</p><p>In addition to this league opener against the Eagles, the Rebels have played three non-league games, winning one of the three. They faced Leon M. Goldstein High School for Science and Jacqueline K. Onassis Intel Careers in a Thanksgiving tournament at Millennium High School, falling 46-64 and prevailing 59-55, respectively. Finally, they were ousted by Martin L. King Jr. 23-48 soon before the regular season opener. Junior Richard Zheng emerged as a scoring threat in these games, which meant good news for the future of Stuyvesant basketball.</p><p>In league play, the Rebels have struggled thus far. They currently sit at the bottom of their division with an 0-3 record. After the home opener, they dropped two straight against the Eleanor Roosevelt High School Huskies and the East Harlem Pride. The scores were 47-57 and 52-64, respectively. However, the team showed signs of progress in the East Harlem game as senior Michael Gillow joined Kim and Manfredi in double-digit point scoring.</p><p>The Rebels have set their goals high; as both Kim and Manfredi said, their ultimate goal is “to make playoffs.” However, they have kept themselves grounded. “For now, we just want to win one game at a time,” Kim said. Their most conspicuous issues thus far have been turnovers and a lack of flow. Nonetheless, the team is optimistic and attributes much of its struggles to getting used to a new system with first-year coach, guidance counselor Paul Goldsman, and the new players on the team getting used to playing at the fast-paced varsity level. “With a new coach, the returners had to adapt to a new play-style, and the rookies have to experience playing basketball on the varsity level. Moving forward, I know that we'll start to grow together and learn how to play with one another,” Kim said.</p><p>Clearly, the entire team is on the same page. “Since half the varsity team is new, my goal is to get the players acclimated with each other. I often switch lineups (both in games and in practice) to help ensure that different players learn multiple positions, as well as how to play the game with different people,” Goldsman said. While citing the same weaknesses as his players, Goldsman also gave his coach’s insight into the things this year’s squad has going for it. He said, “Players are always willing to make the extra pass and find the open man. Nobody dominates the ball and everyone is always involved in our offense. I think this can be attributed to our players wanting to make each other better, while also ensuring that everyone feels like a member of the team.” Also, “the players, especially our seniors, have been guiding the other players and giving them instruction and encouragement. They provide guidance on running certain plays and make keen observations during the game,” Goldsman said.</p><p>As they continue to adjust and work out the kinks in their new system, the Rebels anticipate the season, which will be going into full throttle shortly, with optimism. “I know that our coach knows what he's doing and our players have a passion to win, so hopefully, the pieces will start falling into place,” Kim said. Led by Kim and Manfredi, the team will look to build off the positives against Hunter to remain competitive in the Manhattan A1 division. “I know that as we continue to learn the plays and build up confidence, we will score more points, which will result in some victories,” Goldsman said.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:02:26.752663	24	1	
324	﻿Phoenix Look to Carry On Tradition of Success	phoenix-look-to-carry-on-tradition-of-success	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>“We want to win, but our vision isn’t solely fixed on that one goal. We want to win the right way,” senior and co-captain Shannon Lau said. This statement indicates more than just a competitive desire; it suggests an extremely healthy team culture that carries over from success on the court to class off of it.</p><p>A strong team culture stems from a sound veteran nucleus, and the Phoenix have just that with three seniors entering their fourth season: Lau, forward and co-captain Delaney Demark, and guard Joan Ngai. The Phoenix have maintained a bountiful three-year run with these three on the team, averaging 13 wins a season and finishing first in the Manhattan A South League two of three times. In theory, with Lau and Demark serving as the team’s captains and Ngai due to have substantial minutes off the bench, this streak should not cease.</p><p>In practice, though, there are legitimate roadblocks to overcome, such as the fact that numerous contributors from last season are no longer with the team. The biggest loss is Tiffany Ng (‘17). Beyond offering solid defense at guard, Ng was also the team’s best three-point shooter by a wide margin, hitting 23 of the Phoenix’s 34 total three-point shots over the course of last season and playoffs. And, according to Lau, Ng also contributed significantly to the team’s spirit, chemistry, and dynamic. With professional basketball teams like the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets finding sustained success built around three-point shooting, such a strategy was bound to trickle down to the high school level sooner than later, so the departure of last year’s top performer in that department will have consequences.</p><p>According to Demark, though, the Phoenix have a contingency plan, stating that junior Kaitlyn Duong and Lau have both “demonstrated that they are more than capable of hitting threes,” she says. Being a captain that has spent multiple seasons around both Duong and Lau, Demark speaks from experience. However, this assertion has little statistical backing, as Lau and Duong had just two three-pointers combined last year, so they would have to make a quantum leap to completely fill the void.</p><p>Another major piece from last season who is no longer with the team is senior Tara Greene, who transferred earlier this fall. Though she was not a prolific scorer, averaging just over 3.2 points a game, she was a ferocious rebounder, finishing with 69 rebounds over the course of the regular season, putting her third on the team and second among the Phoenix’s forwards. However, there seems to be a young successor ready to step up. Ana-Maria Skaricic, the team’s backup center, is only a freshman, but she may already have the attitude and tenacity to play from the get-go. “Aggression is a really hard concept to teach, but Ana-Maria nails it on offense and defense and is getting better each day,” Lau said. If Skaricic is able to improve in the coming years, it could make for a fearsome frontcourt between her and junior and starting center Ally Archer, who will split time with Skaricic in the low post.</p><p>Looking beyond the lost contributors, however, there are also a number of facets in which the Phoenix have improved. Last season, for instance, the team was moribund at the free throw line, with just one player (Demark) shooting over 65 percent from the stripe. This was a legitimate issue, and may have actually been the factor that kept Stuyvesant out of first place last year. The Phoenix’s “missed about five free throws each game,” Lau said, so considering that three of the team’s five losses, including the 33-29 loss to eventual division champion Millennium High School, came at margins under five points, the Phoenix truly were a few missed free throws away from a 15-2 first place finish.</p><p>This year, however, free throw shooting seems to be a point of emphasis. “Each practice, we’re running sprints and taking 20-30 free throws in between to make us game-ready,” Lau said. With head coach Vincent Miller apparently altering practices to address such a glaring problem from last season, the Phoenix should fare much better, both from the line and in close games.</p><p>Another bright spot is the team’s immense depth, provided by its young talent. Freshman and small forward Isabel Leka, for instance, is another candidate to help fill the so-called “three-and-D” role left by Tiffany Ng. “Isabel has been phenomenally cutting to the basket, playing defense, and shooting outside the arc,” said Lau, indicating that Leka should have a primary bench role for the Phoenix, in the very least. Two other names to watch are sophomores Eve Wening and Selene Kaehny, as they have provided valuable minutes for the team so far at the guard and forward positions, respectively.</p><p>“Coach Miller may use more of a rotation that includes more underclassmen than in previous years,” Demark said. If this is the case, this could lead to both a more diverse playbook and greater rest time for starters.</p><p>In fact, according to Lau, this is already happening: “Miller and I have incorporated a few more offensive and defensive sets. I believe that variety is important, especially when we get deeper into the season and play against teams for the second time,” she says. This is smart, as it indicates that the team is already looking to the playoffs. While the lost star power provided by players like Ng and Greene will hurt and could once again keep the Phoenix out of first place, all of that is pedestrian compared to the postseason.</p><p>So, if this revamped game plan truly does pay off, and if the Phoenix get a spark from the potential return of junior forward Talia Kirshenbaum, last year’s leading rebounder, from a semester at the Mountain School, Stuyvesant could prosper in January when it matters most. While the Phoenix are unlikely to usurp Millennium High School’s throne, a run into and beyond the third round of the playoffs—something that the team has been unable to accomplish during each of the last three seasons—is very much within the realm of possibility.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 19:38:22.522962	24	1	Under the leadership of seniors Shannon Lau and Delaney Demark, and behind a growing youth movement, the Phoenix look to go deep into the playoffs.

On one particular day, however, a flyer was seen making its way across the entire span of the bridge. In fact, this freshman entered the school with a whopping two flyers. Sarah Wong, the perpetrator, commented, “I really liked the agenda that they proposed. I picked up two to give one to my friend to see.”</p><p>What Sarah did not realize was that she had picked up flyers from two different campaigns. Both listed “working with the administration on science frees,” “the ability to enter school at 7:00 a.m.,” “more freshman electives and AP classes,” and “freshman class spirit.” The differences between their agendas were as minute as second-term seniors’ homework.</p><p>The amount of effort poured into campaign advertising this year reached record heights. The Schneider-Corr campaign team was seen hang gliding with their banner off of the seven to nine escalator. Four freshmen reported to the nurse’s office with nervous tics described as “a forceful jerk of the arm as if they were offering something to someone.”</p><p>In their victory, the Schneider-Corr campaign promises to completely revolutionize the role of the Freshman Caucus.

63	﻿A Terrorist Attack Happened in Vegas	a-terrorist-attack-happened-in-vegas	<p>“The act of terror then is the quantifiable use of human lives with the purpose of establishing fear.”</p><p>For an impossibly long ten minutes, bullets rained down over the heads of the 22,000 people attending the packed Route 91 country music festival in Las Vegas. Bewildered concert-goers initially thought that the bullets were pyrotechnics. From the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort, Stephen Paddock used dozens of modified firearms to shoot down on masses of innocent concert-goers, killing at least 58 and injuring over 500. By the end, it was the worst mass shooting in modern American history.</p><p>It is clear that this was a premeditated terrorist attack. Paddock deviously booked multiple hotel rooms throughout the Las Vegas area next to other high-attendance concerts. US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent Jill Snyder revealed that Paddock had purchased 33 assault weapons in the past year alone, and Clark County sheriff Joseph Lombardo indicated that Paddock had an escape plan as well. Cameras were arranged throughout his hotel room, and a getaway car replete with explosives and additional ammunition was set up. Furthermore, tens of thousands of dollars in overseas transactions and gambling all within weeks of the attack raised suspicious red flags.</p><p>Paddock senselessly attacked innocent civilians, meeting the textual meaning of terrorism. The overwhelming fear and panic was captured by the videos of concert-goers. Human lives became the means to an end.</p><p>In terrorism, the human lives lost become a quantifiable objective, a symbol for the progress toward violent and delusional motives. Paddock clearly demonstrated this; he did not attack particular individuals, but rather sought to kill scores of individuals—the greater the number, the better.</p><p>That being said, the official definition of terrorist attacks by the government is set by the US Department of State, which has a comprehensive list of Foreign Terror Organizations that consists of groups that have committed or have a clear intent for orchestrating a terrorist attack; key within its parameters, however, is “foreign.” A domestic terror charge does exist and it allows for the in-depth surveillance of groups associated with attacks, but it is not a criminal charge.</p><p>Because of the “foreign” label, domestic groups such as the Ku Klux Klan are conspicuously missing from the list of terrorist groups. Despite committing terrorizing atrocities throughout American history, these groups have maintained that they hold First Amendment rights and therefore cannot be classified by the government as a terror group subject to special scrutiny.</p><p>An example is Timothy McVeigh’s 1995 Oklahoma City bombing of a federal government building, which killed 168 and injured over 680. It had a clear and evidenced political motive in attempting to punish the US federal government. And yet, despite the terroristic characteristics of both the motive and the fulfillment, McVeigh’s attack was not charged under terrorism.</p><p>More recently, the Charlottesville incident that involved the ramming of a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one, was even explicitly called an act of “domestic terrorism” by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The assailant had made neo-Nazi political objectives as a high schooler, and the Unite the Right rally that he was a part of during the attack was spearheaded by various alt-right groups, including former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke. Yet, no charge of terrorism was brought up.</p><p>Classifying these domestic incidents as terrorist attacks holds important consequences. Terrorism creates vast avenues for federal authority and special attention, which have successfully quashed foreign terror threats through drone attacks and covert military take-outs. Even the domestic terrorism charge allows terrorist attacks to become linked to groups and movements and grants the government wide leverage to dissolve them.</p><p>Even “lone wolf” attacks often have accomplices and a deeper net of sympathizers; for example, McVeigh had learned how to weaponize explosive trucks through other anti-government conspiracists. Paddock’s getaway car and his ability to acquire and transport his arsenal of weapons suggests the presence of accomplices. And much like with foreign terrorist groups, government watch lists and surveillance highlight suspected domestic terrorists before they can do harm. Had Paddock been profiled, his build-up of firearms over the past year would have likely placed him on a watch list.</p><p>Though at this point it appears that Paddock did not have a politically-charged motive, it is important to note that terrorism in the modern world does not necessarily need to have a political dimension. An act of terror ought to refer to the act itself, much like how a murder is a murder and is prosecuted justly, regardless of whether it was a political assassination or a domestic violence case.</p><p>The act of terror, then, is the quantifiable use of human lives with the purpose of establishing fear. According to a 2016 CNN poll, over three-quarters of Americans fear a “lone-wolf” terrorism attack more than they do an attack from a foreign terrorist group. Labelling domestic “lone-wolf” attacks as terrorism is important to accurately reflect the fear associated. The great fear of terrorist attacks such as 9/11 has created symbols of terrorism in our mindsets, symbols that have driven us to the lengthiest war in American history; these symbolic connections need to be extrapolated to domestic terrorist attacks to have us adequately condemn them. Though thoughts and prayers are necessary for the victims and families of victims, action needs to be taken—labelling the attack as terrorism raises the stakes.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 20:54:35.54338	2	1	The Las Vegas attack meets a broadened scope of terrorism as it meets the textual definition of terrorism and used human lives as a means to an end; it is important to term it a terrorist attack for governmental intervention and societal condemnation.

However, the game got off to a rough start for the Pinheads. “We called a timeout after the sixth frame. There wasn’t much time left in the game and both our A and B teams were down by a lot of pins. At that point, it was time for us to stop worrying about the other team and just do the best we [could],” senior and co-captain Sonal Parab said.</p><p>Her attitude re-energized the team, but it was too little too late for a comeback. Despite demolishing their opponent in game C with a score of 502-378, games A and B both ended in defeats for the Pinheads, effectively ending their season.</p><p>“The thought of losing was already looming over our heads and the tension was palpable,” senior and co-captain Emily Lee said. “One of our flaws was probably underestimating our opponents.” During the first two games, each Telecomm player bowled in triple digits and never allowed the Pinheads to climb back into the game. Parab did her best to bring her team back by bowling a 142 in game A and 150 in game C, but the team as a whole was unable to keep pace with Telecomm, losing game A with a score of 586-458 and game B with a score of 435-406.</p><p>Despite the difficult loss, the Pinheads had a largely successful season. The team finished their regular season with a 12-0 record in the Manhattan II division and entered the playoffs as the seventh seed (out of 40). They also had many impressive individual accomplishments, with Parab, senior Valerie Ng, and Lee finishing second through fourth in average pins per game in their division, with 148.36, 139.71, and 131.07, respectively.</p><p>One of the main reasons for the team’s regular season success was its chemistry and ability to remain upbeat. “My players constantly communicate with each other in practices and games and listen to one another to improve their skills. They offer each other support,” Coach Manuel Simon said. “We will always have each other’s backs,” Lee said. Daily practices and months worth of events created close-knit bonds that continue to the end of the season.</p><p>Next year will be a trying one for the Pinheads, since the team is losing five key seniors, all of whom averaged more than 117 pins per game and collectively made up three-quarters of the game A quartet and game C’s entire team in the Telecomm match. Furthermore, their unquantifiable leadership will especially be missed. “I also have great and efficient captains in Sonal Parab, Emily Lee, and Valerie Ng, who have exemplified great leadership skills since the beginning of the season,” Simon said. Junior Sylvia Li will be one of the players expected to take a larger role on the team, already bowling with the game A team this year and dominating to the tune of 121.5 pins per game, despite some playoff struggles (86.67 pins per game).</p><p>Though the Pinheads’ season ended a game or two before they would have liked, they kept their heads up in the end. “After the game, it was clear that the team had fun. Even though we lost, there were smiles all around,” Parab said. “We’ve had a good season and I’m proud to say that we were able to end off on a happy note.”</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:00:45.093022	24	1	Stuyvesant’s girls’ bowling team was defeated by Telecomm in the third round of the playoffs, but was otherwise proud of their overall performance this season.

Fresh off of winning the Borough Championships, the Greyducks looked to replicate that success in the much tougher City Championships on November 11 at Van Cortlandt Park. Going into the competition, the team knew it was going to be a bigger challenge than the Borough Championships but was driven to make it to the State Federation meet for the second year in a row. There were 198 and 154 participants in the junior varsity race and varsity race, respectively, from schools all over New York City, and all of them were ready to compete.</p><p>The top four teams in the varsity race would automatically qualify for State’s. As the results were announced, there were shouts of joy: the Greyducks had finished third, behind Brooklyn Technical High School and Susan Wagner High School, securing their spot at the State competition.</p><p>In the junior varsity race, sophomore Ester Suleymanov finished in ninth place with a time of 24:06:45. She was followed by senior Connie Lei (24:49:41) in 27th, sophomore Ling Chen (24:59:99) in 32nd, and junior Bernice Chen (25:39:18) in 49th place. Coach Rachel Beck noted that many new personal bests for the girls on the team were recorded at the City Championships.</p><p>Throughout the season, junior Clara Mohri and freshman Julianne Yotov had been leading the varsity team. This time, it was no different. Mohri finished at seventh (20:19:93) while Yotov finished seconds behind at ninth (20:24:28). They were followed by sophomore Elizabeth Reizis at 35th (22:03:97), freshman Agatha Edwards at 55th (22:52:91), junior Tiffany Zhong at 72nd (23:24:16), freshman Jessica Kwok at 90th (23:49:67), and junior Vivian Cribb at 97th (24:07:50). “We have been training very hard this season, so it’s great that all our work is paying off,” Yotov said.</p><p>“Although we suffered some injuries throughout the season, we were able to persevere and place third overall in the city,” Zhong said.</p><p>As the cross country season comes to a close, Coach Beck looks back on the season with great pride. “The lady Greyducks have had a very successful season. Both Coach [Laurie] Burke and I are extremely proud of all the girls on the team who showed up each week to run with heart and grit,” Coach Beck said. “We saw so many PR’s [personal records] over the course of the season. Our top seven girls will round out the season by heading upstate this weekend for the second year in a row to compete in the state meet! Stay tuned.”</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:00:56.418692	24	1	Going into the competition, the team knew it was going to be a bigger challenge than the Borough Championships but was driven to make it back to the State Federation meet.

68	﻿What has “Indie” Become?	what-has-indie-become	<p>“I like him, but he tries to be indie when really he’s just findie.” As my friend said this, I looked at her in disbelief. I had never used the word indie to describe something other than music, much less “findie.” When I further questioned my friend, Nora Grabcheski, a sophomore at Montclair High School in New Jersey, she described the word as, “Findie: fake indie. You know, the kids that wear indie clothes and listen to indie music but they’re just doing it because everyone in their friend group does it. Findie.”</p><p>Before a person can create a “fake” version of a word, they must know what the original word means. So what does indie even mean? It is a shorthand word for “independent,” referring to independent artists or producers without a budget or big production crew. These productions were stereotyped as being things that not everyone understood, such as abstract films or songs with raspy vocals and a ukelele stringing together slow notes.</p><p>Since then, indie culture has become mainstream. Now that technology is incredibly easy for most people to get their hands on and apps like SoundCloud and iMovie have allowed everyone to produce media independently, the meaning has changed. People who produce music through Garageband and upload it to SoundCloud can still be considered indie musicians, but along with music, they’ve seemed to create an entirely new culture that not only ties in music and films but fashion style and even a way of life.</p><p>As I’ve seen from living in New York City, people who consider themselves indie generally dress and act a certain way. These are the same people who somehow know all the obscure new bands or go to Greenwich Village on a Friday night to watch a student film production. Though indie simply means “independent,” I have noticed a certain style attributed to being indie.</p><p>Grabcheski described an outfit she would think of as being indie: “You gotta have some of your worn, loose-fitting green jeans, and then if you’re a girl, you wear no bra with some basic gray shirt or crazy thrift store shirt. Then maybe some Tevas or even some grunge boots, and you gotta carry your mini [...] Jansport. And of course, you can’t forget accesories. I would picture some funky, big, dangly earrings and a nose piercing.”</p><p>As I thought about how she described this style, I realized I had been noticing these trends around New York City and in the hallways of Stuyvesant, especially in the past few months. I have also heard a lot more talk about newer, but less “pop,” musicians, with people spreading their personal musical style by posting on their Instagram stories whatever song they’re currently listening to or going to hip warehouses and hole-in-the-wall cafes to see indie bands.</p><p>Indie style can be unique but mainstream at the same time. Though people still see trends such as baggy jeans or a nose piercing and wear them, it seems teenagers are finding ways to put their own personal twists on their outfits. Maybe they add a shirt they found while sifting through a thrift store or earrings from a stand on West 4th Street. Indie has always meant independent, and teens today are staying true to that.</p><p>In a society where Instagram and other social media platforms dictate which trends are acceptable, indie style breaks away from this confinement. Though there is a vague template for the indie style, it isn’t as defined as styles such as goth or hippie.</p><p>Indie culture is spreading, and it’s only getting more popular. Apps like Spotify allow indie bands from all over the world to be heard by listeners from other countries. Even on Netflix, there is an “Independent” section, which contains many foreign films. Expect to see a lot more of the style this year, whether it be in class at Stuyvesant or on the subway ride home. This style doesn’t seem to be losing followers anytime soon.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:50:01.051142	28	1	“I like him, but he tries to be indie when really he’s just findie.” As my friend said this, I looked at her in disbelief....

75	Lavar and the Ball Family’s Rise to Fame	lavar-and-the-ball-family-s-rise-to-fame	<p>Over the past year, LaVar Ball has become a household name in American sports. Through his outlandish statements, he has become the most famous father in the sports world. This newfound fame has trickled down to his son Lonzo Ball, who has made headlines without playing a minute in the NBA yet, and his younger brothers LaMelo Ball and LiAngelo Ball, who are in high school and college respectively. The Ball family even has a reality show on Facebook called “Ball in the Family.” Without LaVar’s presence in the media, the Ball family brand would not have become this prominent.</p><p>To have a big brand, an athlete must excel in the sport but also have a charismatic personality. San Antonio Spurs small forward Kawhi Leonard may be widely regarded by fans as one of the elite players in the league; however, his quiet demeanor on and off the court hasn’t helped him grow his brand. Los Angeles Clippers power forward Blake Griffin, on the other hand, has many commercial deals because of his high-flying dunks and marketability, even if he isn’t as talented as Leonard on the court.</p><p>LaVar’s antics have proven to be successful in growing his company. He has said that he could beat Michael Jordan one-on-one. He has claimed that Lonzo is better than two-time league MVP, Stephen Curry. He came out with a $500 shoe for Lonzo, the ZO2, saying that the shoes are only meant for “big ballers.” Every time LaVar does something controversial, Big Baller Brand gets more attention. The NBA media loves controversy, such as with the Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook feud last season after Durant left Oklahoma City, and recently with the Kyrie-LeBron drama. LaVar is more than a troll; he is a shrewd businessman. When he goes on First Take on ESPN, he knows that he is getting free advertisement. The shouting matches between him and host Stephen A. Smith bring attention and press which lead to more people finding out about Big Baller Brand.</p><p>"A brand is one of the biggest things you can have," LaVar said in an interview with USA Today. "It's a hard thing to attain, so nobody wants to attain it and not too many people think that far ahead.” It seems like LaVar’s marketing has gone according to plan so far. The Lakers are going to be on national TV a lot this year, and season tickets have sold out already. Lonzo Ball may be the most hyped rookie since Lebron James in 2003.</p><p>Many argue that Lonzo should speak for himself, but he is usually blunt and nonchalant on and off the court, so LaVar is taking matters into his own hands. Without LaVar’s bold statements, Lonzo would be just be another promising young rookie. Lonzo was great in college, but his numbers of 14.6 points, 7.6 assists, and 6.0 rebounds per game alone would not have brought on anywhere near the amount of attention he has garnered. LaVar may be obnoxious, but it is hard to fault a man for trying to find success for his family.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:21:47.733535	6	1	Lavar’s antics are genius from a marketing standpoint.
76	Where Statistics Meet Football: The Fourth Down Dilemma	where-statistics-meet-football-the-fourth-down-dilemma	<p>New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick made what was, to many, a “bad” call on November 15, 2009. On the fourth down, with two yards to go from his own 28 yard line and 2:08 left on the clock, the Patriots were leading the Indianapolis Colts 34-28 and Belichick elected to go for it. The attempt failed and the Colts scored just three plays later to steal the win in dramatic fashion, with Belichick being blamed entirely for letting a game that was all but won slip away.</p><p>Historically, Belichick’s decision seems to be radical and out of place. However, with the emergence of new analytics and data science in the world of sports, we can reexamine this decision from a far more informed perspective, as I did at the Wharton Moneyball Academy, a sports analytics program for high school students. For now, sports analytics have not had nearly the same impact on football as on other sports like baseball. This is largely due to the nature of the sport. Unlike baseball, every football play involves contributions from multiple players from the same team. Thus, most statistics are representative of more than one player’s actions, making it hard to isolate and evaluate player performance. However, the fourth down dilemma is a rare area where statistical analysis has produced a concrete conclusion: coaches should be far more aggressive on fourth down.</p><p>This idea has yet to have real game impact due to resistance from NFL coaches. However, initial resistance has been common in most sports, even statistics oriented ones like baseball, and may subside as time passes and sports analysis technology improves. Former Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher was quoted saying, “It's easy to sit there and apply a formula, but it's not always the easiest thing to do on a Sunday. There's so much more involved with the game than just sitting there, looking at the numbers, and saying, 'OK, these are my percentages, then I'm going to do it this way,' because that one time it doesn't work could cost your team a football game, and that's the thing a head coach has to live with, not the professor.” However, what coaches like Cowher do not realize is that their ignorance and resistance toward the hard facts may end up costing them points, and even games.</p><p>With several respected data analysts at Wharton, I studied in depth the simple question: What should coaches do on the fourth down? It is conventional for coaches to punt the ball on fourth down from most positions on the field. It’s a somewhat risk-free play, but studies suggest that it may be better to go for it in many situations. The majority of these studies revolve around the concept of net expected points. They examine how many points teams are likely to score or allow based on their decisions on fourth down situations. These expected points numbers are calculated by multiplying the probability of one outcome by the amount of points lost or gained and adding that number to the product of the probability of the alternative outcome and the points lost or gained. This analysis takes into account factors such as fourth down conversion percentage based on field position and the number of yards left to go for a first down, as well as field goal percentage, average punt distance, and scoring percentage by field position. Looking ahead one or more drives, they do this analysis for every possible decision—punt, kick a field goal, or go for it—and with that data, extract the greatest net expected points. Whatever decision that number corresponds with is deemed optimal.</p><p>So, let’s get back to Belichick's controversial decision. The fourth and two at his own 28 yard line situation that Belichick found himself in is actually one of the three possible situations in which punting and going for it are equally effective according to the expected points model. Consequently, we must take factors such as time and score into account in order to reach a more concrete conclusion.</p><p>According to the New York Times, because it was fourth and two, the Patriots had a 60 percent chance of converting the fourth down. Given that a first down would have effectively won the game, you can start your win probability calculation by multiplying .60 by 1. Next, you must multiply the chance that they would not have converted, 40 percent, by the chance that even if they had turned the ball over on downs, the opposing team would have failed to score and the game would have been won in spite of the failed conversion. Historically, with two minutes left on the clock from the opposing team’s 28 yard line and a touchdown needed to win or tie the game, NFL teams score 53 percent of the time. Therefore, you multiply .40 by .47 and add the product to the .60 that was calculated previously. The result shows that going for it on fourth down in that situation gave Belichick and the Patriots a 79 percent chance of winning the game.</p><p>Alternatively, when teams punt from their own 28 yard line, the average punt nets 38 yards. This means that the opposing team, on average, would start their drive on their own 34 yard line. The chance of scoring from a team’s own 34 yard line in this situation is approximately 30 percent, giving the Patriots a 70 percent chance of winning if they had punted the ball.</p><p>Evidently, going for it on that fourth down gave the Patriots the best chance of winning, which means Belichick made the right call. He’s somewhat of a maverick in his departure from the conservative fourth down culture in the NFL and was met with intense criticism after the loss.

77	﻿Spartans On the Roll to Victory	spartans-on-the-roll-to-victory	<p>“We have the best overall team,” Stuyvesant Spartans coach Di Wu said. While this might seem like a pompous conjecture, considering the Spartans have won only their first two season games, they have good reason to be aiming high.</p><p>The Spartans, Stuyvesant’s boys’ bowling team, won their first game against the High School of Arts and Design at Astoria Bowl on September 29. The A and B teams both won their respective matches; the A team bowled a total of 579 pins, and the B team bowled a total of 538. Thus, the game was clinched best-of-three even before the C team took the floor. “It was a pretty normal game,” senior and co-captain Jihui Xue said. “We never lost to them last year, so it was an expected win.”</p><p>Senior and co-captain Yongfei Zheng and sophomore Samuel Fang stood out in their performances. Zheng bowled an incredible 180 for the A team, easily beating his PSAL average last year of 101. He had five total strikes; three consecutively from the fourth to sixth frames, and then three more in the ninth and 10th. “I have confidence in [Zheng in]setting the tone for others. He is consistent and brings the team’s spirits up,” coach Wu said. Zheng is one among the three juniors from last year’s B team who have stepped up to form the core group of the A team this year. Yongfei Zheng, Jihui Xue, and James Lee are co-captains and are all expected by coach Wu to bowl above a 160 average this season. He is one of the reasons Xue feels so optimistic about this season: “I feel like we’re a lot better than last year, and this time, we'll definitely go further in the playoffs,” Xue said.</p><p>“The real surprise was Samuel Fang from the B team,” coach Wu said. Fang, who didn’t even bowl as a starter last year, is now a rising star. “He practiced during the summer on his own, and had the highest score [187 pins] among the A and B team on [September] 29.” Samuel is expected to join junior teammate Lingpeng Chen to form next year’s core group.</p><p>The Spartans had their second victory against Beacon High School, again at Astoria Bowl, on October 5. Again, the game was taken by the A and B teams’ back-to-back wins. All members of the A team were solid and won by a total of 651-436. The B team won by a total of 525-412 and saw an incredible feat by senior Wesley Chen, who bowled a 189.</p><p>Looking forward, Coach Wu expects the Spartans to repeat their performance as division champs this season. However, the team’s goal is not just to win the division, but also to climb higher on the PSAL ranking. “PSAL ranks teams based upon the highest number of pins scored each game,” Wu said. “If we can score north of 170 pins, we will be ranked in the top 16 teams in the NYC.” The Spartans will then once again make it to the playoffs, but ideally as a higher seeded team. With the higher seeding, the next step would be to avoid the superior Staten Island teams early in the playoffs, perhaps playing them in the quarterfinals while hosting home games. “Though we’re good enough for our division, the whole team would have to improve collectively if we have any hopes of defeating the Staten Island teams,” Lee said.</p><p>Coach Wu has emphasized to his players the importance of closing frames (a strike or spare), as the following throw after a closed frame is added bonus points. “If all frames are closed, players can pretty much score a 200 in every game,” Wu said. Fang is a prime example of this. In the first game, Fang closed all his frames except in the tenth, which accounted for his high score of 182.</p><p>Composure and mentality are also vital, and coach Wu works to keep everyone’s temperature at a good level during game management. “All players have the capacity to bowl over 200, but they must stay confident and not get offset,” Wu said. “Players need to play their own game and not be affected by other players or their previous frames. In bowling, you compete against yourself. It's you and the pin. So 80, if not 90 percent is mental.”</p><p>“The strength is that the team is very close knit. Among them, there is friendly competition, and everyone drives each other forward,” Wu said. “We have the best overall team. Other teams may have a few good players, but we are the best, from top to down, one through eight. If other teams want to beat us, they have to beat us all.”</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:31:54.97739	24	1	The Spartans came away with an easy 2 first wins, looking to sweep the division, and continue to bowl higher to be seeded higher in the playoffs with their strong team.
79	﻿Major Wins For Peglegs After Rocky Start	major-wins-for-peglegs-after-rocky-start	<p>Stuyvesant’s boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, is sustaining a four-match winning streak after its loss to long time rival, Martin Luther King Jr. High School, in their first game of the season. The Peglegs are currently tied for second place with Washington Irving High School in Manhattan’s A1 soccer league, an improvement from the third place standing that the Peglegs have held for the past two seasons.</p><p>In September, three of the Peglegs’ games were postponed due to high temperatures and unavailability of fields, a few out of the 27 other matches postponed throughout the city. This trend is likely to continue as the league directors struggle to find enough locations for the games.</p><p>The Peglegs came back strong however, with a 1-0 win against Julia Richman Education Complex High School on September 22. This was followed by a 3-0 win against Washington Irving High School five days later. The Peglegs continued their successes with a 2-1 win in their second match against Julia Richman this past Sunday.</p><p>The loss of their initial game motivated the Peglegs to change their tactics, optimistic for a different outcome against MLK in their match on Friday, October 6.</p><p>“The fact that we were able to compete with the reigning champions just showed us the potential of the team, and we haven’t lost since,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said.</p><p>Since then, the team has been working on dominating the ball and keeping the ball in play. This motivation has led to an increase in focus among players during practice while preparing for the rematch against MLK. “After the loss, we practiced possessing the ball, communicating and passing the ball out of the backfield,” coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>Junior Robert Nava has played a crucial role in the team’s recent success and is currently leading both the team and the division in goals, having scored eight out of the team’s nine total goals in its past five games. Sophomore Jeremy Moller scored the other goal for the Peglegs.</p><p>Other players have also been critical to the team. “Seniors Simon Carmody and Tymur Kholdynak have been aggressive players and true warriors on the field,” Miller said. Senior goalie David Power, with 36 saves in just five games, is the final barrier of the Peglegs.</p><p>“The team is doing really well this year,” Nava said. “Most of the goals I've scored so far have been from through balls or long balls over the defenders. I think if [we] continue to do what we're doing, then we'll have a good chance to make it far this year,” he said. As the season has progressed, the team has progressively increased its shots on the goal. In their first game, they shot four attempts at the goal and have shot 18 in some of their more recent matches, a statistic potentially pointing to future wins for the Peglegs.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:41:34.947958	24	1	The Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, maintains a winning streak, despite multiple match reschedulings and an initial loss.
353	﻿Regina Spektor at Radio City	regina-spektor-at-radio-city	<p>Regina Spektor walked onto the stage timidly and sat down at the piano bathed in blue light. After taking a sip of water, wiping her hands on her jeans, and clearing her throat, she began her first song, “On The Radio,” a funky but simple ballad about an unknown person. The entirety of Radio City Music Hall was silent, listening to her clear voice, crisp piano, and instrumental accompaniment bounce off the high ceilings. When she finished, the hall erupted in applause and she laughed, smiling widely.</p><p>Singer and songwriter Regina Spektor visited Radio City Music Hall on March 11, 2017, as a part of her tour, promoting her recent album “Remember Us to Life.”</p><p>Before the concert, viewers eagerly awaited Spektor’s arrival and chatted about their favorite Spektor songs, concerts they had already been to, and their expectations for the following concert. The lighting was bright, beaming onto the famous red curtains of the music hall and bouncing off of the high, layered ceiling onto the packed orchestra seating and crowded balconies. Though there were a few younger kids sprinkled throughout the audience, most of the crowd ranged from 30 to 50 years old.</p><p>Despite the age difference, I had great conversations with other audience members. The special thing about going to a concert, or any gathering of the sort, is being with people who share similar interests. A love for Spektor’s style—a mix of slow, soft songs with the occasional fast and lively song—brought everyone at the hall together and made for an easy conversation starter.</p><p>As the red curtains parted and gave way to the piano, Spektor walked on stage. She was incredibly nervous throughout her performance and even had to start over during one of her songs because she was so choked up. “I’m sorry—it’s just—Radio City Music Hall, you know?” she said before restarting “Grand Hotel,” this time with more power and confidence.</p><p>In another personal moment she shared with the audience, she called her mom while on stage. It was the first home show her mom hadn’t attended because of illness. She phoned her mom and had a short conversation, switching back and forth between her native Russian and learned English. Although in her 30s, at that moment, Spektor seemed like a much younger performer who needed her mother’s assurance. Afterwards, Spektor chuckled and said, “Wow, I thought that only happened in movies!”</p><p>Spektor’s alto voice sounded exactly the same as her recordings, strong and clear. Even songs that sound like there could be some autotune, like “Bleeding Heart,” sounded almost exactly the same, if not better. I stared, amazed at her talent, as her voice rang out. During some songs, her voice sounded quiet and soft, but in other songs, it was powerful and needed limited instrumental accompaniment. Not only does Spektor sing and write most of her own songs, she also plays the piano like a virtuoso, her hands skimming quickly over the keys.</p><p>She was accompanied by a few other musicians on the drums and the bass under multicolored strobe lights that changed pace depending on the tempo of the song. During the fast songs, like “Don’t Leave Me [Ne Me Quitte Pas],” the lighting was frantic, with rapidly changing colors and about 10 spotlights shining on Spektor. However, during slow songs, like “Sellers of Flowers,” the lighting was soft and simple, sometimes with just a single beam of light. The lighting helped emphasize the beats of the songs, which made the audience members get even more into singing or humming along.</p><p>The audience spent the entire show soaking up her beautiful lyrics and natural voice, her pleasant disposition, and funny moments. Listening to music through headphones can never beat the experience of seeing a performer in person and seeing the actual hard work and talent that goes into every song. After a night full of cheers, singing, and laughing, Radio City Music Hall was buzzing with praise for Regina Spektor.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:54:41.274478	16	1	Regina Spektor performed at Radio City Music Hall on March 11.
355	﻿Freshmen Starting College Hunt Early	freshmen-starting-college-hunt-early	<p>Most freshmen tend to have no idea about college, let alone the college admissions process. Even some Stuyvesant seniors do not fully grasp the idea of college. “Wait, we graduate to go to school again? I thought college was just four years of sleeping to recuperate from Stuy,” senior Alec Dai quipped.</p><p>Exceptions always exist at Stuyvesant (like that complex seven class program change that took 273 parent phone calls), and this year, freshmen have begun to beat the juniors at the college game. They’re taking “starting early” to a new level.</p><p>1) College tours this year have significantly changed. Due to the increased number of freshmen attendees, upperclassmen attendance has severely waned, except for expert freshmen hunters. “The last college trip was packed with so many freshmen that I actually had to talk to them,” junior Jason Kao remarked. “At some college, a bunch of fratters called Stuyvesant the ‘school of the dwarves.’”</p><p>2) Have you wondered why your college counselor meetings are so late this year? It’s because freshmen have been barging into the college office and demanding a meeting with a college counselor. The demand has been so great that the college office now has a maitre d’, along with buzzers. These inquisitive freshmen have also arranged for alumni interviews and signed up for college e-mailing lists. Colleges are no longer comparing students to other students of the same age, deciding to accommodate freshmen in their admissions processes.</p><p>3) For the first time, teachers have began to write college recommendations for freshmen, diminishing the opportunities for juniors. “I’m only writing 15 junior recommendations because the freshman are just so much better at being juniors,” social studies teacher Victor Greez commented. “They’re actually awake in class.”</p><p>“I’d be willing to write for any freshman, even if I didn’t know who he or she was,” chemistry teacher Gabriel Ting expressed. “They are just so cute and perfect.” It’s not surprising that this year’s junior class slams the panic button when anything college-related is mentioned.</p><p>4) Many freshmen have started their own clubs: the “I Have Created This Club For College Interviews Club,” the “Northwestern Bay of Biscay Marine Biology Research Internship Prep Club,” and the “Insert Name Here Club” to name a few. These ambitious freshmen have overwhelmed the room booking system, causing general mayhem after school. To accommodate, the SU has opened up space in the elevator shafts, on the roof, and in the staircases.</p><p>5) Principal Eric Contreras has proposed a new change to the current grade levels. Freshmen who demonstrate college preparedness will be able to accelerate automatically to junior year and have access to coveted AP waivers. As a result, freshmen have begun to sell these AP waivers on the Stuyvesant Black Market, not that it exists...</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:55:37.57361	5	1	
65	﻿Conforming to and Subverting the Stereotype	conforming-to-and-subverting-the-stereotype	<p>“We’re so smart”</p><p>Conform:</p><p>It is true that the Stuyvesant population lives up to many of society’s typical markers of intelligence: Our standardized test scores are much higher than average and the colleges attend are generally highly selective.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, societal markers like these ignore the intricacy and diversity of intelligence represented at Stuyvesant. Not every Stuy student fits the mold of hard-working and academically high-achieving. Almost all of us have at least one weak subject and many of us don’t maintain a high average, or struggle on standardized tests. There are subjects and topics in which we flourish (though are sometimes undervalued, such as social or artistic intelligence), and subjects where we feel as though we don’t live up to Stuyvesant’s expectations.</p><p>Test-Oriented:</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Tests are known to be a big part of a Stuyvesant student’s life, but some go as far as to say we are defined by them. Of course, this is not a stereotype without merit; every day, the Dear Incoming Facebook groups are flooded with posts from students asking how to do well on so-and-so’s test and study guides shared by overachieving individuals. In fact, one of Stuyvesant’s biggest organizations, ARISTA, encourages its members to upload study guides for all students to use. This drive for doing well on tests is eminent throughout Stuyvesant culture.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, tests are far from defining Stuyvesant students. Boasting over 200 clubs and pubs and 32 varsity teams, Stuyvesant encourages students to participate in extracurriculars that range from the Photography Club to the cross country team. SING!, one of the events students are most passionate about, shows we can enjoy school without being consumed by exams.</p><p>Emotionless:</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Students may seem emotionless, as seen by the lack of school spirit and the sense that we don’t care for each other outside of our friend groups. If a physics test fell on the day after a homecoming game, most students would choose to stay home and study; in fact, even if there were no tests, most students still wouldn’t go.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Still, students are often empathetic and supportive, as shown through organizations like Big Sibs, where upperclassmen advise underclassmen, and the Dear Incoming Facebook groups, which are full of support and advice.</p><p>Cut-throat Environment</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Stuyvesant has gained a reputation as a cutthroat environment where students frequently aim to undermine each other to further their own academic success. While it may be true that almost all Stuyvesant students strive to academically achieve, this generalization ignores the fact that support can be found for all who seek it at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Class Facebook groups abound for students looking for guidance and homework help, and services such as ARISTA and the Writing Center offer further student-sponsored help. Students truly root for each other’s success and celebrate each other’s victories, as evidenced by the true sense of community following college acceptances.</p><p>STEM-y</p><p>Conform:</p><p>On the first day of school, it is not uncommon to hear stories of summers spent volunteering at hospitals, coding, or working at labs from fellow students. This emphasis on STEM has become a key aspect of Stuyvesant’s reputation and is confirmed not only by the rigorous STEM related courses Stuyvesant offers, but by students themselves. In fact, according to the recent freshmen survey conducted by the Spectator, 52.1 percent of freshman currently want to enter a STEM-related field.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, while in name Stuy might be regarded as a STEM-heavy school, in reality, the humanities play a just as important role in student life. One need only look at the English department, which is arguably the strongest at Stuy, to see the administration places a huge emphasis not just on STEM, but on creating well-rounded students. Even the students undermine this stereotype. From the intensity with which students commit to the arts during SING! to the fact that  the four largest organizations at Stuy, Speech and Debate, The Spectator, Big Sibs, and the SU, are humanities oriented, it is clear that while Stuyvesant does provide ample opportunities for STEM-oriented students, humanities are taken just as seriously.</p><p>Condescending</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Stuyvesant students are often proud that they are part of the top three percent of SHSAT takers. However, sometimes this pride manifests itself in the form of condescension. Stuyvesant students commonly joke about our next door neighbor, BMCC. On report card day, students can be heard lamenting that they’ll “only get into BMCC.” Students who gain admission to SUNY universities often denigrate their future school.</p><p>Unfortunately, this stereotype is largely true within the student body. However, we should keep in mind that the SHSAT was only one exam, and that we should avoid outwardly projecting our sense of superiority to students of other high schools and colleges.</p><p>“Everyone” is Depressed</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Stuyvesant students are overwhelmingly conscious of their mental health, often taking mental health days to relieve pressure. Several students have been hospitalized for emotional or mental instability, and some even transfer schools. The necessity of having extensive mental health support  (SPARK, a social worker, etc.) is evidence of our community’s ongoing battle with depression.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Despite this, it only takes a day at Stuyvesant to see that the average student finds something to love here. There is a distinction between stress and depression.</p><p>Just Another Quiet Asian</p><p>Conform</p><p>Everyone knows the “quiet Asian kid.” The one who takes the back seat in the classroom, shuffles in and out wordlessly, and ducks his or her head when the teacher looks for volunteers. When these students walk across the stage at graduation, their peers question whether they even attended Stuyvesant. There is a hint of truth in the notion that Asian students seem to be meek, quiet individuals who get lost in the crowd, otherwise known as the “quiet Asian” stereotype. Many traditional Asian families do choose to emphasize values of respect and quiet reflection, which, when translated into a school environment, tend to manifest themselves in observant, but quiet students.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Yet attributing the stereotype to culture or upbringing alone is an incredibly parochial way of looking at Asian students. Look more closely at the 74 percent Asian population at Stuyvesant and you will see students actively subjugating the quiet Asian stereotype by pushing themselves to raise their hands, try out for the debate team, and apply for leadership positions. In this sense, the debilitating stereotype becomes a challenge that Asian students rise to meet and overcome. However, we should not devalue students who do “conform” to this stereotype. From the classroom where participation determines up to 20 percent of your grade, to a society that values who you know over what you know, the “quiet Asian kid” faces an uphill battle. At a school so predominantly Asian, we should be the first to take steps to not perpetuate this discrimination and acknowledge these students as valuable members of our community.</p><p>Cheaters</p><p>Conform:</p><p>The cheating scandal in 2012 sent a shockwave through not only the Stuyvesant community, but through New York City public schools as a whole. As a result, Stuyvesant has received a poor reputation when it comes to academic honesty, and this year’s senior survey doesn’t help that stigma, as 70.9 percent of the class of 2018 has admitted to participating in some form of academic dishonesty.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, Stuy is not alone when it comes to this fact. Students throughout New York City public schools routinely cheat, but it’s the academic prestige of Stuyvesant that makes it a larger and more publicized issue. The rigorous curriculum and competitive atmosphere at Stuyvesant bring out the worst in many, but that doesn’t mean 70 percent of seniors, or the entire school, are defined by this.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 21:25:31.658085	8	1	The Editorial Board analyzes the extent to which Stuyvesant students conform and subvert to its stereotypes.
82	ESPN Does Not Have a Liberal Bias, it Merely Respects Free Speech	the-spectator-sports-issue-3	<p>If I ever want to see highlights from a walk-off home run, a Hail Mary, or a buzzer beater, I know to turn to ESPN. The undisputed leader in sports television broadcasts an incredible amount of content every day from tennis tournaments to NASCAR races. Flamboyant personalities like Stephen A. Smith lock horn on First Take, while intricate NFL tactics are broken down on NFL Matchup. Simply put, it is a sports fan’s virvana that runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This makes the recent allegations of liberal partisanship against ESPN even more alarming. Sports are supposed to be the last refuge from the political conversation that has roiled households across the United States.</p><p>Nestled inside deeply democratic Bristol, Connecticut, allegations of liberal bias within ESPN make sense. It is owned by Disney, whose CEO is a Democrat. Jemele Hill, a prominent African-American host of SportsCenter, recently called Donald Trump a “white supremacist” on her private Twitter feed. A media firestorm soon ignited, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying Hill’s tweet was “a fireable offense.” Conservative outlets rallied to this cause, saying that Hill’s comments were wrong and offensive toward the President and the U.S. as a whole.</p><p>However, ESPN’s critics failed to recognize the basic rights Hill is entitled to as a private citizen. Free-speech laws in the Connecticut State Constitution say that a company cannot fire its employees for exercising their First Amendment rights. Moreover, Hill should be allowed to express her own views. She didn’t say anything about Trump or politics on air at all; this was merely her private Twitter feed.</p><p>As a counterpoint, conservative commentators have noted ESPN’s dismissal of Curt Schilling, who was fired for highly prejudiced comments about transgender people he made on social media. But Schilling’s comments crossed the line between opinion and bigotry. He posted an extremely offensive meme accompanied with a grotesque description of transgender people. If Jemele Hill started making comments like this, then ESPN would be right to fire her as well. This was not Schilling’s first run-in with politics and ESPN either: he compared Muslim extremists to Nazis and said Hillary Clinton should be buried under a jail for her e-mail usage.</p><p>Similarly, ESPN fired radio host Colin Cowherd for calling Dominicans dumb. These comments sparked widespread outrage for insulting a whole ethnicity and for demeaning the level of intellect required to play baseball.</p><p>ESPN does accept conservative commentators as well as liberal commentators. Just look at Will Cain: he’s an “arch-conservative,” as described by Wikipedia, and has been a contributor to E:60 and First Take. In an appearance in Real Time with Bill Maher, Cain denied the existence of climate change, saying people who believe in it are “intellectually dishonest.” This is an absurd comment, but it’s not discriminatory or harmful. As long as a person is not a blatant bigot like Curt Schilling, ESPN has consistently protected personal free speech.</p><p>Data supports ESPN’s claim that it does not have a liberal bias as well. In a research study conducted in May 2017, conservatives gave ESPN a score of 7.2 out of 10, while liberals gave ESPN a score of 7.0 out of 10. Conservatives and liberals alike both watch and care about sports. ESPN would be foolish as a business to alienate a major segment of their consumers, especially as the rate of cord-cutting increases in the United States.</p><p>Michael Jordan once said, “Republicans buy shoes too,” when asked to endorse a Democrat in a political campaign. He sold his shoes to everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. This rings true for ESPN as well: they are the Worldwide Leader in Sports, not a political organization, and they do not pretend to be one either. It makes sense for ESPN business-wise to limit political speech as much as possible if such speech turns away viewers. Yet ESPN has also protected the free speech rights of its employees to the best of its abilities, even if it was not advantageous to do so. The balance between principles and profit is tough, but ESPN has handled this well despite being used as a conservative bogeyman for political correctness.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:45:40.813613	6	1	ESPN does not have a liberal bias, it merely respects free speech.
85	Way Too Early NBA Award Predictions	way-too-early-nba-award-predictions	<p>This off-season was one of the most exciting in history as multiple big-name players were shuffled around. We saw the Minnesota Timberwolves add experienced players in Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague and the Oklahoma City Thunder get All-Stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony for role players. The Cavs also got some steals by acquiring veteran Dwayne Wade and former MVP Derrick Rose as their backup point guard.</p><p>And of course, there was the blockbuster Kyrie Irving-Isaiah Thomas trade, and the Celtics have paired up Kyrie with Gordon Hayward. There were countless players switching jerseys as more and more teams are trying to build super-teams like the Golden State Warriors have. Super-team or not, every organization is going to be gunning for the championship trophy, and every player is going to be eyeing these awards.</p><p>Most Valuable Player: Kawhi Leonard</p><p>Kawhi Leonard has proven himself to be a superstar, keeping the San Antonio Spurs a contender year in and year out. Averaging 25.5 points and almost two steals, he showed himself as a force to be reckoned with on both sides of the court and helped the Spurs get the second seed last season. With no other superstars on the team, he will have free reign much like Westbrook did last season, and because the Spurs will rely on him heavily, he will win MVP.</p><p>Rookie of the Year: Dennis Smith Jr.</p><p>Dennis Smith Jr. has an immense amount of natural talent with his explosive driving and finishing ability that I would compare to Westbrook’s. He also has a decent shot at 36 percent from the three-point range. He displayed his skills by averaging 18 points in the Atlantic Coast Conference and being named ACC Freshman of the year in his one year at NC State. But the biggest advantage he has over his competitors, like favorites Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum, is that he is playing on a team without any young talent to carry the team forward. Instead, the Mavericks have seasoned veterans like JJ Barea and Dirk Nowitzki that can help him improve his game. He is a dark horse, but he has enough talent and will receive enough playing time to win the ROTY race.</p><p>Most Improved Player: Myles Turner</p><p>Though the Indiana Pacers might lose more games this season than last year, Myles Turner will have a chance to improve his stats. He averaged 14.5 points on 51 percent shooting on a team with Paul George. He has a nice jumper and can play the pick and roll well, so with George gone, he can flourish on a team where he is the primary offensive option. All of his numbers will go up, giving him a chance to steal the MIP award from some of the bigger names.</p><p>Sixth Man of the Year: Derrick Rose</p><p>Yes, I think that the former MVP will be the best bench player in the NBA. It is safe to assume that Rose will become the backup point guard as soon as Isaiah Thomas is healthy, who has a hip injury and is likely to return by December. A seasoned player who was MVP not too long ago and averaged a respectable 18 points and four assists on a dysfunctional Knicks organization is sure to produce efficiently for the Cavaliers. He is, hands down, the best bench player in the league and will prove that this upcoming season.</p><p>Defensive Player of the Year: Draymond Green</p><p>Green is one of the essential pieces of the Warriors. His most important asset is that he can run the floor and guard all five positions as a big man and does it with a force that can even be over the top sometimes. He averaged 2.0 steals and 1.4 blocks last season and was first in Defensive box Plus-Minus and second in defensive win-shares. He is more well-rounded than his competitors and will bring the same intensity he brings every year.</p><p>Coach of the Year: Gregg Popovich</p><p>Coach “Pop” is one of the greatest coaches of all-time, with a streak of 20 consecutive winning seasons. He creates a great locker room environment for his players and runs a spaced out offense that gets every player involved. This type of offense led the San Antonio Spurs to 61 wins, clinching the second seed in the West with only one All Star on his team. He has a defense-first mindset that had the Spurs ranking third in defense last year. This year, his team has added Rudy Gay and still has veterans like Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Pau Gasol.

193	﻿Golden Gate Tides: The Rise and Fall of Colin Kaepernick	golden-gate-tides-the-rise-and-fall-of-colin-kaepernick	<p>Before he took a knee, before he was benched, and way before he led the San Francisco 49ers on an improbable Super Bowl run in 2013, I had already gotten acquainted with the strong, scrappy quarterback who was Colin Kaepernick.</p><p>I first became acquainted with Kaepernick’s play in 2010, when I had the privilege of watching him make mincemeat of Kellen Moore’s Boise State Broncos during an improbable November comeback.</p><p>Though I never had an eye for evaluating talent, especially at the age of ten, there was still something about Kaepernick’s game that made me think, “Hey, this guy can play.”</p><p>Among the jungle of marginal quarterback play that is college football, Kaepernick stood out. Standing at 6’4 with a live arm and the speed of a wide receiver, Kaepernick was rightfully drafted high by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2011 National Football League (NFL) Draft.</p><p>The 49ers had an established quarterback in Alex Smith, but it was obvious that the team needed a breath of fresh air from Smith’s monotonous, uninspiring style of careful play.</p><p>With a frightening defense that featured linebackers Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman both in their prime, they needed a more explosive option to lead their offense over the hump; Kaepernick was their man.</p><p>However, since his two playoff runs, Kaepernick’s career has taken an unfortunate turn for the worse after his past two seasons, which have been all but disappointing.</p><p>No collapse happens overnight. Rather, the seeds for disaster are sown years in advance, and everything bubbles below the surface before coming to fruition. For over a year, there had been a power struggle between head coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Trent Baalke that finally boiled over when Harbaugh was forced out in favor of organization favorite Jim Tomsula. Under the new regime, Kaepernick struggled immediately, posting an ugly four-interception performance during the Week 3 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>However, not all the problems were with Tomsula’s incompetent coaching. The death knell to Kaepernick’s dominance came as a result of shifting offensive and defensive schemes. For his three years of success with Harbaugh, Kaepernick had become a master of the read-option running scheme, an offense only previously known at the college level until Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, and Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins all made it popular in 2012.</p><p>However, 2015 was a different time. It had been three years now, and the read option offense was but a relic, with quarterbacks forced to adapt (like Wilson) or fail (like Griffin). In Kaepernick’s case, he still had the tools to succeed, but the rapid culture shift from Harbaugh to Tomsula likely stunted his growth as a pocket passer.</p><p>As a result, he was hung out to dry in what became a disastrous 2015 season, and culminated in a disgraceful benching for Jacksonville Jaguars’ castoff Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick eventually won the job back, and he actually played soundly in Kelly’s ball control, tempo offense. However, in the end, he left the 2016 season, and the 49ers, with more questions than answers. His play was only adequate at best, and, beyond the questionable play, character concerns had also been piling up ever since Harbaugh’s departure.</p><p>After catching fire from teammate NaVorro Bowman for posting a picture of himself in a Miami Dolphins hat online in the offseason after the 2014 season, he seemed to lose the trust of his locker room.</p><p>Then, the biggest uproar came before the 2016 season, when Kaepernick decided to make a political statement. In light of recent police brutality, Kaepernick openly professed support for movements like Black Lives Matter, and then he truly stirred up controversy by refusing to stand during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner before games, a move that many conservative voices saw as disrespectful.</p><p>However, the last straw came as Kaepernick seemed to profess support for the late former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and actually wore a shirt with his image, a move that many saw as insensitive.</p><p>Now, for Kaepernick, the future looks cloudy. Though he opted out of his contract and into free agency, the free agency period is two months in and Kaepernick is still unsigned, leading some to get suspicious. Early in the free agency period, the NFL has seen a number of inferior quarterbacks earn rich contracts, from veterans like Josh McCown to spunky youngsters like Geno Smith. With Kaepernick still on the market despite having the best resume, talk has started that Kaepernick has been “blackballed” by the league, with reasons ranging from his play to his politics and even going as far as race.</p><p>In all likelihood, however, that is far from the truth. The fact is that Kaepernick is not the only talented player that stayed on the market for a long time. Adrian Peterson and LeGarrette Blount are both powerful, accomplished running backs with some time ahead of them, with the former ranking among the best in the league before injuries, age, and a suspension derailed his tenure with the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p>To say that any of these players have been “blackballed” is ridiculous, since they have both performed adequately of late. The problem is simply lack of demand at the price that Blount, Peterson, and Kaepernick are likely asking at. Kaepernick, Blount, and Peterson have been starters for most of their careers, and have likely been looking for starting positions along with “starter money.”</p><p>For Kaepernick, the situation is similar. At 29 years old, and with a more limited skill set than fellow free agent quarterbacks like Tony Romo, Kaepernick is an unfortunate “tweener” when it comes to his role. Though he would win a starting job on numerous teams, including the Rams, Browns, and Jaguars, all three of these teams have younger developmental options at the position.</p><p>On the flipside, many other teams have established veteran starters that would relegate Kaepernick to a strict backup role. Having been a starter for his entire career, it is unlikely that Kaepernick is simply willing to resign to a year on the bench quite yet. However, with most starting roles already filled, the chance of Kaepernick getting a starting offer is very slim. So, he waits.</p><p>As for Kaepernick’s off-field concerns, while defending a brutal dictator is insensitive, it pales in comparison with the literal rap sheets of other free agents, past and present, ranging from Greg Hardy to Ray McDonald to even the aforementioned Adrian Peterson. All three of these free agents have been signed to a free agent contract at one point or another, despite crimes as severe as child and domestic abuse. So, to call Kaepernick unsignable is unfair.</p><p>Even the argument that a backup quarterback cannot be a “distraction” is unfair, as there are numerous controversial backups in the NFL right now. Seattle Seahawks’ backup quarterback Trevone Boykin, for instance, is still on the roster despite multiple offseason arrests and frequent media attention, and is nowhere near the player that Kaepernick is. At the end of the day, this should just be perceived as a financial dispute, as anything more would be hypocritical and irrational by front offices.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:47:10.211361	6	1	Despite success early in his career and tantalizing physical talent, quarterback Colin Kaepernick is still unsigned.

Here are some notable costumes from last year.</p><p>Stranger Things</p><p>Senior Daniel Knopf as Will</p><p>Senior Michela Marchini as Eleven</p><p>“[Senior Michela Marchini] just called me one day and was like, ‘Hey, we should do Stranger Things for Halloween,’” senior Daniel Knopf smiled as he recalled last year’s Stuyloween when his girlfriend told him that they should dress up as Will and Eleven from Stranger Things.</p><p>The couple was really into the hit Netflix series at the time. They originally wanted to do the whole cast with their friends, but everyone else bailed. As a result, the costumes ended up being a couple’s look.</p><p>Knopf and Marchini went on a shopping adventure together to make their costumes.  “I did a lot of Amazon shopping with my mom and thrift shopping with Daniel for the costumes,” Marchini said. “We bought all the pieces separately and tried to piece them all together.”</p><p>Though the costumes were pieced together, Marchini and Knopf did their best to imitate the ‘80s look. Marchini even went as far as drawing Eleven’s nosebleed and brought in an Eggo pancake box. Her mom, who is rather artistically talented, helped in the making of some of the props in the costumes, like the radio Knopf was holding.</p><p>The couple received a lot of compliments from their friends and even random people on the street.         Last year was the first year Marchini and Knopf dressed up together, since they started dating a month after Halloween the previous year.</p><p>Up</p><p>Junior Taylor Choi as Russell</p><p>Junior Maryann Foley as Carl Fredricksen</p><p>Dressing up for Halloween has always been a tradition for junior Taylor Choi and junior Maryann Foley. They chose Up. Both of them are fans of Disney, and they were looking for an iconic duo to dress up as, so the characters of the heartwarming movie, Up, seemed perfect.</p><p>Though this was the first time Choi made her own costume, she expressed that though the process was a bit time consuming, it did not require much skill. She spent about two hours making the sash out of brown felt she got from Michaels the night before Stuyloween. It was a tedious process because she had to print and cut out 20 different badges and glue them on the sash individually.</p><p>Foley went through a similar process as Choi. However, unlike Choi, Foley actually had experience making her own costumes. As for last year’s costume, she just used clothes from her closet, with the exception of the bowtie, which she borrowed from a friend. To imitate the grape soda pin Mr. Fredricksen has in the movie, she painted an old bottle cap. Lastly, to construct the house, she simply cut balloon shapes out of construction paper and glued them to a cardboard. Foley even surprised Choi on the day of Stuyloween by bringing in a dog balloon, which represented the Golden Retriever, Dug, that Russell owns.</p><p>Yet, even with the “dog“ beside her, many people could not figure out which character Choi was dressed up as and mistook her as a girl scout. On the other hand, Foley’s costume was much more obvious. People recognized it immediately and liked it very much.</p><p>These compliments came at a cost. “There were just a lot of times that I had to awkwardly maneuver through crowds,” Foley said. “I once got stuck in a doorway because I forgot that I had the house on my back.”</p><p>Mermaid Man (from Spongebob)</p><p>Sophomore Ayham Alnasser</p><p>Despite his parents’ saying that Halloween is “Satan’s birthday,” sophomore Ayham Alnasser insists on dressing up for Halloween every year. Normally, he goes for the cheapest costume he can find at Rite Aid. However, last year, he decided to try something more out of his comfort zone.</p><p>“It was my freshman year, so I wanted to make a name for myself,” Alnasser explained. “So for the most comedic purpose, to get more kids to ‘vibe’ with me, and because Spongebob is overdone, I chose to be the Mermaid Man.”</p><p>Since he couldn’t find someone to be Barnacleboy, Alnasser went solo. He spent well over five hours stitching the costume himself. He pre-planned the costume in his head and used Youtube tutorials like “How to Sew” and “How to Choose Correct Materials.” Overall, it cost around 30 to 40 dollars.</p><p>Looking back to the day of Stuyloween, Alnasser revealed that he did not get much reaction from people, despite wearing a bright orange tight suit. Nonetheless, he did receive great reactions on his Facebook post online, where he discussed his costume.</p><p>Alnasser also participated in the annual Halloween costume contest that the Student Union hosts and won in the “Best Overall Costume” category. Not only did he manage to continue his tradition of dressing up for Halloween each year, but he also received a $15 Chipotle gift card.</p><p>Trump’s Wall</p><p>Junior Elisey Goland</p><p>When junior Elisey Goland walked into his chemistry class with a “Trump Make my Hair Great Again!” cardboard sign hanging on his neck, he received mixed reactions from people. “Some people thought I was promoting the wall and got mad. Others thought I was against the wall and got mad,” Goland explained. “But most people found it humorous.”</p><p>Though it was only a week from the election, making a political statement was never Goland’s intent. He just thought it would be fun to be the Wall.  “A friend of mine said he was going as Trump,” he said. “So naturally, I decided to be the Wall.”</p><p>He only spent around half an hour on his costume with supplies he bought from a local 99 cents store. Still, the “Wall” successfully showcased Goland’s satirical humor. Things like “Hola Trump” and “Made in China Trump Inc.” were written over the brick-red cardboard that he painted. To make it more realistic, Goland even drew cracks on it with a black marker.</p><p>Dressing up for Halloween is something Goland really enjoys doing with his friends. He came in as an error message, “costume not found,” and Bender from Futurama in previous years.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 07:45:48.746294	3	1	A spread on the previously done costumes last year.

A full team effort allowed Stuyvesant to dominate its opponents, as each player pulled her weight and dismantled her opponents in the process.</p><p>As the season progressed, the team’s performance continued to improve. The Lady Lobsters won two of their next three games, 5-0 against the High School of American Studies and 4-1 against Eleanor Roosevelt, with its lone loss against Bronx Science, 4-1. This run was led by sophomore Alyssa Pustilnik, who has won 42 of the 50 total games she has played for the season, senior and captain Marie Ivantechenko, who had gone 27-12, and freshman Palak Srivastava, who went 40-18 in her doubles matches.</p><p>In their past three games, the Lady Lobsters have gone 1-2, with two 5-0 losses. In their first match against Beacon High School, none of the girls were able to win more than four games, but the Lady Lobsters were able to recover with another 5-0 win against Hunter College High School. Their latest game, an unfortunate 3-2 loss against Bronx Science, stopped any momentum that they were trying to gain to make a final run before the playoffs.</p><p>With only two games left in their season, the Lady Lobsters are looking forward to the playoffs. The Lobsters lost to Hunter College High School in the second round of the playoffs last season in a close 3-2 defeat, and this year, the Lady Lobsters are looking for revenge.</p><p>“We have a really strong lineup this year,” Ivantechenko said. “Hopefully, we’re going to get further in [the] playoffs than we have in recent years.”</p><p>With strong leaders and standout players, the Lady Lobsters are a well rounded team. However, their fate may be decided by their final two regular season games. Two losses would not be good going into the playoffs, as they would be 1-4 in their last five games. On the other hand, two wins would set them up with great momentum, as they would be enter the playoffs on a winning streak. Either way, the girls on the team will have to step up if they want to become PSAL champions.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:41:21.15043	24	1	At the end of a rocky season, the Lady Lobsters are looking to finish out the season strong, going into playoffs.
80	﻿Penguins Under Pressure, Continue to Outswim Opponents	penguins-under-pressure-continue-to-outswim-opponents	<p>With the scoreboard already in Stuyvesant’s favor, junior Laura Saliy stepped up to her lane. She sprung off the starting block, jumping ahead of her competitors from her dive. By the time she finished her last lap, multiple swimmers from Hunter High School were two laps behind. Her win in the 500-yard freestyle was one of many from Stuyvesant’s girls’ swimming team, the Penguins, who have extended a streak of decisive victories with its 57-43 win over Hunter High School on October 4.</p><p>The Penguins have held a tight grip on the Bronx/Manhattan League for years. The last three seasons have seen a combined regular season record of 29-0 from the Penguins, a testament to their dominance in this division. Though their last championship came in the 2014-2015 season, every season since has featured deep playoff runs.</p><p>In fact, the Penguins’ frequent entrance into the playoffs has caused a rivalry to develop between them and the Brooklyn Tech Engineers. During the 2014-2015 season, the Penguins were able to triumph over the Engineers and win the city title, but last year, Brooklyn Tech retaliated and defeated Stuyvesant in the championship meet. Many of last year’s swimmers are eager to compete with the Engineers once again. “There are a lot of tough teams out there this year, including Townsend Harris, Bronx Science, Tottenville, Cardozo, and Brooklyn Tech. We especially look forward to possibly racing Brooklyn Tech again [as they] beat us at finals to take the championship title last season,” senior and co-captain Madeline Wong said.</p><p>While the Penguins will not face the Engineers this year in the regular season, they have a tense rivalry with another team in their division, the Bronx Science Wolverines. Many on the team were anxious about their meet with the Wolverines on October 6. “Going into the meet [against Bronx Science], we were a little nervous about not winning, but we swam incredibly and won. We out touched them in three events,” Wong said. Narrowly winning multiple events, the Penguins were still able to outscore the Wolverines 61-40 by claiming the top two places in many events, such as the 100-yard butterfly and the 50 and 100-yard freestyles.</p><p>This year, the Penguins hope to maintain their preeminence in the Bronx/Manhattan League and the PSAL as a whole. However, there is a lack of seniority on the team this year, with only five seniors and nine freshman. Despite this, the team is optimistic for the underclassmen, with many of the new Penguins impressing the captains. “We have awesome additions to our team, including sophomore Arielle Aney, who just broke 2:00 in her 200-yard freestyle during the recent meet against Bronx Science, and sophomore Emma Lee, who was MVP last year and made States in two individual events, the 50 free and the 100 free,” Wong said. Lee has already surpassed all expectations for this year, recording first place in all seven races she has competed in. This abundance of underclassmen talent will be something to note for the rest of the season.</p><p>Another point of emphasis this year for the Penguins was a coaching change in the offseason, with Ms. Silvana Choy becoming the head coach as former coach Peter Bologna became the new athletic director. Mr. Bologna, or Coach B, as he was colloquially referred to, coached both boys and girls swimming for countless years. He continues to pop up when meets are at Stuy, determined to help the teams however he can. Nonetheless, his replacement as coach was very unprecedented for the Penguins, with many finding it hard to imagine a coach for the swim team besides Coach B. “When we first found out Coach B wouldn't be our coach this year, we didn't know what to think. We couldn't imagine anyone except him coaching. However, Coach Choy quickly gained our love and respect. In the pool, she's really tough on us, but that's what makes us dedicated and fast swimmers. Outside of the pool, she's such a supportive and amazing person, and you can really tell she cares about all of us as people, not just swimmers,” Saliy said. Coach Choy has been very successful in her first month as coach, with the Penguins beating each team they’ve swam against by at least 10 points.</p><p>The Penguins are once again looking toward the postseason. The combination of a strong upperclassmen core, a rapidly developing underclassmen roster, and a new coach who has been highly effective early on makes a long playoff run highly feasible.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:42:31.674374	24	1	Recounting the Penguins’ recent victories and analyzing the changes that have occurred this year and how they affect Stuyvesant’s chances at a championship run.

They have to take ownership of their training if they are going to get faster and if we are going to have success as a team.”—Carl DiSarno, coach</p><p>As they do each fall, the Greyducks are practicing hard and gearing up for their upcoming cross country meets, but with one notable difference. The boys’ cross country team has a new head coach: Carl DiSarno. DiSarno has replaced the now retired Mark Mendes, the Greyducks’ beloved coach who was the boys’ head cross country coach from 2000 until 2016. “Even though Coach Mendes left some pretty big shoes to fill, I think I’m up to the task,” DiSarno confidently acknowledged. And DiSarno is certainly more than qualified for the task.</p><p>DiSarno, who grew up in Brooklyn and moved to Connecticut when he was 10 years old, only began to run as a high school freshman because his mother thought he was too small to play football and didn’t want him to get hurt. As DiSarno noted, his mother made the “right decision” because he proved himself to be an all-star athlete in track and field. As a high school runner, he was selected twice for the All-State team and was placed on the All-New England team as a high school senior. DiSarno then attended Fordham University on a track scholarship. While at Fordham, he mainly competed in the 10,000-meter and 5,000-meter runs and was team captain as a senior. In addition, DiSarno was twice named to the prestigious Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America (ICAAAA) All-East Team in cross country. But DiSarno remains humble about his accomplishments. “More importantly, the friendships that I made with my teammates at Fordham are what shaped me into the person that I am today.”</p><p>DiSarno is much more than an accomplished athlete; he is also a sixth-grade social studies teacher and the cross country and track coach at Robert F. Wagner Middle School in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Though Wagner is a large middle school with a track team, it did not have a cross country team. However, in 2014, the principal at Wagner allowed DiSarno to spearhead Wagner’s first cross country program.</p><p>In the short time DiSarno has been coaching Wagner’s cross country team, the Wagner middle school runners have enjoyed great success, which he hopes will also translate to continued success for the Stuyvesant cross country runners. Under his helm, the Wagner girls’ cross country team won three straight NYC titles and the Wagner boys’ cross country team won two consecutive titles. However, DiSarno considers Wagner’s win at the 2016 City Championship in spring track to be his “most satisfying accomplishment.” This win was very special to him because it was the culmination of three years of hard work for his eighth-grade athletes for whom he had started the cross country program at Wagner.</p><p>DiSarno’s pride for his athletes is apparent as he has followed their successes in their respective high schools: “That group of kids are now sophomores, and as freshmen, they won city championships, borough championships, county championships and two were even named All-Americans.” One such athlete who has enjoyed great success as a cross country runner at Stuyvesant is sophomore Baird Johnson, who had DiSarno as his cross country coach when he attended Wagner middle school and is proud to have him again. “Coach DiSarno is an enthusiastic, upbeat, even-keeled leader,” he said. “He meets each runner where they are and helps them get [to] where they want to be. He was a collegiate runner, and the experience he brings to Stuyvesant will help mitigate the loss of USATF Hall of Fame Coach Mark Mendes.”</p><p>Remarkably, DiSarno has seamlessly been able to navigate coaching both the Stuyvesant and the Wagner cross country teams. In order to be able to focus on coaching one team at a time, he continues to coach the Wagner cross country team on the two afternoons the team practices and coaches the Greyducks the other afternoons. On the two days DiSarno coaches the Wagner team, the Greyducks practice with their longstanding assistant coach and Stuyvesant statistics teacher Bernard Feigenbaum. During those two days, the Greyducks run downtown, where they are “running easy miles to strengthen their legs and build their stamina,” according to DiSarno. The Greyducks run the other three days in Central Park, where they focus on improving their speed and hill-running ability. The change in pace between training in Central Park and running downtown has helped the Greyducks gain further strength and agility.</p><p>When asked about the difference between coaching the middle school and the high school cross country teams, DiSarno’s sense of humor readily emerges: “There’s a lot less whining with high school runners, but there’s definitely more enthusiasm with middle school kids.”</p><p>Looking at the current team, DiSarno noted that because the Greyducks’ top three runners—Kiyan Tavangar, Greg Dudick and Harvey Ng—graduated in 2017, “matching last year’s success won’t be easy.” In addition, while the Greyducks have won two PSAL championships in a row, PSAL and Milesplit.com have picked the team to finish anywhere between fifth and seventh this season. DiSarno has “tried to use those predictions as motivation for the boys.” “I don’t know if we will have a front-runner this year, so it will be important to run as a pack and finish as closely to one another as possible. It’s not the easiest way to win a championship, but it certainly can be done,” he said.</p><p>But to the Greyducks’ new head coach, the team’s success this year will not be solely defined by attaining another championship. Rather, the team’s success will be defined by what DiSarno views as his coaching philosophy. “I’ve tried to let the boys know that I can only take them so far. They have to take ownership of their training if they are going to get faster and if we are going to have success as a team. Team goals aside, if every boy runs faster at the end of the season than he did at the start, then we can call that a success. And that will happen if we run as a team, pushing one another to do better.”</p><p>Senior and co-captain, Minhein Htet, echoed that DiSarno’s goal is for the runners to “[b]uild a good base and then build speed.” Htet also noted that while DiSarno “is much less intimidating than Mendes,” he “allows the captains a fair bit of autonomy, just like Mendes.”</p><p>For now, the Greyducks are training hard and hoping not only to continue the team’s winning streak, but also to improve their personal best with a faster time under the the guidance of their two coaches. While DiSarno humbly adds that he is “honored to take over such a prestigious program,” it is clear that the Greyducks are also honored to have him as their new head cross country coach.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:42:52.45741	24	1	“I’ve tried to let the boys know that I can only take them so far.

83	﻿Baseball Culture: Time for a Change	baseball-culture-time-for-a-change	<p>As I stepped up to the plate, I already knew what was coming. It was the first inning of a scoreless game and I was leading things off for our side, but my outcome had been set in stone. I was ready to be drilled by the first pitch.</p><p>Instead of going up to the plate with a mentality of “looking for the right pitch,”  I approached hoping, “don’t hit a bone, please.” Sure enough, the first pitch made a loud thud on my quad, and I didn’t quite know how to react. I was initially pent up with anger, but charging the mound wasn’t an option considering my significant weight and strength disadvantage. So I settled for an angry stare back at the pitcher. Many MLB players, however, wouldn’t have taken such a path following the same incident.</p><p>In my case, getting thrown at was retaliation for me unintentionally hitting the leadoff batter of the opposing team, so as both baseball and the mob dictate: “You hit us, we hit you.” While I never saw a single player on that team again, the same certainly can’t be said between Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Jose Bautista and the Texas Rangers, who have had an ongoing beef since the 2015 playoffs.</p><p>In the do-or-die game five of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Bautista hit what would end up being a game-deciding three-run home run. At the crack of the bat, he and the 50,000 fans in attendance knew it was gone, so he did what any human being would do at that moment—he celebrated. The moment of celebration in a bat flip—not the fact that he gave up a series-clinching home run—didn’t sit well with Rangers pitcher Sam Dyson, who remarked after the game that Bautista needed to “calm that down.”</p><p>Bautista was 34 years old when he hit the biggest home run of his career, and one of the most famous home runs in recent baseball history. About 31 years of hard work—since tee-ball—had finally paid off and turned him into an icon in Toronto sports history. And he’s supposed to calm down? If you look around in other sports, “calming down” isn’t a common theme. Cam Newton and Odell Beckham Jr. celebrate for extended periods of time in the endzone, while James Harden and LeBron James have picked up signature celebrations following big shots. But in baseball, where tradition reigns, the same tradition that kept black players out of the league until 1947 and refused advancement in the form of instant replay for decades, Bautista is in the wrong.</p><p>The Rangers would retaliate, as a bench-clearing brawl ensued on May 15 the following season, and Bautista took one in the chin from Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, Odor wasn’t the villain for punching an opponent during a baseball game. No, it was Bautista who had it coming for his moment of celebration.</p><p>He isn’t alone in being villainized. Carlos Gomez has been thrown at several times for bat flips, Manny Machado has thrown his bat at opponents after being thrown at, and Alex Rodriguez was thrown at by then-Boston Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster for steroid use, despite already receiving a suspension of over a year from the MLB.</p><p>For over 100 years, baseball has policed itself through bruises and insults at all levels. Back then, it may have been different, but today, it’s a bunch of players who are more concerned about their personal beef than winning. So, the next time I get hit, retaliation or not, I’m going to jog to first and happily take my base.

84	﻿Greyducks Struggle in Mayor’s Cup to Start Season but Remain Optimistic	greyducks-struggle-in-mayor-s-cup-to-start-season-but-remain-optimistic	<p>As the championship race neared its end on a brisk, sunny day in Van Cortlandt Park, senior and co-captain Min Hein Htet, senior and co-captain Jesse Sit, and junior Justin Zhang crossed the finish line almost in unison, out of breath, but content. Despite finishing 11th out of 24 teams, the Greyducks met their expectations and were pleased with their overall showing.</p><p>Heading into the meet, the prestigious NYC Mayor’s Cup, Stuyvesant’s boys’ cross country team, the Greyducks, was not expecting to finish in first or second place. Last year’s team placed 6th at the same event; however, its top three runners, Kiyan Tavangar, Gregory Dudick, and Harvey Ng, have graduated. This was the first race that the varsity team would be running together, so the team’s chemistry and game plan weren’t at their best. For example, senior and co-captain Matt Fairbanks was injured and did not run. Additionally, the team has not yet had enough practices to work on their speed training and hill-running strength. “We’re aiming to peak in early November, so there are some aspects of training that we’ve only just started focusing on,” first-year coach Carl Disarno said. As a result, race times for the Greyducks were slower than usual.</p><p>Sophomore Baird Johnson’s time for the 2.5-mile championship race was 14:12.1, though Disarno said that “he certainly didn’t run as fast as he is capable [of running].” Htet placed 55th with a time of 14:50.3, followed closely by Sit in 58th (14:57.8) and Zhang in 59th (15:01.1). Sophomore Oliver Cai (67th), junior Caleb Hoo (68th), and junior Steven Zheng (97th) rounded out the varsity team. Susan Wagner High School won first place in the Mayor’s Cup, while Brooklyn Tech High School and Trinity High School earned second and third place, respectively.</p><p>The team was satisfied with its performance and accomplished its goals for the event.  “My goal for this meet was to have our second through fifth runners [be] as close to one another as possible, and we only had a 23-second gap between our second and sixth runners, which I thought was great,” Sit said. “Many of us ran PRs [personal records] which is a nice start.”</p><p>The Greyducks’ captains are cautiously optimistic about the team’s future. “So far we've been doing a lot of mileage and not as many hard workouts, so in these next few weeks, we’ll be moving towards more workouts to get race ready,” Sit said. He has already set goals for the next event, the Manhattan Invite, which takes place on October 15. He hopes that Johnson’s time will be below 13:30 and that the next three Stuyvesant runners will have sub-14:30 times.  Other captains agreed with this: “By the end of the season, I'm confident we'll become faster,” Htet said. “The only way our team is going to have a shot at making states is through a deep team, which means that we need a good quantity of guys who won't lose to anyone except the stars of the rival teams.”</p><p>A main concern for the Greyducks is injury, noting that Fairbanks and Johnson are both hurt. The Greyducks “need to improve on injury prevention techniques. They need to understand that taking days off to recover while the problem is still not critical is important,” Htet said.</p><p>As the Greyducks look to improve in the next meet, Coach Disarno summed up the team’s 2017 outlook: “I think we have our work cut out for us in order to achieve our goals of winning the Borough Championship and qualifying for the state meet, but it’s not out of our reach.”</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-22 21:46:10.342834	24	1	
242	﻿The True Underdog Success of The Astros	the-true-underdog-success-of-the-astros	<p>In the bottom of the ninth inning with an empty count, Corey Seager hit a weak ground ball to second base. It was fitting that the final play of the World Series was made by none other than Jose Altuve, the American League (AL) MVP who led the Astros from an extremely disappointing season to a championship one.</p><p>Though it is tempting to see Altuve as the driving force behind this success, it is actually  because of a cultivation of five years worth of important actions. In 2013, the Astros set a franchise record for the most losses in a single season, finishing with a 51-111 record. Following that, they began to build one of the strongest and deepest teams over the past year, even without the massive budget of some of their top competitors.</p><p>Altuve wasn't the only major contributor to the team’s pennant win this year, but he was critical to the their success. Picked up as an amateur in 2007, he made his major league debut in 2011. Since then, he has turned heads for his short stature and strong play. His last two seasons have been breakout years, marking a new segment in his career. Last season, he led the league in hits and the AL in batting average, finishing in third for the AL MVP award. This year, he followed up on last years stats, topping the league in batting average and leading the AL in hits. As captain, he brings a style of play that promotes a much more relaxed and enjoyable style of baseball, rallying many fans behind the Astros this season.</p><p>The story of the Astros’ postseason success would also be incomplete without crediting George Springer. A leadoff hitter for most of the season, he was one of the Astros’ best at the plate, but didn’t reach his peak until the postseason. He hit six home runs in the postseason, three of them coming in the World Series. His power and reliability during the World Series were unprecedented, and he led the Astros with a .379 batting average and a 1.000 slugging percentage, stats strong enough to earn him the MVP for the World Series.</p><p>Springer’s success comes after three years of relatively mediocre performances since his debut in 2014. He was drafted in 2011 and was certainly not expected by the Astros to be one of their stars. Entering the MLB with a speech impediment, he spoke often about his low confidence at the beginning of his career. But he’s been able to push through his personal issues and even raise awareness. On top of this, he led the Astros to success in the World Series with numerous leadoff home runs. Both homegrown players, Springer and Altuve have developed together over the past six years and contributed heavily to the team's success.</p><p>The Astros’ homegrown talent extends beyond their hitting core. Over the past season, they have accumulated new pitchers while also transforming some of their weakers arms into stronger weapons.</p><p>One of the breakout pitchers this postseason was Charlie Morton. Prior to this year, he had been one of the weaker starters on a challenged Pittsburgh Pirates team. Not much was expected of him coming into this year; he had only one season with a winning record before. However, he defied expectations and delivered a strong 14-7 record, as well as commanding appearances in the World Series, most notably in Game 7. Dallas Keuchel, another homegrown player, was one of the strongest pitchers in the league over the course of the regular season. In the playoffs he struggled with consistency, providing some dominant performances in the ALCS and then some mediocre starts in the World Series.</p><p>But the most dominant pitcher in the entire postseason was Justin Verlander, a last-minute signing before the trade deadline. He struggled to regain his old dominance during the first part of the season. However, after he signed with the Astros, he delivered five wins on the mound without dropping a game. His performance in the postseason was even more impressive, shutting down the Dodgers, despite one loss. His signing in the fall rounded out one of the strongest pitching staffs in the AL.</p><p>This year’s success showed that an underdog team, even without a massive budget to spend, can become a champion in just a couple years. This season could blow away some teams’ notion that strict discipline is the only way to win, a principle many baseball fans have struggled with over the past few years.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:01:00.509551	6	1	Coming from some of the worst seasons in franchise history, the Astros have since developed homegrown players, culminating in this year’s World Series Victory.
354	﻿Autistic Kids are Welcome on Sesame Street	autistic-kids-are-welcome-on-sesame-street	<p>A new character is moving onto the iconic children’s television show “Sesame Street” this April, and she has lessons for kids who were formerly nowhere to be found. Red-haired Muppet Julia is Sesame Street’s first autistic character.</p><p>Julia was first introduced in an online storybook as part of an initiative on the Sesame Street website. The site encourages visitors to “see amazing in all children” and provides resources teaching about autism and how to raise autistic children, including “daily routine cards,” which detail social behavior and testimonials from autistic people and their families. However, the initial release of Julia was met with some criticism from the autistic community. Some found the usage of “person first language” (saying “person with autism” rather than “autistic person”) patronizing and criticized the usage of testimonials from autistic people’s families over testimonials from autistic people themselves. Many also called out how Autism Speaks—a prominent autism advocacy organization that has faced huge backlash for portraying autism as a disease to be eradicated—was listed as a resource.</p><p>While some of these criticisms are valid, the announcement of Julia officially joining the cast has been received warmly. It is rare for an autistic character to become an official cast member of a major TV show, as they usually only exist for one episode to teach a lesson about autism. The network has stated that Julia will become a recurring member of the main cast of this landmark children’s show; if she is portrayed as a character who happens to have autism rather than a “token” character who only exists to teach about autism, it will be a major step forward for the entertainment industry.</p><p>Julia made her official television debut on April 10, on HBO, but there are also several videos available online featuring Julia, both animated and in muppet form. These videos demonstrate several of her autistic behaviors: flapping her hands (known as “stimming”), delayed responses to her friends, limited speech, and not looking people in the eye. However, she is never demonized for her symptoms. Whenever characters are concerned about Julia’s behavior, Elmo explains politely that Julia is autistic and thus communicates differently from most, and the characters agree and accommodate to her needs when playing with her. Julia’s autistic traits are even put in a positive light in some cases. In one animated short, Julia is playing “I Spy” with Elmo and Abby Cadabby and is able to find the tiny red object that Elmo wants her to because of her strong attention to detail—a common autistic trait. In a live action short, Julia doesn’t respond to Elmo when he asks her to play. Without hesitating, Elmo happily decides to play next to Julia instead and reminds the viewer that “there [are] lots of ways friends can play!”</p><p>Like any other character on the show, Julia is just as quirky as the real children who will watch her on television. While this might not sound too important for a character on a children’s show, in Julia’s case, it’s groundbreaking. By definition, a “token autistic character” exists only for the purpose of being autistic, instead of being a three-dimensional person. Julia may only be a puppet, but she has a three-dimensional personality that comes through in the videos featuring her that have already been released. In one of these clips, Abby Cadabby blows bubbles and reveals that Julia loves popping them. In another, Elmo mentions that Julia’s stuffed animal “Fluffster” is her favorite toy. In both videos, Julia says only a few words—implying that she’s nonverbal. At the same time, her friends are always happy to talk to her. Watching this, children at home can learn that autistic people are complex and internalize the idea that being friends with autistic kids and making an effort to communicate with them when they express themselves differently is not only great, but normal.</p><p>Like other children’s shows, “Sesame Street” is meant to teach young children basic life lessons and skills. Every plotline and character provides some insight into how to learn new things, how to make friends, how to resolve an argument, how to be kind to others, how to shake hands and play with other children, and other common skills. The mainstream media is accepting that knowing how to understand, befriend, and respect autistic people is important—important enough to teach the next generation that, right along with the ABC’s.</p><p>One progressive aspect of Julia that can be easily overlooked is her gender. The fact that Julia is an autistic girl is its own leap forward and can fight common misconceptions about who autism affects. There is a notable lean towards autistic boys and men in the media, and autism is significantly underdiagnosed in women—the original definition of autistic psychopathy by Hans Asperger didn’t even include women or girls as affected. Including more autistic girls in media, like Julia, should be celebrated. It reminds people that autism is not a “boy’s disorder” and lets young autistic girls see themselves represented.</p><p>“Sesame Street” is no stranger to exposing children to reality in a mature fashion. They’ve had episodes dealing with pregnancy and birth, death of a loved one, bullying, poverty, and cultural pride. Julia isn’t even the only groundbreaking character to come to the street this year, as another new Muppet, Alex, has a father in jail, providing support for children with incarcerated family members. Many children’s shows would shy away from these topics, but “Sesame Street” is using its mainstream popularity to take a few risks.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:55:07.400632	17	1	An overview of “Sesame Street’s” new muppet Julia and how well she represents autism.

Oktoberfest, a Bavarian festival, runs from mid-September to the beginning of October. It is one of the world’s largest folk festivals and gives visitors the opportunity to eat traditional food while enjoying numerous activities.</p><p>Stuyvesant’s Oktoberfest celebration, which was held in the cafeteria, strived to showcase German culture. German and Bavarian flags were hung up. “There was German music playing in the hallway all day long. There were German songs, poetry, and videos. There was lots and lots of German food,” Assistant Principal of World Languages Dr. Ernest Oliveri said.</p><p>German teacher Rebecca Lindemulder was in charge of planning and organizing the event. “We wanted to give the German students a chance to experience a bit of German culture first-hand and participate in a long-standing Bavarian tradition,” Lindemulder said in an e-mail interview. “We wanted to open it up to all students in order to educate our fellow students on the festival and also give everyone the chance to experience German culture and Gemütlichkeit, the concept of coziness, contentedness, comfort, and relaxation, and enjoying a good, fun time with friends with food and drink, all together.”</p><p>Many German students also helped prepare for the event by making decorations and cooking food. “At Oktoberfest we had Bratwurst, Chicken Schnitzel, Frikadellen, Kaesespaetzle (something close to a German version of mac and cheese), potato pancakes, sauerkraut, potato salad, apple cake, and a few other things,” Lindemulder said.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri and Lindemulder were generally pleased with the enthusiasm students showed at the event. “Everyone was having a good time and there were many people there,” Dr. Oliveri said. They are planning to continue holding it in coming years.</p><p>The foreign language department has plans to have many more cultural events. Some of the upcoming events include “Día de los Muertos” on November 1 and 2, a performance by the German band “Die Lochis” on December 4, and Japan Day on May 3. “[The goal is] to bring more culture and exposure to the students of Stuyvesant,” Dr. Oliveri said.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:12:28.051882	1	1	An Oktoberfest celebration was held in the cafeteria on October 16.
88	﻿Caribbean Catastrophes Unite Stuyvesant	caribbean-catastrophes-unite-stuyvesant	<p>Students and faculty came together to hold a two week-long fundraiser to provide aid for Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, following the recent natural disasters that occurred there. The fundraiser began on Wednesday, October 4, and ended on Friday, October 20.</p><p>In September, Mexico was struck by an 8.2 magnitude earthquake and a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, killing hundreds of people. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were devastated by Hurricane Maria, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, in the same month. One month later, many of these areas are still facing a humanitarian crisis.</p><p>The fundraiser started as a collaborative effort between SPARK, Spectrum, Stuyvesant Key Club, the world languages department, and the Sophomore and Senior Caucuses. The Senior Caucus spearheaded the effort with SPARK Coordinator Angel Colon and Spanish teachers Pasqua Rocchio and Anna Montserrat and approached the Sophomore Caucus and individual clubs to involve more students. “We were very supportive of the idea, as was the entire [Student Union (SU)], and so the drive became a co-effort,” Sophomore Caucus President Vishwaa Sofat said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Volunteers collected cash donations and basic supplies from students on the second floor. The flags of Puerto Rico and Mexico and posters advertising the drive were set up throughout the school. Blurbs about the fundraiser were also included in the newsletters sent out by Parent Coordinator Dina Ingram and the SU.</p><p>Many other clubs and organizations collaborated to help the fundraiser, as well. Spectrum sold stickers and pins to raise awareness for the LGBTQ+ community, and donated all proceeds to the drive. ASPIRA, Stuyvesant’s Hispanic culture club, donated all profits from their Hispanic Heritage Month Dinner to the cause.</p><p>The Sophomore and Senior Caucuses will send the money to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which will then be used to help rebuild impacted communities. “UNICEF is known for their humanitarian emergency aid. They have projects set up [in the] areas of disaster to make sure affected families have the resources, especially water and hygiene support,” Sophomore Caucus Vice President Eve Wening said.</p><p>Key Club is working simultaneously with New York and Puerto Rican partnerships to see that the physical goods are shipped to the affected areas and distributed.</p><p>The Sophomore Caucus hopes to use this experience for future fundraisers. “Initially, we weren’t sure how much money we would collect, but the Stuyvesant population proved to be generous and active citizens in the global community,” Sofat said.</p><p>“After seeing how successful this fundraiser was we have more confidence moving forward, and hopefully, Stuyvesant can continue to help those in need across the world,” Wening said.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:12:08.10439	1	1	Students and faculty worked together to hold a relief fundraiser for Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Virgin Islands, following recent devastation in the areas.
356	﻿What Really Goes Into Your College Rec	what-really-goes-into-your-college-rec	<p>So after 10 hours of preparing a pleading speech and 10 more of on-the-floor begging, your teacher has finally decided to write you a letter of recommendation for college. Congratulations!</p><p>There are a variety of recs that your teachers can write, and it’s important to know which one will be written on your behalf so you know what to expect.</p><p><b>The “Why X” Recommendation:</b></p><p>These recommendations sound a lot like the college-specific supplemental essays you will write.</p><p>Instead of talking about “world-class faculty” and “a diverse student body that partakes in a variety of activities,” your teachers will speak highly of your “frequent contribution to class discussions” and “demonstrated curiosity in the field.” In fact, your teacher probably uses the same template to write the recommendation just like how they use the same handouts from 2004.</p><p><b>The Snake Recommendation:</b></p><p>Snake recommenders aren’t asked by students often, so when they’re asked, they know that you’re desperate to get into college.</p><p>Much like a snake, these teachers will sense your hopelessness and capitalize on it by including everything negative about you. They will include a log of every time you arrived late (with attached late slips), used a phone (with secret photographic evidence), or incorrectly answered a question when they called on you.</p><p>Snake recommenders are initially hard to spot, but once you have a class with one, it becomes very obvious. They will never give points back on a test even when they admit they are wrong, assign group projects on a whim, and try to be funny but actually end up making the entire class uncomfortable.</p><p><b>The Gas Recommendation:</b></p><p>This recommendation is 10 percent luck, 20 percent skill, 15 percent concentrated power of will, five percent pleasure, 50 percent pain, and 100 percent bravado for even considering to ask for a recommendation.</p><p>It’s mostly painful for this teacher to write you a letter of recommendation. You and your teacher both know that you finessed this class as much as you finessed in asking for a recommendation.</p><p>However, this teacher is a bro and isn’t about to do you dirty. Therefore, this teacher will attempt to “gas you up” for college admissions and exaggerate every interaction he/she has ever had with you.</p><p>It’s too bad that colleges will see right through it. It’s too bad that colleges won’t ever see your “whimsical and striking ability to attend class lectures despite being slouched over, snoring.”</p><p><b>The Unicorn Recommendation:</b></p><p>These recommendations are rarer than girls accepting my promposal. If you find a unicorn recommendation, pick the college of your dreams because that will be a college you’ll get an acceptance from (unless it’s MIT).</p><p>Unicorn recommenders are easy to spot. They’re incredibly laid back and you make sure not to take it for granted. You have a genuine interest in the subject they teach and can share a laugh with them on a daily basis. These teachers will pack their recommendations with anecdotes that illuminate your wholesome personality.</p><p>Teachers that give unicorn recommendations include Mr. Sandler and Mr. Strasser. I am forever thankful for their support and apologize if there is a significant increase in students asking them for recommendations this year.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:55:59.680354	5	1	Teachers can provide a variety of letters of recommendation for college.

92	﻿Computers and Costumes	computers-and-costumes	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>With gaping, circular mouths, fist-sized eyeballs, and draping robes, the Computer Science department transformed into multicolored martians: Sesame Street’s very-own “Yip-Yips.”</p><p>Last year, the department came together to bring these fascinating characters to life, shopping together and actually creating the costumes after-school. “We stayed at school until 8 p.m. There was a lot of felt. And a lot of hot glue strings in the office,” Computer Science Coordinator JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver recalled.</p><p>While these costumes may have been a little more avant-garde than usual, dressing up as a department is a long-standing tradition. In 2014, the year of the office-supply superheroes, Dyrland-Weaver was a stapler, Topher Brown Mykolyk was a ruler, Yulia Genkina was an eraser, and Samuel Konstantinovich was the “unspecified” villain (after all, even office-supply superheroes need a villain).</p><p>They usually create the costumes the weekend before Halloween—not too early and not too late. “Last year was the first year where there was a mass constructing of the costumes. We had glue guns and scissors and things,” Dyrland-Weaver said.</p><p>The original idea to dress up together was developed by former Computer Science Coordinator Michael Zamansky who began dressing up for Halloween even before Dyrland-Weaver was a student here. “I believe his goal was generally to have the students understand a bit of his personality—to get to know their teacher in a different light,” Dyrland-Weaver explained.</p><p>Having a teacher wear a fun costume would be a way for the students to get to know the teacher in a different light. “It’s good for students to understand a little bit of who I am. We’re in a room together for 40 minutes for five days of every week. We see each other a lot! In order to have a good educational experience, it’s important that I understand that our students are people who are not just doing computer science. They should understand that I’m a person, and I think humanizing the teacher is good for students in the same way I would like to humanize the students so that I know them better,” Dyrland-Weaver said.</p><p>Before this tradition was established, only Zamansky put on a costume for Halloween. One year, he dressed up as Bob Ross, painting during his classes. In fact, one of the paintings he made still hangs in room 307.</p><p>Another year, he came as Homer Simpson. “He was yellow. He came in with a white polo shirt, blue pants, yellow body, with the right amount of stubble and a shaved head,” described Dyrland-Weaver, remembering the costume from when he was a student in Zamansky’s class at Stuyvesant. “I knew Zamansky was goofy, so I wasn’t surprised, but it was very funny. He taught the entire class as Homer, which was also great.”</p><p>When Dyrland-Weaver came back to Stuyvesant as a teacher, he was asked to be a part of the new Stuyloween tradition. “Since I was a former student of Zamansky’s, he basically told me that my job as a computer science teacher was contingent upon me joining him in the Halloween tradition,” he said.</p><p>Throughout the years, as the Computer Science department grew, there were more and more teachers participating and donning a costume. Despite Zamansky leaving Stuyvesant in 2015, Dyrland-Weaver and his colleagues decided to continue the tradition.</p><p>Genkina, who very recently left Stuyvesant, had been a part of the costume tradition. “She was a wonderful addition to our crew, and she was thrilled [about] the costume tradition. Honestly, if we didn’t have one, I bet she would’ve started it,” Dyrland-Weaver said. “I’ve actually told her she should come back here on Halloween. She did not immediately reject the idea.”</p><p>One of Dyrland-Weaver’s favorite costumes includes when he and Zamansky took the costume of infomercial personalities; Dyrland-Weaver was Vince Offer (the Shamwow/Slapchop guy), and Zamansky was Billy Mays (the OxiClean guy). “We tried to sell our students the products. We also came up with products of our own,” Dyrland-Weaver said. One of them was the Grade-Gone™, which was basically just white-out for a really bad grade on a test. The Advanced Grade-Gone™, had a red pen taped to it, so that you could put a new grade on. “It was just a lot of fun. There are videos of these online,” Dyrland-Weaver noted.</p><p>A costume that involved extensive preparation was when Dyrland-Weaver and Zamansky decided to dress up as the Blues brothers. “We watched YouTube videos and learned the song and the dance,” Dyrland-Weaver said. “Doing a song and dance for every period of the day was exhausting, though.”</p><p>The longest part of the process is figuring out what the theme will be. “Being Stuyvesant people, we procrastinate, and then it’s October, and it’s like, what are we going to do? Eventually, we do figure it out,” Dyrland-Weaver said.</p><p>For ideas and themes, the department decides on an idea that would interest everyone. “The stupider the better,” Dyrland-Weaver said. However, there is one unspoken rule that everyone obeys: no repeats. No matter what costume they decide to put on, there shall never be a repeat of a costume done in a previous year.</p><p>Usually, they just e-mail ideas to each other and stay after school to discuss ideas further. This process is very secretive: anyone outside of the computer science department will not know what the theme is until the day of. “We can’t talk about what we do to people who overhear,” Dyrland-Weaver joked.</p><p>“No comment,” Dyrland-Weaver insisted when I asked what exactly they would dress up as this year.</p><p>“I am not sure that I am at liberty to discuss the details of this clandestine organization,” Brown Mykolyk added.</p><p>Computer Science Department Costumes</p><p>Year</p><p>Costume Theme + Participants</p><p>2008</p><p>Blues Brothers (Dyrland-Weaver and Zamansky)</p><p>2009</p><p>Infomercial Guys</p><p>Vince Offer (Shamwow/Slapchop guy): Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Billy Mays (OxiClean guy): Zamansky</p><p>2010</p><p>Austin Powers</p><p>Dr. Evil: Zamansky</p><p>2011</p><p>Benders</p><p>2012</p><p>Swedish Chef (from The Muppets)</p><p>Zamansky, Konstantinovich, and Dyrland-Weaver did variations of Chefs in honor of Richard Geller, a math teacher</p><p>2013</p><p>Star Trek</p><p>Bones: Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Captain Kirk: Zamansky</p><p>Spock: Konstantinovich</p><p>Scottie: Brown Mykolyk</p><p>2014</p><p>Office Supply Super Heroes</p><p>Stapler: Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Ruler: Brown Mykolyk</p><p>Eraser: Genkina</p><p>Villain: Konstantinovich</p><p>2015</p><p>Inside Out</p><p>Anger: Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Joy: Zamansky</p><p>Sadness: Konstantinovich</p><p>Disgust: Brown Mykolyk</p><p>2016</p><p>Sesame Street Martians</p><p>Genkina, Khevelev, Brown Mykolyk, Konstantinovich, and Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>*** Note that 2008 was not the first year of the costume tradition; it began long before that, even before Dyrland-Weaver was a student.</p><p>Video Links:</p><p>Link to the Halloween Playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KxKa8NpFxJYgovyJhF4HZRsAqYKBLiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KxKa8NpFxJYgovyJhF4HZRsAqYKBLiG</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 07:46:08.027539	3	1	With gaping, circular mouths, fist-sized eyeballs, and draping robes, the Computer Science department transformed into multicolored martians: Sesame Street’s very-own “Yip-Yips.”

For many people, this extra money would go a long way. Now consider that this money would not come at anyone’s financial expense. While this may sound too good to be true, this figure is the average amount the Trump administration’s tax plan would save families in the 95th percentile of income earners and below.</p><p>The Trump administration has billed this proposed tax cut as the “largest tax reform” in U.S. history. The plan has come under sharp criticism from politicians and constituents claiming the tax cuts disproportionately favor the rich. Despite these criticisms, the Trump administration's tax plan would benefit people and businesses across the economic ladder.</p><p>Many liberal politicians have dismissed the tax cuts, claiming that they give the rich an undeserved break. However, the idea that the “rich don't pay their fair share” is a myth. The top 10 percent of earners was responsible for 45 percent of all taxes on income, paying an average rate of 26 percent of their income. This is in stark contrast to the bottom 50 percent of earners, who pay six percent of total taxes at an average rate of four percent. This does not suggest that the poor don't pay their fair share, but rather that the pervasive idea that the wealthy are somehow the winners of our country's tax system is erroneous. Therefore, the Trump administration’s 4.6 percent tax cut for individuals making over $418,000 a year will not unfairly skew the tax system towards the rich, but rather provide the rich with tax relief that will encourage them to reinvest into society, and in the process benefit people across the economic ladder.</p><p>The single most influential change to tax policy is the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to either 15 or 20 percent. While this may seem to be a handout to large multinational corporations, upon closer rumination it is anything but that. The U.S.’s corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the third highest in the world. The most obvious consequence of this high rate is that it encourages companies to relocate overseas.</p><p>For example, Johnson Controls, a company worth $23 billion, moved its headquarters from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Ireland in 2016. It cited the fact that the move would save the company about $150 million in U.S. taxes annually as its reason.</p><p>When a company relocates overseas, the economy loses the jobs, growth, and investment potential the company possesses. This is a lose-lose situation for both the American government and the American consumer, as they both suffer the effects of reduced investment, job availability, and economic growth.</p><p>A high corporate tax rate also incentivizes companies to store their earnings overseas in order to avoid heavy taxation. A study by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that “untaxed foreign earnings of American companies totaled approximately $2.6 trillion in 2015.” The same study found that if a corporate tax cut were offered to these companies on the condition that they returned this cash back to the U.S., $663 billion would be reinvested into job growth and business expansion in the United States.</p><p>Not only will the proposed reform stimulate American corporations to stay wholly American, but it will provide some much needed relief to small businesses. A recent survey by CNBC indicated that the number one concern for business owners is their taxes; a whopping 42 percent believed that a tax break as large as the one offered could have a tremendously positive impact on the small business economy.</p><p>Currently, mom-and-pop shops across the U.S. pay a rate from 15 to 40 percent of their individual income rates. The repeal of Bush-era tax cuts left businesses reeling at added expenses in a crippled economy. The newest tax reform would offer a uniform 15 percent tax rate regardless of their affiliations, such as partnerships, sole proprietors, or freelancers. This tax reform leaves millions of small business owners with a larger profit and additional revenue that could be used to reinvest into the company.</p><p>Opponents claim tax cuts would reduce funding toward essential government programs surrounding public health, medical research, climate change, etc. However, less money doesn’t mean these programs will become obsolete. For each one, there’s almost always a political backer willing to advocate for the program’s necessity to the national government and fight to keep it viable, even with reduced funding. The Heritage Foundation finds that there are somewhere from 79 to 140 federal programs currently fighting to reduce poverty, each with overlapping incentives.</p><p>For instance, historian Allen J. Matusow of Rice University wrote that Medicare and Medicaid have done considerably little to benefit the quality of living for the elderly (one of their main objectives), serving instead to raise health care costs for taxpayers. With an annual price tag of about $600-900 billion on their own, Trump’s intention is to eliminate spending where it’s wasteful, not vital.</p><p>American ideals boast diligence, entrepreneurship, and a sort of blind aspiration that’s produced some of the most brilliant minds in history. However, this enormous capacity for innovation is often limited by a single materialistic thing: money. Tax cuts are essential for this competitive economy to combat the relocation of American corporations and stimulate the rise of small businesses, the crux of our national pride. The public is done vouching for an exhausted agenda: they need to see some real tax cuts, real soon.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:20:57.152065	2	1	Tax cuts are essential in this competitive economy to combat the relocation of American corporations, and stimulate the rise of small businesses, the crux of our national pride.
94	﻿School Counselors and Students: A Necessary Therapy Session	school-counselors-and-students-a-necessary-therapy-session	<p>At first glance, school counselors have a very straightforward goal: to offer academic and emotional support to their students during high school. This includes handling course requests, writing the Secondary School Recommendation (SSR) for colleges, and checking up on their students’ mental states and home situations. School counselor Undine Guthrie summarizes this, saying, “The guidance office is a place where you can go to get tons of information to help you achieve whatever you need to accomplish.”</p><p>Yet the counseling department at Stuyvesant might not fully support all students. Only 41 percent of Stuyvesant students surveyed reported that their school counselor was helpful in terms of emotional support. This is despite the counseling department’s attempts at being more proactive and encouraging their students to come to them for guidance. For instance, counselors have mandatory meetings with their respective homerooms or meetings with small groups of students during freshman year. The problem is that these mandatory meetings with school counselors are usually not individualized, instead addressing a freshman homeroom or a group of students as a whole.</p><p>Besides these prearranged meetings, counselors also face the issue of not always being physically in their office. In order to remedy this, the counseling office implemented a “buddy system,” which allows students to visit a different school counselor and talk to them if their school counselor is unavailable at the time.</p><p>The “buddy system,” however, overlooks the connection and familiarity all students should ideally have with their school counselors. The system is problematic for some students because they may be uncomfortable to talk about their personal and academic matters with another adult, especially one that they do not have a personal connection with. Junior Maya Furusho notes, “ I feel like it’s not the same when you talk to a school counselor that’s not your own.” This becomes an issue when a student has a personal issue and needs counseling, but does not feel comfortable talking to a school counselor.</p><p>In light of some of these shortcomings with a program that has the potential to help so many students, it’s clear that the counseling department needs to implement more concrete and uniform measures in order to help students feel more comfortable around school counselors. All freshmen should have at least one mandatory one-on-one meeting scheduled with their school counselor. An individual meeting can ensure that school counselors have a chance to break the ice with freshmen and check on their transition from middle school to high school.</p><p>Past that first individual meeting, the counseling department should implement an online system, similar to the one currently used by the college office, for making appointments with school counselors. This would make it easier for students to find a time to visit their own school counselors because school counselors can easily post and notify students when they are available in their office during school hours every day of the week online. Students would be able to schedule appointments based on their school counselor’s availability and provide their reason for visiting.</p><p>This system would be convenient for both students and school counselors. Compared to the current e-mail based system, an online system would be able to clearly indicate when school counselors will not be busy during the week. This would give foresight to school counselors about why students want to visit and holds school counselors accountable for creating and keeping appointments.</p><p>Once students arrive for their scheduled meeting, counselors should also take the initiative of making their offices a welcoming place. When asked about factors that deterred her from getting closer with her school counselor, Junior Camilla Cheng commented, “Sometimes my school counselor has people [upperclassmen] hanging around his room and I get nervous [...] I don’t know how to approach him.” School counselors need to be able to adapt for shyer students and make themselves more approachable.</p><p>In order to make themselves more approachable, school counselors need to make sure that their offices are inviting by asking upperclassmen to hang out outside their offices in the counseling suite. This prevents upperclassmen from deterring students to visit their school counselors, which should be done in private.</p><p>But ultimately, when it comes to improving the effectiveness of Stuyvesant’s guidance program, a part of the responsibility falls on the students’ shoulders. About 28 percent of surveyed Stuyvesant students reported that they visited another school counselor because they claimed that they knew their school counselor was unhelpful or had previous bad experiences with their school counselor. School counselor Paul Goldsman notes in an interview, “A lot of the things we do are intangible and can’t be seen and a lot of people think that we’re just doing nothing and sitting in front of a computer when in fact I can say with 100 percent certainty that that is not the case.”</p><p>Students must realize that school counselors do a lot of “behind the scenes” work, such as organizing the freshman seminars implemented this year by the counseling department as a way to help freshmen with their transition into Stuy. It’s imperative that they are as open as they can be with their students about what they can do to make sure that their students can get all the information they need or want.</p><p>Underclassmen especially should take advantage of the new Big Sib program this year, which requires Big Sibs to meet with their Little Sibs’ counselor and offer helpful information on individual students to the school counselor and encourage students to visit their school counselor more often.</p><p>The guidance system is far from perfect. But as Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey Pedrick noted in an interview, “We [school counselors] would really love it if the students could come in and introduce themselves to their school counselor. You can just come and say hi or come and talk to us and ask us and it can be positive, negative, a crisis, a high five, or a hug.”</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:21:35.923318	2	1	Stuyvesant school counselors need to be more proactive in being able to provide adequate support for their students.
95	﻿Our Changing Climate: Is Now the Time?	our-changing-climate-is-now-the-time	<p>Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a category four hurricane, with winds over 155 mph, leaving 100 percent of the island without power on September 20th. These winds, rainfall, and heat were translated into a mix of waste-water, floodwaters, and trash in the streets, surgical operations performed in sweltering 95 degree weather, and a lack of waterborne-disease-free water. As the third strongest storm to ever hit US territory, Maria has done some irreparable damage. This has not been exclusive to one hurricane—over the course of this summer, the world has fallen victim to some of the worst major natural disasters in history.</p><p>The intensity of these hurricanes can be accredited to climate change, as NASA finds a global temperature rise, warming oceans, glacial retreat, and extreme events correlate with the recent influx of carbon emissions from industrialization. These effects of climate change are also contributing factors to extreme events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and floods. According to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, higher temperatures from the global temperature rise account for increased moisture in the air. For every degree Celsius increase, the percentage of moisture in the air increases by seven percent. Though this may seem like an insignificant digit, in the context that 2016 was the hottest recorded year in history, with eight months breaking records of the highest temperatures, the seven percent increase may suddenly become a 14 percent spike. It has been recorded that the waters of the Gulf of Mexico have increased 1.5 degrees from 1980—these subtle changes may be the culprits behind this year’s raging hurricane season. Just a 0.5 increase in temperature could result in a catastrophic hurricane, fed by the increased moisture in the atmosphere.</p><p>Climate change correlates with the onset of amplified natural disasters—however, skeptics of climate change have deemed even mentioning it as a cause as “insensitive” and “tasteless,” raising the question of the appropriateness of discussing climate change in light of all that has been going on recently. But if we're not going to mention it now, when?</p><p>In such a time of distress, it does seem relatively inappropriate to start finger-wagging—coverage should indeed be aid and rescue-based and based on spreading awareness, not political views. However, that is not to say that climate change should altogether be censored from news networks. In fact, despite this being heavily opinionated and political news, this plight needs to be addressed immediately, as it is an imminent danger to our world.</p><p>The most natural response to such disasters would be to reconsider rebuilding infrastructure and energy sources near bodies of water or coastal plains or other regions severely damaged by the hurricanes and floodwaters. However, such a response is only a short-term solution. We are really only beginning to scratch the surface of dealing with future disasters. By addressing these issues on a shallow level without considering the long-term effects of climate change, we are choosing to look through a limited scope. In reality, we must acknowledge the root of the issue and call for effective reform by cutting carbon emissions and establishing precautionary measures to reduce the damage next time, as per the Paris Agreement. By failing to do so, we are placing ourselves in the path of impending doom.</p><p>The current administration is going out of its way to evade the discussion of climate change, whether or not it is in the context of the recent hurricanes. In April, the EPA removed mention of climate change from its official website, and it is planning to repeal carbon dioxide emission regulations. Trump is also in the midst of repealing the Clean Power Plan, an emblem of the reform Obama had pushed for in his presidency. Others, such as Governor Rick Scott of Florida, have evaded the term so much that in order to pass certain bills or acknowledge certain discoveries, scientists must have “climate change”-free proposals or findings for him. At this point, the scientific community is subject to the power of the politician rather than the scientific method. Science has become a customizable political tool.</p><p>It shouldn’t be this way. In a period of indifference, these hurricanes are finally gaining attention, warning skeptics that the truth they’ve been censoring may have an effect on them. They may finally become the victims, and that makes all the difference. Now, discussing the potential causes of recent hurricanes is no less appropriate than discussing issues on gun control after a shooting—rather, it will never be more appropriate.</p><p>In order to address and face the consequences of these natural disasters, we must prioritize understanding and addressing the scientific causes behind them to educate the public, call for reform, and potentially prevent future instances. Without increased awareness in the public regarding their direct impact on the environment, this subject may never come to see the light of day, and it will become forgotten.</p><p>In light of Donald Trump’s rejection of all ideas “climate change” related, this is also a huge opportunity for scientists to finally take a stance and use current events in the world as evidence to further support the existence of climate change. The President has no issue with calling out issues related to immigration because it does not hurt big American business. Just remember that there will be no America, let alone business, in a world ravaged by preventable natural disasters.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:22:00.538129	2	1	But if we're not going to mention it now, when?

He is the first student to ever serve in this position. Social studies teacher Linda Weissman is Cruse’s co-chair. Cruse already serves as Student Union (SU) representative for the SLT.</p><p>The SLT is comprised of parent representatives from each grade, administrators, and a student representative, who gather monthly to discuss issues at Stuyvesant and propose changes.  This year, because of the resignation of former chair and senior parent representative Julie Brown, the chair position was open. “Normally other teachers or parents will take [the position] on because it is a lot of work. This year, I put my name in the ring,” Cruse said.</p><p>The chair is chosen by the SLT members by vote. “[At] the first meeting, they hold open elections, in which someone can nominate themselves or someone else, and you have a vote on it,” Cruse said.</p><p>The chairs of the SLT set the agendas and take minutes for each meeting. “I help decide what is going to be talked about at meetings and meet with [Principal Eric] Contreras,” Cruse said. “I think once we have it down to a rhythm, [there] won't be that much added to the regular SLT duties.”</p><p>As SU representative, Cruse gives students a voice in SLT meetings. Cruse, with the assistance of his alternate junior Joshua Weiner, meets with caucuses to discuss changes desired by students and presents them to the SLT.</p><p>Cruse believes that having a student hold the role of chair will bring more issues to attention. “Students want to talk about certain issues, such as PSAL frees, or how last year we wanted to come back in earlier when it was really cold, but it would be hard to get them on the agenda,” he said. “If there is ever a really pressing issue for the school, I can modify [the agenda].”</p><p>Many students are pleased about Cruse’s new position. “I think it’s great [Cruse] is the co-chair of the SLT. Students should [be more involved] because we are the ones who are actually being affected by all of the changes,” junior Lauren Ng said.</p><p>Cruse is excited about this new challenge. “I just hope that this will help change Stuy and make it better for students,” he said.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:12:17.83158	1	1	Jack Cruse has been named co-chair of the SLT, the first student in this position.
167	﻿Breaking Down the Eagles’ Postseason	breaking-down-the-eagles-postseason	<p>Losing does not come easily to a champion; a team that establishes a dominant, winning tradition has a hard time breaking it. Such was the case for Stuyvesant’s varsity golf team, the Eagles. “The team was pretty devastated,” coach Emilio Nieves said of the Eagles’ semifinals loss. After consecutive city championships and two consecutive seasons without a single loss, the team faced a tough end to the season.</p><p>With matchups against powerhouses in Hunter College High School and Eleanor Roosevelt High School, chances for Stuyvesant to regain the top slot were bleak. Though the Eagles took the match against Roosevelt, they were forced to forfeit the Hunter match, leaving them at a 5-2 record and in fourth place in the Manhattan League. With their first non-undefeated season in three years, the Eagles would no longer have the luxury of the top playoff seed and an easy matchup.</p><p>Last year, the Eagles faced Leon M. Goldstein High School (5-4), and were able to eliminate them, winning 4-1. This year, Stuyvesant faced Goldstein again, but in much different circumstances. As the 10th seed, and with an impressive 8-1 record, Goldstein was due to pose a challenge for the Eagles. However, like in the win over Roosevelt, the Eagles set the tone right off the bat with a hot start. Through the first three holes, nobody on Stuyvesant’s starting five posted a single total of over six strokes.</p><p>Additionally, the back end was dominant once again, particularly in the cases of senior and No. 3 golfer Kevin Zheng and freshman and No. 4 golfer Alexander Camaev. Neither of those two matches was particularly close; over the course of the match, Camaev and Zheng combined for just one hole of over six strokes. For contrast, Goldstein’s No. 3 and No. 4 golfers put up just one hole of under six strokes. From the beginning, the Goldstein match mimicked the previous victory against Roosevelt. Though it ended up slightly closer, the Eagles still finished with a comfortable 3-1 win.</p><p>With that, the Eagles were set to face their toughest challenge yet. Playing as the lower seed for the first time in four years, Stuyvesant faced the second-seeded Tottenville High School, who finished the season 10-1, first in the Staten Island division. In Stuyvesant’s past two victories, the team was able to coast on the dominance of its back end over unbalanced starting lineups. Tottenville, however, boasted a deep lineup—a threat to the Eagles’ usual dominance. If their first round matchup was any indication, Tottenville’s bottom golfers would be just as strong as those at the top of the lineup. In a 5-0 shellacking of Midwood, Tottenville’s No. 5 golfer, Blossom Yu, did not have a single hole that took more that five strokes.</p><p>Though Stuyvesant’s two stars, junior Christopher Chan and senior Nicholas Ng, were able to lose matches against Roosevelt and Goldstein and still see the team win, the Eagles simply could not afford for this to happen against a team like Tottenville. For Stuyvesant to advance, the team needed to get off to a similarly fast start, and to see similar dominance from Camaev and the rest of the back end once again. On top of that, Chan and Ng needed to go toe-to-toe with Thomas Sclafani and Nicholas Khoury of Tottenville. This was possible, as Chan’s regular-season nine-hole total of 34 is less than Sclafani’s of 35, meaning that a head-to-head victory was not out of the question. Yet, even with the tall odds, the team still had  confidence going into the match. “It will probably be tough, but I have faith in our team,” Ng said before the match.</p><p>Though the previous victories over Roosevelt and Goldstein can be attributed to the dominance of the back end, the Eagles’ match against Tottenville was defined by the success of Chan, Ng, and Zheng, who came through in the clutch. Chan was as strong as he has ever been, and with all six of his holes ending up at under six strokes, he made quick work of Sclafani.</p><p>Zheng was even more impressive, posting a full nine-hole match with eight of the nine holes under six strokes. Though the match went down to the wire, and despite being beaten in the nine-hole total, 44-45, Zheng’s consistency earned him a victory in the end. With a similarly spectacular performance from senior and No. 5 starter Neil Yang, the Eagles managed an improbable upset against the No. 2 seed in the city, winning 3-1.</p><p>In the semifinals, the Eagles were set for a rematch against Roosevelt. Chan seemed to have an inkling that this would happen after the first Roosevelt match: “Just beating a division rival was great for team morale, especially because we could face them in the playoffs,” he said after the regular season victory. Yet, even with team morale being as high as it was, the Eagles could not put it together in the semifinals.</p><p>While the match against Tottenville was the epitome of consistency, the showdown with Roosevelt quickly turned into the opposite. Though Yang had himself a day once again, the rest of the starting five underperformed, as each member posted multiple holes of six strokes or higher. Though the matches of Chan and Ng went down to the wire, with Ng’s in particular going into a tiebreak, the Eagles could not pull out a win and fell, losing 2-3.</p><p>Despite having been eliminated, Ng remains hopeful for the future. “A bunch of the younger players are really stepping up and I think that we’ll all keep improving,” he said. However, with hope, there also comes apprehension. Ng, Zheng, and Yang comprise three-fifths of the Eagles’ starting lineup, and are all graduating seniors. Knowing the effects of the loss of star Niel Vyas a year prior, the effect of this should once again be profound, as it is never easy to replace more than half of a starting lineup.</p><p>Though the team still has a solid core of Chan and Camaev to build around, Nieves understands the need for young talent. “A few new good freshmen would also help continue the success we have had over the last five years,” he said, showing optimism in the possibility of new prospects. Seeing that the non-starters combined for exactly one match played this season, it is apparent that inexperience is rife on this team. Ultimately, next year’s Eagles will either sink or swim depending on the ability of members to step up and on the talent of next year’s freshman crop.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:53:52.321985	24	1	After upset victories against Eleanor Roosevelt and Tottenville, the Stuyvesant Eagles’ season came to an end in a tight semifinal rematch with Roosevelt.
104	﻿Artists in the Making	artists-in-the-making	<p>Everyone with a career in an artistic field has a wildly different story to tell. From having doting parents to finding a passion later in life, there are many ways artists can find success with their interests. Particularly in New York City, the high school an artist attends can have a huge effect on his or her pursuit of a career in a creative field. Whether the student is enrolled in an arts-focused school like LaGuardia or a school like Stuyvesant that emphasizes math and science, every aspiring artist’s profession and outlook is influenced by their high school years.</p><p>One of the most important parts of achieving success in an artistic career is practice. Statistics prove that at least 10,000 hours of practice are needed to master any skill. In his book, “Outliers,” Malcolm Gladwell examines a study done on violinists at the elite Academy of Music in Berlin. Gladwell finds that “by the age of 20, the elite performers had totaled 10,000 hours of practice” without relying on talent at all. In fact, Gladwell later writes that “once a top musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works.”</p><p>“I know that I've been drawing all my life,” sophomore Anaïs Real says. She attributes her success to her many hours of practice. “I started to properly learn how to draw on my own when I was 10,” she continues. Real’s hard work pays off: she recalls that the proudest moments of her artistic career were winning Gold and Silver keys in the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards. Real also takes inspiration from her mother, who is an artist as well.</p><p>Even though art is an important aspect of her daily life, Real isn’t so sure about a career in the field. Leaning towards creating art as a stress-free hobby, she says, “Being an artist is extremely difficult, and while I love it, it's not exactly something I want to have to do in order to get paid.” With money and picky commissioners thrown into the mix, Real worries about successfully gaining an audience for her work. “Career-wise, it’s always the money. There are very finicky people who commission art, and it can be hard to please them. I don’t want to do art for some random guy; I want to do art for me,” she adds. Real’s logic makes sense. Many artists do struggle for money when starting their careers, and it’s impossible to please everyone.</p><p>As for her school’s influence, Real doesn’t feel that Stuyvesant’s STEM-focused environment has a significant impact on her art-related aspirations. “Despite [...] attending Stuyvesant, a place notorious for the sciences and maths, I would like to take art classes in college,” she says. “It probably wouldn't be a major, but I'd enjoy it as additional classes, if they are available.” Stuyvesant, she says, isn’t a huge influence on her career choice. “I've always been more interested in zoology as a career, if I'll be honest,” Real finishes.</p><p>Some Stuyvesant students do struggle to balance a heavy workload with their creative interests. “What does stress me out from time to time is balancing my work with schoolwork for the next seven years,” said Stuyvesant sophomore Grace Goldstein, who is interested in writing musicals. “Sometimes I'm afraid that neither will be the best that they can be, because I'm spreading myself too thin doing both.” Goldstein has a point: with hours of homework, it can be hard to find time to devote to preparing for an already demanding job.</p><p>Goldstein, however, is not discouraged by Stuyvesant’s emphasis on math and science. “Contrary to popular belief, Stuy is a great place for creators, performers, and artists,” she claims. “I've met some other writers and songwriters at Stuyvesant, and a few of my friends even want to write musicals, which has definitely made me more excited than ever about my career path.” With organizations like STC and SING!, it is possible for Stuyvesant students to find a creative outlet within a strenuous academic environment.</p><p>Goldstein also draws inspiration from other successful works of theater, particularly “Rent,” a ‘90s rock musical written by the late composer Jonathan Larson. Goldstein reveals that in telling the story of a group of East Village artists in the midst of the AIDS crisis, “Rent” “reminds [her] of the strength, power, and camaraderie that comes from New Yorkers in the art world.” The production’s score and dialogue inspire Goldstein’s own works. “I want to be able to write like that,” she concludes.</p><p>At school, Goldstein is comfortable associating with people who share similar interests. “It's [...] important to be around people who are passionate about the same things as you,” she observes. “Those are the people you'll want to work with as an adult.”</p><p>For some teens, practice is made easier with the help of a school that puts an emphasis on the arts. LaGuardia sophomore and aspiring singer Jeanne Bransbourg admits, “[since] I sing at school along with many others, it really encourages my passion and helps me get better and feel more comfortable singing.” With a secure group of fellow singers to commiserate and rehearse with, it does make sense that Bransbourg is pushed by her peers to achieve her goals.</p><p>Along with school, an artist’s family can be a deciding factor when it comes to the pursuit of a more creative path, especially during his or her time in high school. We’ve all heard stories of desperate and controlling stage parents that live vicariously through the success of their child. Coming from a musical family, Bransbourg is aware of the benefits of an artistic background, but she doesn’t feel pressured by her parents. Rather than being pushed to get into LaGuardia’s voice program, Bransbourg felt encouraged by her parents to look into many different high schools. “They support me and help me if I need it,” she explains.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the reasons so many teens are deterred from having a career in the arts is the daunting odds of finding enough success to make a living. “It’s very hard to pursue a career in the arts because only one in a lot of people actually make it,” continues Bransbourg, as she talks about the stresses of her chosen path. The “starving artist” trope exists for a reason, partially because of how many hopeful creatives find themselves working toy jobs to pay the bills as they begin to search for opportunities in their preferred profession.</p><p>On the contrary, Hunter College sophomore Emma Larson reveals that “it often bums [her] out that [Hunter] doesn’t offer as many opportunities to kids wanting to pursue art as opposed to, say, music or [theater].” However, she does find time to draw in her art school’s art class and cartoon club. Her school’s limited options don’t stop her from creating. “My own personal motivation and enjoyment of illustration is what really pushes me to work on my art,” says Larson, explaining how she improves her art without the help of her school.</p><p>When trying to improve and gain attention, many aspiring artists also take to heart the advice they hear from professionals. “Don't worry about getting things perfect,” Real says as she recalls meaningful tips she’s been given. “To keep my options open and to work very very hard,” Bransbourg adds. In the end, most artists find success by staying true to what they know is right for them. “Just draw what [you] love,” Larson says, “because somebody out there loves it too, and you’ll find your own way.”</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:48:29.816829	28	1	Teens from different New York City high schools talk about pursuing careers in the arts.

This figure, who declared himself to be Lord Grendall Troll, claimed to live under the Tribeca Bridge.</p><p>“For decades, I have kept my silence but after the immense and prolonged ruckus caused by the incessant little munchkin devils, I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands,” Troll said. “To have to look over at Yeezys hanging over the roof of the bridge was abominable, but this was the final straw.”</p><p>Troll has imposed many limitations on the items allowed on the bridge. Any backpacks that cannot fit into a locker shall be immediately emptied and its contents thrown into the Hudson River. When questioned about the effects of large binders and five section notebooks on the ecosystem in the Hudson, Troll replied succinctly: “Everything in that river is dead.”</p><p>Any textbooks found will be immediately donated to the Borough of Manhattan Community College. Furthermore, any student who brings a rolling backpack will be redirected to John F. Kennedy airport.</p><p>Backpack restrictions are just the tip of the iceberg on Troll’s new rules for bridge usage. He has imposed new restrictions on the elevator by limiting its usage to couples or soon-to-be couples.</p><p>Seniors have welcomed Troll, cheering him on for finally instituting well-needed changes for the bridge. They have pushed Troll to create divided walkways reserved for seniors, crossing tolls for underclassmen, and venue fees for freshman Student Union campaigns.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:23:19.652946	23	1	With backpacks that weigh several times their own weight, members of the class of 2021 stampede across the Tribeca Bridge every morning at 7:59 a.m....
69	﻿To Gay or Not to Gay: The Evolution of Queerbaiting	to-gay-or-not-to-gay-the-evolution-of-queerbaiting	<p>To gay, or not to gay? That is the question asked by producers and executives in the entertainment industry as queer representation in mainstream film and television becomes more normalized.</p><p>While onscreen appearances of queer characters used to be considered groundbreaking, risqué, and highly controversial, they are now considerably commonplace and a popular way to “diversify” a cast.</p><p>This summer alone, two blockbusters geared toward child audiences, “Power Rangers” and “Beauty and the Beast,” featured confirmed gay characters. Spy movie “Atomic Blonde” was led by queer female characters, and “Wonder Woman,” the origin story of America’s favorite bisexual superheroine, broke box office records.</p><p>While this seems to be ample queer representation, most of it only appeared in the marketing of the films and not in the actual films themselves. The only movie of these four to truly portray a same-sex relationship was “Atomic Blonde,” and it was hypersexualized to appeal to the male gaze. Moreover, the main character’s same-sex love interest, brutally killed off in a careless manner, was treated as a disposable object. Queer, especially queer female, characters are killed off in movies and television shows so frequently that there’s a name for it—the “bury your gays” trope.</p><p>In the other three movies, there was little to no queer representation. In “Power Rangers,” there were only slight implications in a brief onscreen moment that the yellow ranger could be a lesbian. The flamboyant LeFou of “Beauty and the Beast” was not much more than a messy conglomeration of stereotypes; the only actual indication of his sexuality was located in his two-second-long dance with a man in the credits. Though Wonder Woman was confirmed as bisexual by DC Comics, the “Wonder Woman” movie does not acknowledge this aspect of her character at all.</p><p>Yet, these movies widely marketed these subtle nods to the queer community as “gay characters,” “gay moments,” and “exclusively gay,” giving the impression that queer representation was a central aspect of these films. They primarily did this for three reasons: to pretend that they care about diverse representation, to be radical and groundbreaking, and to attract a large queer following.</p><p>The act of marketing a movie or TV show to appeal to the queer community without thoughtfully portraying queer characters is called “queerbaiting.” Queerbaiting has been a frequent practice in mainstream media for quite some time. It was coined on the internet by queer fanbases in the 2000s and has since evolved as the entertainment industry adapts to a rapidly changing political climate.</p><p>The term was first widely used to describe the subtextual relationships between two male characters in “Sherlock” and “Supernatural” and the similarly subtextual relationships that evolved in television shows like “Merlin,” “Once Upon a Time,” and “Rizzoli and Isles.”</p><p>These shows would acquire a queer following by purposefully portraying same-sex platonic relationships with slightly romantic undertones. Producers, directors, showrunners, and even actors would acknowledge the possibility of these relationships to keep fans on edge, but would never make them a reality.</p><p>While these television shows have had no problem enticing fans with subtextual same-sex relationships, they have been averse to explicitly portraying them because of the potential controversy and lowering in ratings. They use the queer community for optimal viewer numbers and ratings, treating them as a commodity.</p><p>However, the growing desire for legitimate, thoughtful representation has compelled many people to speak out against queerbaiting, warning fans not to fall for these tricks. With queer subtext yielding less and less success, producers turned to the next trick in the book—the “bury your gays” trope—introducing queer characters, effusively promoting them, and then quickly disposing of them.</p><p>The CW’s “The 100” advertised the relationship between two female characters masquerading as fervent advocates of the queer community in March 2016, and then abruptly and recklessly killed off one of these characters. The showrunner and writers were met with an overwhelmingly negative reaction from fans, and viewership plummeted. Since then, awareness of “bury your gays” and “lesbian death syndrome” have spread, and they have become less common—though not completely extinct—practices.</p><p>That brings us to where we are now. In a sociopolitical climate more tolerant of queer media representation than ever before, gay characters are able to exist without dying, but they still don’t have any real onscreen presence. Lesbian couples are two women briefly shown standing next to a stroller in “Finding Dory,” and if you look closely enough, you may see two men dancing in the background of the credits of “Beauty and the Beast.”</p><p>Positive representation of the queer community becomes more prevalent each year, with movies like “Moonlight” and “Carol” and TV shows like “The Bold Type,” “Shadowhunters,” and “Orange is the New Black,” but queerbaiting is far from a dying practice. To treat queer fanbases as disposable commodities is demoralizing and dehumanizing and perpetuates negative attitudes and opinions of the queer community.</p><p>I’m not going to be naïve and pretend that Hollywood cares more about making art than making a profit, but it wouldn’t hurt the film and television industries to tell a story that has not yet been told—the story of a queer person who is more than a one-dimensional character, the punchline of a joke, or a brief cameo. Better yet, tell the story of a trans person. Well-developed trans and nonbinary storylines are seldom present in mainstream media.</p><p>If stories don’t involve the LGBTQ+ community, they shouldn’t be advertised as such. Instead of letting queerbaiting continue to manifest in new ways, we should end it altogether.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2018-01-13 14:46:18.792723	19	1	A thinkpiece on a controversial practice in mainstream media and how it has evolved overtime.

Barry Lubin, Grandma’s creator, designed a unique and dynamic character whose trademark stunt was head-standing on whoopee cushions, a highly advanced acrobatic feat. The Big Apple Circus estimates that in his 25 seasons with the show, Grandma made more than nine million people laugh.</p><p>However, modern-day clowns do more than just entertain—they’re altruistic. Ronald McDonald, a character created in 1963, is known for his philanthropic work as the mascot of the Ronald McDonald Foundation.</p><p>While McDonald has enjoyed a reputation as a national icon, the majority of clowns have been viciously defamed in recent years. In an attempt to undermine a competing form of entertainment, Hollywood has appropriated clown-related imagery to scare viewers into a fear of circuses. The portrayal of clowns in Batman (1966) and Funhouse (1987) may have placed the nail in the coffin for American circuses, putting thousands of clowns out of work. In the recently released horror film, “It,” Pennywise the Dancing Clown terrorizes the children of a suburban town, taking the shape of their worst fears and biting off their limbs. Special effects, lighting, and makeup combine to make Pennywise terrifying: he has three rows of teeth, a bizarre Scottish accent, and a maniacal smile.</p><p>Clowns without scary makeup and special effects are oafish, non-threatening, and even lovable. They’re endearingly awkward, and their stylish wigs make a timeless fashion statement. Their trademark big feet make them prone to clumsiness; Pennywise isn’t an accurate representation of the broader clown community because he’s fast and agile, making him far more threatening than the average clown. The iconic big red nose produces squeaking noises, making interaction with clowns a multi-sensory experience.</p><p>While clowns may take on mischievous personas during performances, there is a distinct difference between rascal behavior and homicidal tendencies. Clowns have only ever wanted to bring joy to young children and adults. Their portrayal in the media as fearsome killers has contributed to an ailing clown industry and the fall of a once-beloved icon.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 05:31:52.142749	2	1	Clowns aren’t inherently scary.

96	﻿“It” Has a Point	it-has-a-point	<spec-reference id=102></spec-reference><p>I used to laugh at coulrophobics. The fear of Stephen King’s impish, sharp-toothed, demon of an entertainer in the movie “It,” which terrorized the children of Derry by transforming into their worst fears and systematically tearing off their limbs, seemed unfounded. After all, clowns are real, regular people. And clowns are not supposed to be scary.</p><p>But a survey conducted earlier this year by Vox Media and Morning Consult revealed that Americans are more afraid of clowns than terrorist attacks, a family member dying, the collapse of the economy, climate change, or dying themselves. Two out of three Americans want police or government intervention to investigate clown scares. The Ringling Brothers Circus, coined the “Greatest Show on Earth,” hosted its last performance this year. But somehow, a light-hearted entertainer, created to cater to children and the glittery aura of the circus, has come to strike more fear into the hearts of Americans than the Taliban.</p><p>Clowns can be traced back all the way to 2500 B.C., when Pygmy clowns catered to Egyptian pharaohs. Imperial China, Ancient Rome, and medieval Europe all saw their version of these unpredictable, hyperbolically happy comedians.</p><p>But this perpetually happy nature is easily conceived as something much more devious. Clowns must paint on their wide smiles every morning, fixing their grinning countenance whether or not they feel that way. And as humans who are inclined to judge a person’s character and trustworthiness based on their facial expressions and actions, the clown is shifty and untrustworthy, a plastic man. Their laughter is chilling because it seems out of place in a situation that doesn’t require laughter; Stephen King’s clown Pennywise is scary because he is hiding in a storm drain with a shining red balloon instead parading around the fairgrounds.</p><p>The fact that clowns are humans, and that they are very real, is another strike against them. Unlike ghosts or aliens, which are blatantly figures of the imagination without any scientific backing or solid evidence, clowns exist and blend in as unremarkable characters. The image of the corrupted clown, steered toward evil because of mistreatment or unresolved anger, can (and arguably does) happen every single day. An enemy that walks among you and has unsupervised access to your children is justifiably frightening.</p><p>This fear of clowns has also led to mass hysteria and “copycats” that harnessed fear in order to receive attention. Remember, for instance, John Wayne Gacy Jr., who raped, tortured, and killed at least thirty-three young men in Illinois between 1972 and 1978. He operated under the persona of Pogo the Clown, who had pointed tips for his mouth (instead of the standard, kid-friendly rounded tips), and was called the Killer Clown as he painted jarring self-portraits of himself as Pogo in prison before he was executed through lethal injection. The clown sightings in South Carolina last year, which included a group of teenagers luring children into the woods, are just another example of people taking advantage of this fear.</p><p>But know that the fact that many clown “sightings” are orchestrated pranks does not detract from the tangible fear that Americans have of clowns; on the contrary, it only serves to stand as an example of the self-realization of the unnerving nature of these wide-eyed, grinning entertainers.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 05:31:52.286223	2	1	Clowns are really freaking scary because they’re so human.
105	﻿From Disney to Twerking to “Younger Now”	from-disney-to-twerking-to-younger-now	<p>Over the past decade, Miley Cyrus has gone through drastic changes, from her innocent teenage “Hannah Montana” days to her controversial, wrecking ball-swinging “Bangerz” era. With her sixth studio album, “Younger Now,” released on September 29, 2017, Cyrus has returned to her country-pop roots in order to reveal a more mature and honest side of her.</p><p>The title track exemplifies Cyrus’s journey in search of her identity. Beginning with a simple country tune on the guitar and the lyrics, “Feels like I’ve just woke up / Like all this time I’ve been asleep / Even though it’s not who I am / I’m not afraid of who I used to be,” the autobiographical song describes how Cyrus’s past identities have helped shape herself and how she embraces her growth. It’s a much more raw self-reflection compared to some of her past songs, such as “Bang Me Box” from “Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz,” a song purely about lesbian sex, or “Do My Thang” from “Bangerz,” an admittedly catchy song in which Cyrus declares her nonchalance towards the public’s opinions on her.</p><p>Though not as powerful as some of Cyrus’s past songs like “The Climb,” “Malibu,” the album’s lead single, is a simple love song dedicated to Cyrus’s fiance, Liam Hemsworth. With just Cyrus’s breezy vocals accompanied by a mid-paced guitar melody, “Malibu” is an innocent, refreshing break from her bolder past of hip-hop and psychedelic songs. As she recalls her memories in Malibu with Hemsworth, her affection for him sounds clear and genuine.</p><p>Love is a powerful theme in Cyrus’s album. Possibly one of the album’s most emotional songs, “She’s Not Him,” depicts Cyrus’s love triangle. Accompanied by gentle strings, she displays her masterful lyricism, singing, “Even though we’ve gone to outer space / Still no way you can take his place.” In a high-pitched, yet soft voice, she regretfully laments that despite her infatuation with her female lover, speculated to be model Stella Maxwell, who Cyrus dated for a brief period of time, Maxwell could never match her true love, Hemsworth.</p><p>While much of the album is rooted in mellow beats and depicts an overall image of a more placid Cyrus, some of the defiant spunk from her more provocative days resurfaces throughout the album. She snarls, “And it’s time for this queen to go and find another throne / When I give it up, I give it all,” in the feisty break-up song “Love Somebody,” and, “It’s getting late, I’m starting to obsess / You got me crying and looking like a mess,” in the infectious rock-based “Thinkin’,” in which Cyrus displays her paranoia and obsession over a lover.</p><p>The album does have its weaker moments, such as “I Would Die For You,” a sweet, tender love ballad that disappoints with its somewhat cheesy and melodramatic lyrics. In addition, “Rainbowland,” a more uplifting, catchy tune featuring Cyrus’s godmother and icon Dolly Parton simply seems unmemorable in comparison to the other intimate tracks.</p><p>However, Cyrus has truly shown her versatility and surprised the public with a much more vulnerable side with “Younger Now.” Let’s just hope she doesn’t revert back to the nudity and sledgehammers.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:58:43.085116	16	1	Miley Cyrus’ “Younger Now” is possibly her most recent genuine work to date.
106	﻿The Life of Kylie is Killing Reality TV	the-life-of-kylie-is-killing-reality-tv	<p>Though reality TV has gained a reputation as “trash TV” over the years, many fail to realize that classic shows like “Survivor” and “America’s Got Talent” are also classified as reality TV. Reality TV is an art form in its own right. The idea is to portray real emotions from relatable and lively individuals in an artificial setting, while following a storyline that is fictional enough to be fascinating but real enough to seem genuine. Creating a successful reality TV show requires almost as much, if not more, thought than a fictional TV show, which has the crutch of being fictional. Reality TV is burdened with the task of portraying a reality that isn’t real without being discernibly fake for the entertainment of viewers in a world where there is so much competition for viewers’ attention.</p><p>After appearing on “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” for 10 years, Kylie Jenner is reality TV royalty. It wasn't a surprise when she came forth with her own show, “The Life of Kylie.” Kylie’s aim in starring on this show was to show the other side of her and to differentiate herself from other social media influencers and reality TV stars.</p><p>The content of the show alternates between more structured interviews of Kylie where she is facing the camera and being asked questions such as “Do you want kids?”—to which she duly responds “I do”—and more typical reality TV scenes with her lounging around and hanging out with friends. The transitions between scenes are filled with pictures from Kylie’s social media feeds, including lots of bikini photos. These bright poolside photos with Kylie beaming and laughing with friends feel out of place when juxtaposed with the sober tone of her interviews. Including these visuals also cheapens the production quality of the show because it feels like a 30-minute Snapchat with better camera quality rather than a professional reality show.</p><p>Reality TV thrives on the audience being involved, whether it is allowing the audience to call in and vote for contestants like on “American Idol” or the presence of conflict and petty drama that viewers can become immersed in.</p><p>However, because of a lack of any real conflict, the show is drawn out. Kylie and I were both bored most of the time. To increase viewership, “The Life of Kylie” is planning to add cameos from Kim Kardashian West, subsequently relying on the Kardashian family instead of Kylie standing on her own. The Kardashian family has made an empire out of its reality TV show, so Kylie was trained by the best, yet her show still falls short.</p><p>As stated before, the storyline is barely present. Most of the first two episodes are centered around Kylie surprising a boy named Albert as his date for prom. Kylie says missing her own prom made her "really sad” and unfollowed her friends because she "just couldn’t stand to see" the pictures from prom.</p><p>Kylie introduces a number of characters she calls friends, who the audience does not care about at all. The most interesting thing about most of them is their names. For example, her hair stylist, Tokyo, is good at styling hair. The fact that her “closest” friends are her employees and the absence of any truly dynamic characters makes for a drab cast.</p><p>Kylie also doesn’t play her usual role of reality TV diva when left to her own devices. Her expressions are blank and disinterested for most of the show, contrasting sharply with her jubilant Instagram videos in the transitions.</p><p>While she does attempt to open up, Kylie’s revelations on the show are neither distinctive nor unexpected. When discussing Kylie, W magazine wrote, “How much can you really learn about a person through 12,000+ tweets, 5,000+ Instagram posts, and the most-viewed Snapchat story in the world?” The answer is just about everything. For example, Kylie reveals makeup is her only passion and that she hadn't realized it until she launched her multi-million dollar makeup line. She attempts to garner pity with lines like “I can’t relate to a lot of people. I do feel like an outcast,” but it doesn't feel genuine and it’s hard to feel bad for the girl who has it all.</p><p>Despite the show’s numerous flaws, there are actual lessons that can be learned from it. It becomes glaringly obvious between the transitions filled with Kylie posing in her bikini beaming, and the actual content of the episode, that real life and social media are vastly different, even for someone as affluent and popular as Kylie.</p><p>In producing “The Life of Kylie,” Kylie and her team grossly underestimated the fact that reality TV is an art form in its own right. All the major elements of a good story or TV show also apply to reality TV shows, but they were all neglected. Turning on a camera and posing is for Snapchat and does not belong on TV. Just being Kylie Jenner may get her headlines at the blink of an eye, but it won't get her show good ratings.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:59:21.918161	17	1	A review of The Life of Kylie

Lynch established that the small screen was an equivalent art medium to the big screen, an absurd notion at the time due to the perception of television shows as senseless distractions for bored housewives.</p><p>Though the series only aired for two seasons after its debut in 1990, it quickly gained a massive cult following, partially because it left so many questions unanswered that viewers began theorizing about hidden messages and motives. However, as any Lynch fan knows, trying to explain the workings of his unique imagination is futile. It is better to simply enjoy its eccentricity and become immersed in Lynch’s surreal, phantasmagoric style.</p><p>The show returned for a long-overdue final season 25 years later this May and was just as impactful the second time around. Despite the changes made from the old “Twin Peaks” to the recent installment, the show has remained true to its origins in terms of its legacy and what it represents.</p><p>Inspired by the film noir of the mid-20th century, Lynch established himself as a pioneer in the world of filmmaking with cult-classic movies such as “Eraserhead” (1977), “The Elephant Man” (1980), and “Blue Velvet” (1986). He gained a reputation for directing chilling, unconventional, and offbeat movies characterized by dreamlike visuals and sporadic use of eerie sound effects. In “Eraserhead,” Lynch depicts a deformed, alien-like infant who makes a distorted mewling noise that sounds terribly similar to a crying baby, yet contains a level of artificiality. There is never a silent moment in his films; a humming or buzzing background noise produces the perpetual feeling of discomfort that is vital to the Lynchian ambience.</p><p>Lynch’s decision to turn to television and create “Twin Peaks” with Mark Frost set a precedent for other legendary filmmakers, like Martin Scorsese, to do the same. His willingness to enter the humble world of TV after several big screen successes conveyed that television could be just as prestigious and artistic as cinema.</p><p>At first glance, “Twin Peaks” is a typical small-town murder mystery in which a beautiful teenage girl dies, and the police begin an investigation to discover the identity of her killer. However, Twin Peaks is no ordinary town. A dark shadow looms over it, and it’s not just from the prostitution rings and drug cartels.</p><p>An evil entity known as Bob has escaped from a part of the spirit world called the Black Lodge to wreak havoc on its residents, who are no strangers to supernatural forces themselves: one character’s soul becomes trapped in a doorknob, and another’s wooden log gives her accurate premonitions of the future. Bob is a physical manifestation of humanity’s darkest dreams and desires, a theme that is prevalent throughout Lynch’s work.</p><p>The characters in the show act in chilling mannerisms that imply a sense of otherworldliness. Even Agent Dale Cooper, protagonist and fan-favorite FBI agent, is a robotic and emotionally void character who is so socially inept that he talks to an invisible “Diane” through a recording device.</p><p>Once, when Cooper is shot and wounded in his hotel room, room service comes in with a glass of milk and oddly neglects the obvious fact that he is bleeding out and dying. This classic Lynchian scene is drawn out in virtual silence between the two characters as the bellhop proceeds to give him his bill and a thumbs-up. Cooper doesn’t seem bothered by his peculiar behavior, nor is he particularly concerned for his own safety.</p><p>From its freakish characters to Cooper’s iconic line “Damn good coffee,” the series has attained a classic status in the entertainment industry, which has made its 2017 return all the more anticipated.</p><p>During the show’s 25-year hiatus, the world changed in a myriad of ways, with the most profound change being technology. Lynch’s style also evolved with time, slowly incorporating the theme of the digital age into his work. There are moments in each episode of the return in which the camera whirs and shakes for a split second. The special effects and CGI in the show are substandard as well. This is a deliberate effort by Lynch to amplify the artificiality and otherworldliness of the world of “Twin Peaks.”</p><p>We are used to seeing science fiction and fantasy TV shows with realistic CGI, and by rejecting this norm, Lynch draws attention to the surrealism of his creation. He was able to keep the original ideas behind “Twin Peaks” intact, but he also accounted for the modernization that occurred in television technology. Lynch’s ability to capture both sides of the spectrum is a testament to his directorial expertise.</p><p>The essence of “Twin Peaks” is not in the individual characters and plot of the show, as is the case for most shows, but in its abstract peculiarity and uniqueness that have been preserved for a quarter-century. Without David Lynch’s masterpiece, shows like “American Horror Story” (2011-present), “Bates Motel” (2013-2017), and “The X-Files” (1993-present) would never have been created.</p><p>His creative genius was ahead of its time and paved the way for the onset of the golden age of American television. “Twin Peaks” is not just a series; it is a concept, an experience, and a dream. Though the show itself seems to be at a definitive end, its legacy will live on for a very long time.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 06:59:52.234535	17	1	“Twin Peaks” is not just a series; it is a concept, an experience, and a dream.
115	﻿Football’s CTE Crisis	football-s-cte-crisis	<p>February 5, 2012. Super Bowl XLVI. Third quarter. Tom Brady, New England Patriots’ star quarterback, drops back to pass, scanning the field before firing a tight spiral to his 6’1”, 245-pound tight end Aaron Hernandez. He catches it at the seven yard line and muscles his way into the end zone to increase his team’s lead to 17-9. He dances in the end zone, raising his arms to the roaring crowd. Even though the Patriots ended up losing the game, Hernandez goes for eight catches and 67 yards and inks a five-year, $40 million extension with the Patriots that offseason.</p><p>Five years later, Aaron Hernandez was found hanging from his bedsheets in Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, MA. He was two years into a life sentence without parole for the first degree murder of Odin Lloyd. To the world, he is a cautionary tale—one of a young player who let fame get to his head and killed someone in cold blood over a trivial issue. Besides the murder of Lloyd, Hernandez was also accused, but acquitted, in the murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. All of this paints a bleak picture of Hernandez, and while he was not a good person, there is more to this case than meets the eye.</p><p>Yes, Hernandez murdered in cold blood. Yes, he deserved life in prison for the atrocities he committed. However, it recently has come to light that Hernandez was suffering from Stage 3 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This is the most severe case ever seen in a person at such a young age.</p><p>Because of this, the Hernandez family is suing the Patriots and the league, citing that they knew the risks for Hernandez but still kept them from him. The case will no doubt remain in the legal system for the foreseeable future, but besides Hernandez, there have been and will be many others with a CTE diagnosis.</p><p>Posing a major threat to the National Football League (NFL), this CTE problem needs to be addressed and corralled before it brings the NFL down. A complete reform of the sport is neither needed nor wanted, but more studies about what specifically causes CTE, along with more player awareness programs and increased neurological checks, would go a long way to quench players’ fears and potentially save the sport.</p><p>CTE is a degenerative brain disorder that is characterized by a buildup of the Tau protein, which slowly kills brain cells. It takes thousands of hits and enough of them, concussive or otherwise, to cause CTE. This makes football players especially susceptible: going head to head with 300-pound linebackers every week, five months out of the year unsurprisingly takes its toll on the brain.</p><p>However, one of the main reasons this remains an issue is that it can only be diagnosed post-mortem. Symptoms such as memory loss, social impairment, and eventually dementia or depression can often be a symptom, but nothing definitive can be done prior to death.</p><p>For a while, the NFL avoided this issue. It wouldn’t bring it up or admit that there is a link between football and degenerative brain issues. Even after players such as Junior Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowler, committed suicide in 2012, or Lou Creekmur, eight-time Pro Bowler, had autopsies that proved he had CTE, the NFL didn’t budge, stating that it would wait on more concrete studies.</p><p>The league went as far as to dismiss findings that the Golden-Globe nominated movie “Concussion” (2015) portrayed. It reflects on the work of Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian pathologist who found that former NFL player Mike Webster’s brain was severely damaged. He went on to conduct studies on other NFL players and found similar results. When he attempted to present his findings to Commissioner Roger Goodell, the league refused to even listen to him. However, after numerous cases and a 2017 study from the Journal of the American Medical Association that found 110 of the 111 former players’ brains studied had CTE, the NFL was forced to change its tune.</p><p>To keep players’ families from suing the NFL, it reached a $1 billion plus concussion settlement in 2013 that pays out upwards of $5 million to each family for a variety of injuries post-football. A CTE-related death is worth $4 million under the current agreement.</p><p>However, even after this influx of data on CTE was introduced, the NFL did nothing to restructure the settlement and increase the payout. Financial compensation to players’ families can only come after years of which suffering players and their loved ones had to cope with the disease. Pain should be worth more than $4 million.</p><p>Another issue for the NFL is the growing number of current players that are retiring before the age of 35 to preserve their mental capacities to live longer and healthier lives. Chris Borland (age 24), A.J. Tarpley (Age 23), and D’Brickashaw Ferguson (age 32) all hung up the cleats before they were forced out, citing heightened awareness of the risks posed in the NFL as factors. If more well-known players continue to retire at young ages, the NFL may lose billions in revenue.</p><p>These new, high profile dropouts have pushed the NFL to change rules to limit high-impact collisions, most-notably being the move of touchbacks from the 20-yard line to 25. This makes teams less likely to return kickoffs and collide with each other after gaining 50 feet or more of momentum, thereby limiting some of the more brutal head-on hits in the sport. This rule change, among others, is a start for the NFL. While it is impossible to eradicate head injuries in such a high-contact sport, the league can take steps like this to limit the most direct hits.</p><p>The Hernandez case is the most sensational one yet. He was one of the most recent players to have been in the league, so his play is still fresh in people's minds. However, as more studies come out proving other players’ brain issues, and I’m positive they will, the fans will begin to turn on the NFL as their childhood stars slowly go out both mentally and physically.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, the NFL needs to get in front of the issue by openly discussing it and funding research to prevent such severe damage.</p><p>I’m not advocating for a complete overhaul of the NFL. Much like millions of other Americans, my Sundays are spent switching from game to game and checking my fantasy lineups. To change the basic rules of the sport would be a travesty. However, this CTE issue is not going away, and more steps need to be taken to limit its place in football. Studies that attempt to decipher which types of hits lead to a higher CTE risk and compare the general population’s risk of CTE to that of a football player’s will go a long way in minimizing this problem.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:43:36.770619	6	1	In light of the Aaron Hernandez’s CTE reports, CTE is taking even more of a forefront in the NFL.Outquotes:  Going head to head with 300-pound linebackers every week, five months out of the year unsurprisingly takes its toll on the brain.
119	﻿Boys’ Fencing Remain Undefeated	boys-fencing-remain-undefeated	<p>Senior and co-captain of the boys’ fencing team, Max Chan, faced off against one of Long Island City’s top fencers. Chan evaded his opponent’s attacks while landing multiple back flicks, which involved bending the blade to touch the opponent. The team prevailed with a 90-30 victory.</p><p>Currently gunning for the 16th straight undefeated season, each Stuyvesant fencer has recorded five touches and allowed only two Long Island City fencers to reach five, limiting most to one to two touches. Stuyvesant sits at the top of its division after winning the first four games of the season. “We’ve fenced a few games so far and have been winning by huge margins, like 90-15, 90-18, etc,” Chan said. An opponent has yet to come within 50 points of Stuyvesant, another testament to the team’s dominance.</p><p>These victories are not unexpected to the members of the team. “Our practices are some of the most rigorous you'll find, both mentally and physically. Fencing really is a combination of both physical and mental dexterity. That's why it's sometimes referred to as ‘Physical Chess,’” Chan said. Practices are where teams gain the mindset and technique to compete in games, and their practices have been guiding the team to this undefeated season.</p><p>Coach Joel Winston’s mentoring attitude for the members of his team have helped them all flourish this season. “He helps us a lot with improving our fencing, but apart from that, he’s also very encouraging and helps us grow closer as a team,” senior and co-captain Jerome Freudenberg said.</p><p>Beside the Stuyvesant practices, another key reason for this high level of play is the amount of time the starters are putting into the sport. “A lot of our fencers fence outside of school during the off-season so we have a considerable advantage. We have a more dedicated team than most others,” Freudenberg said. These include all six starters: Chan, Freudenberg, senior and co-captain Thompson Hui, seniors Eric Zhang and Benny He, and sophomore Tazman Libson. These six have a combined 47-2 record so far this year. By fencing outside of Stuyvesant, the players compete more often than other players on opposing teams. “Normally, schools have just one or two good fencers who fence at club and who carry the whole team, but this year we have a whole starting lineup of them,” Chan said.</p><p>At 4-0 and coming off 15 undefeated regular seasons, the fencing team has high hopes for the rest of its season. Led by a strong senior class, an undefeated record is definitely a possibility for the team. Even beyond the regular season, the team definitely has the ability to go deep into the playoffs and possibly win a championship. “Of course, everything just comes down to that one day,” Chan said. “But I trust my team, my co-captains, and I am confident we can succeed at playoffs this year.”</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:44:09.173642	24	1	
103	﻿Coulrophobia Be Damned	coulrophobia-be-damned	<p>“Do you need to be a virgin to see this [expletive deleted] clown?!” is one of many wisecracks in the highly anticipated film remake of Stephen King’s chilling novel. Directed by Andy Muschietti, “It” is an adaptation of the first chapter of King’s book of the same name, which follows a gang of ‘80s kids from the small town of Derry, Maine, as they hunt for a mysterious, terrifying, soul-eating creature that has been kidnapping children. The film is innovative in its ability to combine just the right amount of jump scares with a dose of pubescent humor, along with a curious exploitation of fear. Nobody is safe from Pennywise, the immortal, blood-curdling, psychopathic jester. “It” contains all the qualities of a standard horror film interspersed with classic elements of ‘80s nostalgia.</p><p>Pennywise, played by Bill Skarsgård, emerges every 27 years to terrorize children and feeds on their fear by wolfing down their souls. The focus of the film is Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher), a shy, stuttering boy on a quest to find his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), who is kidnapped by the murderous clown. Bill blames himself and enlists his misfit friends, Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), and Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer). On their journey, they meet Beverly (Sophia Lillis), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), and Mike (Chosen Jacobs), and are deemed the “Losers’ Club” by the neighborhood bullies. The group confronts Pennywise several times and discovers his horrifying shapeshifting abilities. Along with his ability to rotate his body parts in a very unhuman-like way, the clown’s head constantly morphs into that of each child’s nightmare. The clown transforms into a misshapen woman from a painting Stanley walks past in fear at the synagogue and, similarly, becomes a leper to terrorize hypochondriac Eddie on his way home.</p><p>The movie seamlessly integrates its characters’ fears into the storyline and gives each character a purpose. Some of the characters’ fears are so subtly presented that they aren’t noticeable until Pennywise embraces those fears and exploits them. Oftentimes, the most candid or tranquil moments were the ones that gave each character more backstory, such as when Mike refuses to kill lambs at his family’s farm. It doesn’t seem important at first, but the scene later becomes evidence of Mike’s fear of death and slaughter. Beverly stands out as the gutsy lone girl in the group and exudes an aura of self-confidence, but is haunted by her period and her abusive father. Eddie constantly rattles off his worries about contamination at a breakneck pace, while Richie continually digresses from the topic at hand with wisecracks and innuendos.</p><p>Of course, the ever-present villain in the film is the killer clown and its appearances throughout the plot instill terror in both the gang and the audience. Cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung’s mastery of the camera is effective in making Pennywise’s screen time terrifying. Chung sweeps from frame to frame with angles that emphasize the film’s contrasting themes of terror and mellowness, including one particularly terrifying fish-eyed close-up of Pennywise getting ready to bite Eddie’s head off. Chung succeeds in making Pennywise’s appearances so random and wholly unexpected that the audience members are left falling off of their chairs in dread of the clown’s next arrival. There were many times when I  covered my eyes in panic, as if that could protect me.</p><p>Keeping time with Chung is composer Benjamin Wallfish’s rich orchestral melodies and sinister nursery rhymes that punctuate the more frightening aspects of the film but also highlight moments of fun and resolution. Morbid tunes play as Ben flips through a book about Old Derry’s dark past, finally crescendoing into a fast-paced and urgent refrain that follows Ben as he runs from a headless victim of Pennywise’s attacks. The sharp jump in the music as the corpse appeared caused the entire crowd in the theatre to suck in its breath. The orchestra swells as the movie finally fades out to show the group of children reflecting on their assault of Pennywise later in the film.</p><p>In addition to the film’s ability to scare viewers, “It” also breaks standard horror film expectations. Instead of back-to-back jump scares, the movie utilizes its characters’ young ages to bring a nostalgic humor from the days when bad puberty jokes were common. Despite the dangers Pennywise poses, the kids still enjoy their summer fun and even find time for a wild rock battle with the neighborhood bully, accompanied with appropriate heavy metal music. The film even goes so far as to be meta, like when Richie is wowed by Bill not stuttering once during an impromptu speech. Though Richie’s sex jokes are sometimes a bit much, the movie tries to be unconventional by mixing the scary and the funny.</p><p>While “It” may not be the scariest movie out there, it is definitely capable of making audiences both laugh and cover their eyes in terror. The film balances themes of friendship and loyalty with recurring gore and suspense, creating a product that is as thrilling as anticipated, but also lets viewers root for the protagonists as they embark on their heroic journey. As most of us know, fear can’t be overcome overnight, so we hope to see more from the “Losers’ Club” in the future.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 00:01:12.33511	4	1	“It” brings the traditional exploitation of fear to the table along with some unexpected humor and soul.

On what would most likely be the spookiest day of the year, ghouls, zombies, and scariest of all, Former Assistant Principal of Family Affairs and Student Engagement and Current Assistant Principal of Safety, Security, Student Affairs, Health, and Physical Education Brian Moran roamed the streets of Tribeca.</p><p>However, despite the particularly frightening transformation of Stuyvesant High School’s student body, one group was distinctly normal. After a long week of desperate procrastination and sleepless nights full of League of Legends, the seniors were suffering from symptoms of first stage senioritis. Unfortunately, their horrors had just begun; they had less than 24 hours to complete their college applications or else they would die.</p><p>After receiving his daily fix of caffeine from the breakfast cart, senior Anthony Guan blinked, confused by the mob of supernatural creatures and cats in front of him. “Oh no, I knew I should have kept going to church,” Guan whispered, his face white as he stared into the back of the Devil. “Hold up, I need some more coffee,” he decided. The stimulatory drug, however, did little to clear Guan’s fears of the sudden invasion by supernatural creatures, which, unbeknownst to him, were being repeated in the minds of every senior heading to school that morning.</p><p>Seniors all around the school had forgotten about Halloween after being so swamped with work, and were consequently frightened for their lives. “I walked into AP Gov an-and Ms. Siegel had turned into Bloody Mary! She grinned at me with bloodstained teeth and I was out of that room immediately,” a senior cried hysterically. “I tried to see my guidance counselor, but she had become an incarnation of Satan too!” The entire day was filled with screams and shouts of terror as seniors seeked refuge from the deadly monsters now plaguing the school. Because all their teachers had been replaced with monsters, they took the situation as a valid excuse to cut.</p><p>“I wonder where the real Polazzo went,” voiced a worried senior. “That beardless man must’ve kidnapped him and took his place!”</p><p>The security guards tried to instill order, but had, for the first year ever, decided to forgo their traditional uniforms to do a group vampire costume. Every time they chased down a senior, trying to bring them back to class, they were sprayed with garlic cloves and fountain water, and thrust upon with crosses, all generously donated by the Stuyvesant Anti-Vampire Club. Senior Adam Abbas converted a NERF gun that he bravely confiscated from Moran into a pencil stake shooter, but never used it since he had barricaded himself in the Robotics room anyway.</p><p>The underclassmen, though confused, took advantage of the situation by frightening seniors to the point of utter terror, only releasing them after extracting confidential school secrets, such as the location of the 11th floor pool. The administration, however, was not happy with the occurrence. Principal Eric Contreras, dressed as the “It” clown, expressed his frustration: “I thought clowns were supposed to be funny, so why is everyone running away from me?” The attendance office was especially annoyed after receiving 800 class excuse notices the following morning, citing “a demonic invasion of the supernatural.”</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 00:16:48.770889	23	1	Seniors forget about Halloween and believe their school has become haunted.

After complaining for a solid 17 minutes, during which any onlooker would have immediately suggested that AP Whining was the perfect class for Lobel, he ran to his computer and began to type out a request for help in the form of a Facebook post. “I have a 97.785 science average, a 98 overall average, a 96 English average, I got all A’s in third grade, and my mommy says I’m her ‘widdle smartie pants’; why didn’t I get into AP Whining?” read the post in the “Dear Incoming Class of 2018…We Have Advice but Only at Useless Times and Not When You Actually Need It” Facebook group.</p><p>To Max’s surprise, instead of helpful comments, his post received hundreds of angery reaccs and responses. “I didn’t understand why people were attacking me. I didn’t do anything wrong. It’s not like I tried to create a StuyJoust event or anything,” Lobel said.</p><p>These angry responses, which ranged from “Whom’st’ve’d’th man’s,” to “Welcome to your tape,” sparked a series of Facebook posts from different Stuyvesant students attacking Lobel, supporting Lobel, attacking the Lobel supporters, supporting the Lobel attackers, attacking the Lobel attacker’s attackers, and asking for people to stop posting by making their own unnecessary posts.</p><p>Somehow surprised by the reaction to his post, Lobel tried to defend his decision to share his exact grades. “Why would I make this post to brag? So what if I have a 99.39397 in math, a 97.666 in history, and a 100 in physics? This post was definitely NOT an attempt for me to make up for my lack of social skills by getting people to like me for my 99 average!” said Lobel, while also “accidentally” changing his profile picture to a screenshot of his average with the caption, “Oops, wrong photo!”</p><p>In the end, the program office saw Lobel’s Facebook posts and his extraordinary talent to complain, which fulfills all pre-reqs, and accepted him into his dream class of AP Whining.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:40:35.129079	5	1	A Stuy student is genuinely surprised when people attack him for posting his exact grades on facebook.
111	﻿Administration Creates “No Dap Zones”	administration-creates-no-dap-zones	<p>This past weekend, a new policy banning “daps” in select areas of Stuyvesant has been put in place. The policy, effective immediately, will be strictly enforced through the use of a special student-led task force assembled by the Student Leadership Team (SLT) at this past month's meeting. Any violators will be put in the new pillory in front of the senior bar, subject to the taunting daps of passersby.</p><p>The ban, which applies to the half floor, library, and anywhere within four feet of senior and Spectator editor Shameek Rakshit, seeks to decrease the toxic behavior within the confines of the building. “I cannot condone the excessive amounts of friendliness going around in Stuyvesant’s halls,” nurse Danielle Karunadasa said.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, a dap “is a friendly gesture of greeting, agreement, or solidarity between two people,” with origins in the 1960s as a part of the Black Power movement.

We never gave up and really came together as a unit.” —Perry Wang, senior and captain</p><p>When a team starts a season with four consecutive losses, optimism can be hard to come by. However, for senior running back and captain of the Stuyvesant Peglegs varsity football team Perry Wang, there was still an upside to the team’s 55-12 loss to Bayside High School.</p><p>Though the Peglegs struggled, Wang is sure that they remained mentally tough. “The whole Bayside game gave us some optimism for our Beach Channel game. We never gave up and really came together as a unit,” he said.</p><p>As improbable as this may seem, considering that the blowout loss dropped the Peglegs to a 0-4 start for a second consecutive season, the team’s performance actually reflected Wang’s sentiment: They improved as the game progressed.</p><p>After being outscored 35-0 in the first half—the third time this season that the Peglegs have been shut out in the first two quarters—the team fought back, adding two passing touchdowns and holding Bayside scoreless in the third quarter.</p><p>Furthermore, the Peglegs stayed true to their strength, which, according to Wang, is their passing game. Aside from an interception, senior quarterback Rigneyla Rigneyla was spectacular, completing 10 of 13 passes for two touchdowns as Stuyvesant outgained Bayside in the passing game with 175 yards to Bayside’s 102.</p><p>With the following week’s opponent, Beach Channel Educational Campus, having posted a high of just 63 yards through the first four games, Rigneyla’s aerial prowess had the potential to pose a serious advantage. This game, on October 8, resulted in another Peglegs loss, but proved that Wang’s confidence was not unfounded. They only lost by 10 points, the narrowest of any game thus far this season.</p><p>They have also showed a significant defensive improvement. After giving up 127 total points over the previous three weeks, the Peglegs held Beach Channel to just 16 and shut them out through three of the four quarters. This is especially impressive considering that Rigneyla threw two interceptions in this game, meaning that Beach Channel started their drives with good field position on multiple occasions.</p><p>Of course, the Peglegs had their fair share of struggles, too. For one, Rigneyla was not as sharp as he had normally been. Completing just seven of 25 passes for just 75 yards, a touchdown, and the two interceptions, it marked the first time this season that Rigneyla turned the ball over twice and also failed to complete even half of his passes.</p><p>Additionally, Rigneyla’s completion percentage in this game (28 percent) was his lowest of the first five games. This is not to put all the blame on the quarterback, though: the Peglegs came up short in many other areas. For example, though Stuyvesant contained Beach Channel’s passing game well, giving up just four completions for 38 yards, the Peglegs were not nearly as dominant against the run. Both of the touchdowns that Beach Channel scored came on the ground, and the Peglegs gave up over 100 rushing yards for the fifth consecutive game.</p><p>This speaks to their lack of size in the defensive line, something that Wang described as being one of Stuyvesant’s weaknesses before the season. “We might not physically match up against every team,” he said.</p><p>This is not to say that Peglegs have regressed defensively. In fact, many of the team’s defensive newcomers—namely Joshel Xiedeng, Ian Sulley, and Daniel Chernov—are playing well. Against Beach Channel, these three defensive linemen combined for a total of 10 tackles, two tackles for a loss, and a sack, with Wang himself also adding a sack of his own from the linebacker position.</p><p>However, it just isn’t enough against teams with larger offensive linemen. This was the case last season too when the Peglegs gave up 196 rushing yards to a more sizeable George Washington team en route to a 36-20 loss, and it was likely also the case against Beach Channel.</p><p>The Peglegs’ most recent game, however—aptly played on Friday, October 13—featured far fewer potential positive takeaways from a glance. In a 54-14 loss to Eagle Academy, Stuyvesant’s play was diametrically opposed to what one would have expected after the stout defensive performance against Beach Channel.</p><p>Though the Peglegs again demonstrated an ability to finish strong, scoring the entirety of their 14 points in the second half, it was a dismal game overall, particularly on defense. They were dominated in the run game, giving up 358 rushing yards, including 235 on 13 carries by Eagle Academy’s Gary Newman. On top of that, the Peglegs gave up their highest passing total of the season, 85 yards.</p><p>There does not seem to be just one thing for the Peglegs to do in order to turn their season around. Rather, it will take improvements in all facets of their game for them to get a win in their remaining games. However, in a division as difficult as theirs, if they keep the positive attitude Wang and others have shown thus far, the future looks good for the team.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:43:47.198148	24	1	After a 0-6 start, the Stuyvesant Peglegs have tough matchups ahead in the team’s final three games.

The team needed to win two of the last three games to make the playoffs and did so.The team also beat its rival, Lab Museum United, 4-3 in overtime two days prior to the LaGuardia game.</p><p>The win against Lab Museum United was not only crucial for the playoffs, but was also payback because the Mimbas had lost to them 3-2 in overtime earlier this season. The second game did not start well for them, falling behind 3-1 early. However, once the second half started, they quickly scored two goals, tying the game. When they entered overtime, Lab Museum United picked up the physicality, and in the last 30 seconds, the refs called a direct free kick, which sophomore Selene Kaehny drilled into the goal. “When my shot went right over the keeper's head I was in shock. [I’m] not going to lie: I started crying a little bit because the entire team ran over to me and started hugging and screaming,” she said.</p><p>The wins against Lab Museum United and LaGuardia High School showcased the Mimbas strength of the underclassmen on the team, since they scored seven of the eight goals during this two game stretch. Kaehny scored three, sophomore Eve Wening scored two, and freshman Aki Yamaguchi scored two. Furthermore, sophomore goalie Emory Walsh has stepped up and been a tremendous player for the team, saving 26 shots over the past two games.</p><p>The Mimbas had many cancelled games due to weather, and they used that time wisely. “We stayed really focused during the time that we had off and just kept practicing really hard,” senior and co-captain Saloni Majmudar said. They also used this time to bond and become more close-knit than before. “We use this time not only to become better soccer players, but [to become] better teammates because individuals don’t win games, teams do,” senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl said.</p><p>The Mimbas are excited and ready for the playoffs, and they could not be coming at a better time. Since September 19, the team has gone 5-1 and hopes to continue the hot streak into the playoffs. Last year, the team finished with a similar record and lost in the first round in the playoffs, but the team believes it can go further than it has before. “[In] the past two games, our skill level as a team has just skyrocketed.

113	﻿The Vixen Vex in First Home Game	the-vixen-vex-in-first-home-game	<p>The atmosphere of the crowded third floor gym surged as junior Alexandra Archer approached for a middle hit. She slammed the ball down mercilessly, refusing to ease up despite the otherwise relaxed game between Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity volleyball team and Bard High School of Early College’s volleyball team. The other players had a similar mindset, making few, if any, errors throughout the game and taking advantage of every free ball over and every opportunity for a hit or a bump.</p><p>“There wasn’t too much I could evaluate them on, other than maybe serving and a few free passes, which they did well,” coach Vasken Choubaralian said. Indeed, key players like senior, co-captain, and outside hitter Ziqi Guo, senior and opposite hitter Zilin Guo, and senior, co-captain, and libero Kristina Kim had serving streaks of nine, seven, and seven, respectively. The scores were devastating for the other team, with the Vixens dominating 25-6 and 25-10.</p><p>The team this year is mostly unchanged because most of the starting players last year are seniors this year. However, a notable exception is freshman and middle hitter Anaïs Delfau, whose sister was last year’s captain Chloe Delfau.</p><p>Both Ziqi Guo and Choubaralian believe that the team’s chemistry this year is stronger. “The traditional view of a varsity team is that the seniors or juniors get to start because of experience. However, our starting freshman has the same, if not more, experience than some of the current juniors or seniors. In the end, coach tries to put the best lineup out there regardless of your grade,” Ziqi Guo said. Coach Chourbaralian and Assistant Coach Pan have demonstrated this mentality in their experimentation and flexibility with the lineup, allowing many of the more inexperienced players to come in as substitutes when the Vixens had a strong lead.</p><p>A straight two-set win for the Vixens’ first home game speaks to a promising season for them, and if last year was anything of an indication, they’re a strong prospect for playoffs, as well as the top teamof the Manhattan A League.</p><p>However, in the past, once the Vixens defeated schools in Manhattan in the playoffs, they struggled and had to end their season disappointingly early. Ziqi hopes that additional scrimmages, the heightened team bond, and the practice in improving passing will remedy this issue. “I see a lot of potential in our team, and as long as we play together like a team, we will be able to play our best every game,” she said.</p><p>“[Being PSAL Champions] will probably be a distant goal of mine. A more realistic goal would be semifinals, at least,” Choubaralian said. “We still need to work on backrow passing, service reception, and improving my setter a little bit. [With that], I think we’ll be quite unstoppable.”</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-27 01:00:11.42076	24	1	The Vixens have previously had a very successful run in their Manhattan A Division in the past, and lived up to their expectations in the first home game of their season against Bard High School of Early College.

Guo slammed the ball down, ending the first set decisively in favor of the Vixens. Similarly, the team dominated the second set, winning 25-16.</p><p>With their first playoff game against 31st seed Bayard Rustin Educational Complex in the books after just two sets, it seemed like the Vixens were well on their way to a successful post-season, but a closer look indicated otherwise. Missed covers and receives and countless net balls riddled the game, and for a second seed team, this was beyond disappointing. Too often, a server from Bayard would cost the Vixens more than a few points before they were able to return the serve. “We definitely didn’t meet our standards for how we should have played. Instead of playing like a two seed, we stooped down to the other team’s level,” junior Alexandra Archer said.</p><p>Playing down is difficult to address because it has more to do with the mental and emotional states of the players than their physical capabilities. However, the Vixens didn’t give up and tried to soothe their nerves. “We’ve made some new cheers that help us laugh a little and move past any mistake,” Archer said. “We need to focus all the extra energy our body is giving us into the game.”</p><p>Despite their best efforts, however, the momentum the Vixens had gained during the season didn’t transfer into the playoffs. The game against Bayard foreshadowed the subsequent loss that would end the Vixens’ shot at advancing in playoffs. In a disappointing turn of events, the Vixens lost two sets to one against the 15th seed Florence LaGuardia High School Athletics in the second-round playoff game. “I don’t want them to feel like it’s their fault. I admire the effort they put into this season and into the game,” coach Vasken Choubaralian said.</p><p>The Vixens had entered the A division playoffs as an impressive second seed in a pool of 31 teams, and though they didn’t advance as far as they’d hoped, it was a season to be proud of. With the exception of a tough outing away against a formidable Seward Park Campus, the team had a successful regular season, winning every other match, including its rematch against Seward Park, most in just two sets. They finished atop the Manhattan A South/East division with an 11-1 record. Seward Park and Lab Museum United finished close behind with 10-2 and 9-3 records, respectively.</p><p>In addition to their success as a team, many of the starters were forces to be reckoned with statistically. Archer led the division with a whopping 16 blocks in the regular season, 6 more than the runner-up. Guo, senior Shirley Liu, and senior Kristina Kim also placed prominently at fifth with 57 kills, third with 85 assists, and fourth with 45 digs, respectively. As the setter and the libero of the team, Liu and Kim played integral roles in the Vixens’ scheme all season long.</p><p>However, the prospects for next season are both thrilling and worrisome: the starting lineup was comprised mainly of seniors, and the team will be losing seven in total. The Vixens will need players to step up if they want a shot at remaining at the level they currently are. “The future looks bright, but this moment sucks. The rest of the team is eager to fill up the spots, to get on the court and play, and they’re ready for it,” Choubaralian said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:01:29.962535	24	1	
247	﻿Greyducks’ Season Cut Short at City Championships	greyducks-season-cut-short-at-city-championships	<p>It was a chilly day at Van Cortlandt Park on Saturday, November 11, the day of the PSAL Cross Country City Championships. Goosebumps covered the bodies of the runners and the air they breathed turned white behind them as they ran towards the finish line. Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity cross country team, the Greyducks, fell short of qualifying for the New York State Federation Meet. The loss brought an untimely end to what had been a promising season for the Greyducks, leaving some members disappointed but others proud of their accomplishments.</p><p>Heading into the City Championships, the Greyducks were the underdogs once again, previously having been projected to lose to the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering in the Manhattan Borough Championships on Saturday, November 4. “We were expected to be ninth in the city based on our previous performances,” senior and co-captain Minhein Htet said. Only the top four teams in the City Championships qualify for the Federation Meet. In addition, the top 12 athletes not part of the four qualifying teams are eligible to run in the Federation Meet.</p><p>In the varsity five-kilometer race, sophomore Baird Johnson placed 21st with a time of 17:40.09, and senior Clive Johnston finished 29th with a time of 17:55.34. “Clive Johnston and Caleb Hoo ran tremendous races, both setting personal bests by a good margin. Baird Johnson also ran his fastest time of the season as well by about 35 seconds,” coach Carl DiSarno said. Hoo ran about 15 seconds faster than he had in the Borough Championships, and Johnston ran nearly 50 seconds faster than he had in those championships. However, these performances were not enough to qualify, as the Greyducks earned sixth place, just outside of the top four. Johnson and Johnston both qualified individually for the Federation Meet but both declined to compete for personal reasons.</p><p>Disarno’s strategy for the Greyducks was to get off to a good start and not fall behind early. “We needed to get out well and the seniors needed to run as a group,” he said. Moreover, if the seniors ran as a group, they would be able to block off runners from other teams trying to pass them. The Greyducks also needed one of the projected top four teams (Susan Wagner High School, Brooklyn Technical High School, The Bronx High School of Science, and Midwood High School) to slip up, but the team’s game plan failed as the above schools placed first, second, third, and fourth, respectively.</p><p>“We don’t have guys fast enough to beat the top guys of Midwood, but we were confident that all of our guys [could] beat their fourth man. Unfortunately, their fourth man ran exceptionally well and we were unable to make a gap big enough for us to beat Midwood. In addition, HSMSE also managed to place a few guys between our guys,” Htet said.</p><p>In the Borough Championships, Htet, Johnston, and Sit placed sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively. In the City Championships, 17 runners finished in between Johnston and Htet, and 21 runners finished in between Htet and Sit. Consequently, Stuyvesant finished behind HSMSE, who they had beaten just two weeks earlier at the Borough Championships.</p><p>In the junior varsity race, Stuyvesant placed eighth, with the final four qualifying teams being Brooklyn Technical High School, the Bronx High School of Science, the High School of American Studies, and Staten Island Technical High School, in that order.</p><p>Many Greyducks felt as if the team could have run better. “I’m not gonna mince my words. With the exception of a couple of guys who ran excellently, we all messed up big time,” Htet said. He also believed that the weather was an obstacle. “A bad race can happen to anyone and it just happened to hit some of our guys at a bad time,” he said.</p><p>Sit took a more positive approach than either Htet or Disarno to the loss. “I’m actually pretty satisfied with how the team performed. I choked up, but the rest of the team stepped up big. We mostly hit the times that we planned, but the rest of the competition also did much better,” he said.</p><p>Seniors Htet and Sit reflected on their final cross country season with the Greyducks. “I had fun this year. I have no regrets about joining this team. This sport and this team have become part of who I am. It’s sad to think about how I’m going to have to leave soon,” Htet said.</p><p>“It’s a shame that the season's over so quickly, but I know that every member was committed to the team from start to finish. Whether it was raining or freezing, they went to practice,” Sit said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:01:39.218566	24	1	The Greyducks did not qualify for the New York State Federation Meet and were disappointed in their performance, but they had a positive view of the season as a whole.

Whether these stories are heart-warming or poignant, they aren’t covered by the news. They should be.</p><p>In the midst of political and international strife, it’s more important now than ever that we begin to understand and accept the stories of those all around the world.

Whether it be through HONY’s long captions, the images themselves, or the thousands of Facebook comments that follow each post, there is always a message that can be extracted, or some sort of connection we can make. Through words and pictures about others, we’re getting to know these people, we’re feeling emotions that they’ve felt, and we’re learning from their lives—how things they’ve done or gone through can be lessons and shared experiences for us.</p><p>HONY isn’t just an outlet for entertainment or a pastime; I, for one, hope that it ends up being the future of journalism.

114	﻿Is DeShone Kizer Due to Be Another Cleveland Bust?	is-deshone-kizer-due-to-be-another-cleveland-bust	<p>JR: Hey Meech, were you planning on adding anything about how Kizer got benched for a game? Other than that this is a super interesting article and there is just some minor grammatical stuff.</p><p>Every time the Cleveland Browns start a new quarterback, it seems to cause waves of overwhelming euphoria, followed quickly by crippling disappointment. Since being reintroduced to the National Football League (NFL) in 1999, the Browns have not found an answer at the position. From Tim Couch and Brady Quinn to college standout Johnny Manziel and Washington castoff Robert Griffin III, when it comes to quarterbacks, nothing has worked for the Browns.</p><p>Through four games so far, this season looks to have been much of the same. With bottom-of-the-barrel totals in completion percentage (52 percent), passer rating (47.8), and touchdown-to-interception (TD:INT) ratio (3:11), rookie DeShone Kizer looks the part of another Cleveland bust.</p><p>To make matters worse, fellow rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson, whom the Browns had an opportunity to draft, has gone on a tear over his last four starts for the Houston Texans, leading all quarterbacks in rushing yards per game while going 3-2 as a starter (as opposed to 0-6 in Kizer’s case).</p><p>Furthermore, while Watson’s position as the Texans’ starter has gone unquestioned since he took over, Kizer’s grip on the Browns’ starting job seems to be coated in Vaseline. Over the course of the Browns’ 0-7 start, Kizer has been benched numerous times and for two different backup quarterbacks.</p><p>Against the New York Jets, Kizer was pulled at the start of the second half for Kevin Hogan in a desperate, vain attempt to escape with a close win. Then, after the Browns lost that game, 17-14, Hogan was given the start the following week in a loss to the Texans. After Hogan’s three-interception debacle, Kizer was given the start against the Tennessee Titans, but was again pulled just after halftime after throwing two revolting interceptions, this time for Cody Kessler. With Kessler now expected to start next week against the Vikings, 2017 looks like another lost season of ghastly quarterback plays for the Browns.</p><p>However, considering that the supporting cast that Kizer has to work with is subpar and that the Browns’ head coach, Hue Jackson, has been quite austere with young quarterbacks in the past, the outlook for Kizer and the Browns may not be as grim as it seems.</p><p>Kizer has fallen victim to two key factors: inadequate support from his wide receivers and an overzealous head coach. The first of these has not only been the most obvious but also the most egregious.</p><p>The Browns have been plagued with underperforming wide receivers all year, with no worse offender than this offseason’s marquee free agent pickup, Kenny Britt. Last season, Britt experienced a breakout for the Los Angeles Rams despite putrid quarterback play from Case Keenum and Jared Goff.</p><p>Britt eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career and showcased a consistent ability to get open for first downs, stay balanced, and make plays after the catch. This led to a four-year, $32.5 million contract from the Browns and an expectation that Britt would be not only a reliable target, but also a veteran mentor for youngsters Corey Coleman, Ricardo Louis, and Kasen Williams. So far, however, Britt has been all but that.</p><p>Britt’s hands and route-running have been inconsistent all season, but they were especially poor Week 4 against the Cincinnati Bengals. To put it bluntly, Britt cost the Browns two separate drives. Early in the first quarter, with the Browns on the Bengals’ 30-yard line and the potential to capitalize on a fumble by quarterback Andy Dalton, Britt had a prime opportunity to convert a long third down on a comeback route.</p><p>Though Kizer’s pass was slightly short, it was still certainly catchable, but Britt let it through his paws, forcing the Browns to settle for (and miss) a long field goal attempt. Later, in the second quarter, with the Browns within 20 yards of Cincinnati’s end zone, Kizer hit Britt squarely in the chest, but Britt allowed it to ricochet off and up for an easy interception, putting another demoralizing end to a potential touchdown drive.</p><p>Of course, not all of the blame can be put on Britt. Other members of the receiving corps—running back Isaiah Crowell, for example—dropped their own fair share of passes, and, more importantly, Kizer’s own flaws cannot be ignored. There is much to like about Kizer: he has a hefty throwing arm, his so-called “football intelligence” is extremely high, and he is adept at avoiding pressure from pass rushers and fluidly reestablishing his throwing mechanics on the move. However, he has one notable deficiency: his accuracy. Simply put, Kizer’s ball placement is poor to all levels of the field. While he can somewhat make up for it with his arm strength, it becomes an issue when so many of his passes are slightly off the mark.</p><p>This is especially problematic for the Browns. Wide receivers, after all, are not machines. They will catch most passes thrown to them, but will also naturally drop a fair share. With an inaccurate quarterback like Kizer, the drop rate will only go up since the receivers do not know where to expect the ball and then are forced to contort their bodies like the artistes of Cirque du Soleil to even attempt a catch. With a receiving corps as young as Cleveland’s, this is exacerbated by poor technique and a lack of football instincts. Hence, Kizer and his receivers only make each other look worse than they truly are.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Browns’ head coach and offensive coordinator Jackson has insisted on emphasizing an offensive scheme that plays away from the strengths of his receiving corps, which has only further exposed Kizer’s struggles. Seeing Kizer’s arm strength, patience against pressure, and ability to use fakes to manipulate defenders downfield, Jackson established a deep passing-heavy offensive scheme.</p><p>The problem with this approach is that the Browns’ wide receivers, running backs, and tight ends are not conducive to such an offense, especially with Corey Coleman, the Browns’ most explosive option, out with an injury. Britt is simply not fast enough to be a threat downfield, and Ricardo Louis and Kasen Williams, while supremely athletic, are too raw to actually gain consistent separation and are still unrefined in terms of seeing and tracking the ball and securing catches.</p><p>Furthermore, Jackson has almost completely abandoned the running game, despite having two capable running backs in Duke Johnson Jr. and Isaiah Crowell to work with. Crowell, supposedly the Browns’ lead running back, has averaged just 13 carries a game this season, a far cry from the typical workload of a feature back (Jordan Howard of the Chicago Bears, for instance), which normally hovers around 20 touches a game. Johnson, meanwhile, has gone full games without running the ball.</p><p>This is unfortunate to see since the Browns’ offense is young and has the potential to be one to feel excited about. However, for the Browns’ offense and Kizer to be successful, there must be two drastic measures taken. First, the Browns need to become more devoted to the run. Crowell is a gritty, powerful runner that enjoyed his first 1,000-yard season a year ago and is more than capable of carrying the Browns’ torch. Johnson, meanwhile, is a quicker option with receiving abilities to boot and can serve as a perfect complement. If the Browns had established the run against teams with weak linebackers, such as the Indianapolis Colts in Week 3, they could have had at least one win.</p><p>The next move would be to focus more on intermediate passing and play-action fakes. Play-action is when the quarterback fakes handing the ball to a running back, thereby drawing the defense out of position, and then proceeds to pass against a shifted, discombobulated defense. However, this can only happen with a strong run game; otherwise, defenders would not fall for the fake. With play-action implemented, the Browns could then integrate players like Britt, who thrives on intermediate curls and crossing routes, and big tight ends, like David Njoku and Seth DeValve, into a timing-based, quick-hitting offense that allows Kizer to use his strong arm to hit tight windows.</p><p>If that happens, then the horrid statistics that Kizer has put up week to week should begin to level off. As bad as Kizer has been, he has not been as bad as his 3:11 TD:INT ratio may indicate. In the modern NFL, such a figure is almost unheard of: the only quarterback last season to play in all 16 games and finish with more interceptions than touchdowns was Brock Osweiler, who was actually cut by the Browns this preseason.</p><p>If the problems in Kizer’s surrounding personnel can be mitigated, he should finally start to look like an acceptable NFL quarterback. From there, his future would depend on his growth. Kizer’s skill set is similar to that of Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who has built a Hall of Fame career out of extending plays and throwing deep. If Kizer improves his ball placement, allowing his receivers a better chance at the ball, we could see much of the same. However, if he stays inconsistent, he will remain in the doldrums of mediocrity.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:43:25.663811	25	1	Despite a rocky statistical start, DeShone Kizer still has a chance to be successful if the support around him improves.

The team won a combined 10-0 in the previous two games against High School of Fashion Industries and Dr. Susan S. Mckinney School of Art.</p><p>Led by a strong senior class, the team has been lights-out this season, currently second in its division at 7-2 behind Brooklyn Technical High School, who is at 9-0. The entire starting lineup, except for the second doubles team, is made up of seniors who have been on the team for at least a year and already know the drill. They understand the game and have learned the right mindset in order to be successful.</p><p>“[We] initially just try to go out there and do our best to win both doubles and win in the singles matches,” senior Alexander Lu said. By taking each game match by match, the team doesn’t get caught up in the overall picture and only focuses on each moment individually. This mindset allows the players to exert all their energy on the current play and to not worry about past matches.</p><p>On the sidelines before the MLK match, senior and captain Steve Wong stood firm and tall, using his racquet to practice his stroke. This purpose was twofold: to make sure he was ready for the game and also to gain a competitive edge by scaring his opponents. “Many of the opposing players were inexperienced and [...] I tried instilling a sense of uneasiness into those inexperienced players by showing them how aggressive and prepared I was,” Wong said.</p><p>Stepping into his doubles match against MLK with Lu, Wong winded up his racquet, ricocheting the shuttlecock over the net as the opposing players failed to answer. Evidently, this scare tactic worked, as he and Lu won their first set 21-0 and came out victorious in the remaining sets, gaining a point for Stuyvesant.</p><p>Coach Marvin Autry believes the experience of the seniors has played a big role in the team’s success. “Our starters know where they stand and are focused and poised because they know themselves better than anyone else,” Autry said. Most of the players independently prepare on the side before their actual match and at practice to understand what they need to improve upon or know what skills they have confidence in.</p><p>This team believes it can succeed this post-season. The past three years have all led to second-round exits in the playoffs, so hopefully this can be the year the team breaks through.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:43:52.405453	24	1	The boys’ badminton team has a mini three game winning streak and hopes to keep it up.

All five of the team’s starters shot well, outscoring the Engineers by 12 holes overall, with three of the team’s match victories coming at a margin of three holes or more.</p><p>The Birdies’ strong play landed them at the top of their division with an 8-0 record, three games ahead of James Madison High School. For the past four years, the team has succeeded in the Brooklyn A Division.</p><p>Last year, the Birdies performed similarly in the regular season, maintaining an undefeated season, but they failed to capitalize in the playoffs, losing to Staten Island Technical High School (2-3) in the second round. “We knew we definitely could have advanced to semifinals last year, so we were pretty disappointed,” sophomore Charlotte Yee said.</p><p>Though the playoff bracket is not completely set, the Birdies will likely have a bye in the first round of the playoffs, but they might face a familiar opponent in the second round.</p><p>In addition to the team playoffs, the top players in the PSAL are selected to compete in the individual competition. Last year, Stuyvesant sent four golfers to the individual championships, but they didn’t manage to chart on the top spots.</p><p>This year, senior Lucy Liu is the only one on the team attending the much smaller individual competition, and she will look to learn from her experience last year. However, winning in the individual competition will be tough due to strong competition from Hunter High School golfers.</p><p>The team has enjoyed this success because of coach Emilio Nieves. Golf is not as popular for students coming into Stuyvesant, so many of the players of the Birdies had to be taught the basics. “He really tried to diagnose what is wrong with my swing and helped me improve a lot,” Park said.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:44:02.635941	24	1	The Birdies have finished up another successful season and are now directing their attention to the playoffs
243	﻿Birdies’ Undefeated Season Ends	birdies-undefeated-season-ends	<p>The Birdies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ golf team, started their semifinals match against Tottenville fiercely as senior and first starter Catherine Joh defeated her opponent in the first hole. The team hoped to build momentum from this exhilarating victory. However, Joh lost the match by a final score of four up. The remaining four starters were unable to get a rally going, bringing the Birdies’ season to an end at the hands of powerhouse Tottenville, 5-0. “Certainly, we were slightly disappointed we didn’t advance to the finals, but to even get to play against Tottenville is an achievement in and of itself,” sophomore and second starter Charlotte Yee said.</p><p>Overall, however, the Birdies have no reason to be disappointed. “It was a pretty successful season. We won our first 10 games, made it to semifinals, played very well in semifinals, but lost to Tottenville. I was pretty happy because we showed we could play,” Coach Emilio Nieves said.</p><p>The team certainly did just that, finishing the regular season on top of the Brooklyn division for the fourth season in a row with an undefeated record of 9-0. In fact, the last time the Birdies lost a match in the regular season was the 2014-15 season, in which they finished with a record of 8-1.</p><p>The Birdies, however, have not been able to advance past the semifinals in the last four years, an obstacle they hope to overcome next season. This will be a tough task for a team that is losing its first and third starters, seniors Joh and Lucy Liu after this year. “We want to field a team [next season] equally as competitive as this year’s,”  Yee said.</p><p>Two players who hope to fill those spots are junior Jessica Park and sophomore Kristie Chu. “I want to play in more matches and dedicate myself to golf more, since this is the team I’ve been on since the end of my freshman year,” Park said. Chu expressed her determination as well: “Ideally, I would want for the team to be first in the city,” she said. Chu is not alone, as the team has high hopes for next season, and an appearance in the finals is certainly not out of reach.</p><p>“We have three out of five starters, so we should still have a good team. But that just gives the subs an opportunity to step up. The harder they work to step up, the more successful we’ll be next year,”  Nieves said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:01:10.664569	24	1	The Birdies look forward to next season with championship aspirations.
121	Peglegs Finishing Off a Strong Season	due-10-20	<p>The Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity soccer team, have earned themselves a spot in the playoffs. Approaching the end of their season with just one game left, the Peglegs are looking to end strong. This is their most successful season in years, currently sitting in second place with 21 points, just behind their long time rival Martin Luther King Jr. High School (MLK), with 27 points.</p><p>They have been nearly unbeatable these past few months, with a record of seven wins and two losses in their PSAL Manhattan A1 division. “With an eighth win and an 8-2 finish, we are hoping for a high seed in the playoffs,” Coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>Though the Peglegs have had a total of three postponed games this season, it has not stopped them from using each game as an opportunity to improve. “We've gotten better at being more aggressive and taking shots since the beginning of the season,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzberg said. This is reflected in the team's stats with the number of shots on goal in their most recent game doubling that of the number of shots in the match that started their season. Their shots peaked mid-season, reaching a total of 18 in one game against Washington Irving High School.</p><p>In their last game against Frederick Douglass Academy, the team showed resilience and a diversity of talent. At the end of the first half, the game was tied at two. This continued until the end of time, so the match went into overtime, a sudden death round. The Peglegs were able to finish off the game with a 3-2 win. This game showed the ability of many teammates to finish. Three goals were scored by three different people: juniors Jeffrey Shen and Robert Nava, along with sophomore Jeremy Moller. The development of these younger players have been crucial this year and will improve the team in the future.</p><p>As they continue to improve at both games and practice, the team reflects on how to do better. “Our strengths are definitely our defense and ability to counterattack. I think our possession has definitely improved. While it's not quite as much of a strength as I would like, we have shown the ability to dominate a game by possessing the ball,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said. Hopefully, the team can improve on their possession time.</p><p>As the playoffs approach, the Peglegs are looking to go as far as possible and, ideally, beat their main opponent, Martin Luther King Junior High School, if the opportunity arises. They have not lost hope despite their 4-0 loss in their first game against MLK, followed by a 5-0 loss to them later in the season. “We held MLK scoreless for 39 minutes, but [we] allowed them to score two in the final few minutes of the half. We have to remain focused and capitalize better on our chances. We also need to have a better response if MLK scores, so we don't let them get into a rhythm,” said Smith-Salzberg, referring to their second game.</p><p>It is clear that this team has the ability and skills to handle tougher teams such as MLK, but it is simply a matter of consistently playing hard. “I feel [that] if we play a third game against MLK, we will give them everything we have and play very hard to the final minute,” Coach Miller said.</p><p>Though the team will most likely not face MLK in the playoffs, they have high hopes that their improvement will produce positive results as they face new teams outside of their division for the first time. “The team has played with a great amount of grit and toughness [...] and an attitude that [they] can beat anyone in the city,” Miller said.</p><p>As the Peglegs finish up the final stretch of their season with numerous victories, it is clear that they can go far in the playoffs. They just need to become more focused and capitalize on the opportunities they get.</p>	108	4	f	2017-10-31 22:57:55.149	2017-11-23 07:46:04.134231	24	1	Stuy’s boys varsity soccer team, continue their successes as their season comes to an end, earning a spot in the playoffs.
129	﻿A Clean Break For the 2017-2018 ARISTA EC	a-clean-break-for-the-2017-2018-arista-ec	<p>“In the long run, we want ARISTA to serve the purpose of adding to and building up your character,” ARISTA President Nicholas Lee said. “That’s one of the things we want to focus ARISTA into becoming: not just an organization for your college applications, but an organization that holds actual meaning.”</p><p>The 2017-2018 ARISTA Executive Council (EC) is comprised of juniors Nicholas Lee, Sophie Feng, Luola Chen, Ryan Sui, and Selina Zou. They will serve as ARISTA’s President, Executive Vice President, and Vice Presidents of Tutoring, Web Development, and Events, respectively.</p><p>Previously, ARISTA was a chapter of the National Honors Society (NHS), a nationwide organization of high school students who exemplify the four pillars of scholarship, character, leadership, and service.</p><p>However, seniors Evelyn Gotlieb, Julia Ingram, Rodda John, Giselle Garcia, and Sharon Chao, the former EC, determined that they would not renew Stuyvesant’s membership with the NHS, and went on to ratify ARISTA’s Bylaws on Thursday, June 1, in conjunction with Principal Eric Contreras and Faculty Advisor Jo Mahoney.</p><p>The EC had been unknowingly adhering to ARISTA Guidelines, which were created by an organization much like the NHS that was located in New York City during the 1980s until it went bankrupt.</p><p>“I brought to the attention of the EC back in January or February that we were not in compliance with the NHS Constitution, and I started writing our Bylaws at that point in time with the goal that we would break away at some point in the future,” John said. “The way I had originally written [the Bylaws] was that we would stay in the NHS, but would purposefully ignore the specific tenets that did not apply to us. [This] wasn’t necessarily the most legal thing to do under the NHS [Constitution], but it was what we had decided was best.”</p><p>“Most of the high schools in the city do not [follow the NHS Constitution], but due to a complicated situation, we are not renewing our membership to the NHS,” Feng said. “Contreras was supposed to read all of the applications, but you can’t really expect him to read 300 plus applications in a school of this size. It’s almost impossible.”</p><p>Though the EC declined to comment on the context surrounding this “complicated situation,” Lee asserted that this turn of events is a welcome change. “Stuy[vesant] is one of the most unique schools in New York City and nationwide, so I feel like it wouldn’t be the best for students to be  subject to [the NHS’s] general laws. Instead, we want to create a Stuyvesant Honors Society in which our programs and our Bylaws reflect more of our community,” he said.</p><p>Changing the dynamic within ARISTA is the EC’s primary goal.“We are all trying to take this approach to becoming more [relatable] and less separated from the normal members of ARISTA,” Chen said. “Many of us have proposed bonding events so ARISTA members feel like they are a part of this overarching organization. [The former EC had] awards to recognize the most dedicated members of ARISTA.”</p><p>To highlight the pillar of service, the EC plans to restructure the events requirements in order to encourage members to volunteer for a spectrum of events. “This year, members will hopefully work with a diverse set of organizations. While changes are not set in stone, we're hoping that somehow we'll be able to work [toward] this goal and foster a stronger spirit of volunteerism in ARISTA,” Zou said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>“We want to get new events into ARISTA that not only are more fun for the volunteers, but will also hopefully create a more meaningful experience on both ends: our volunteers and the people that receive the work that they do,” Lee said.</p><p>In fact, when asked to describe their most meaningful experience in ARISTA thus far, each member of the EC spoke of a time that accentuated the collaborative nature of the organization.“One of the best things about ARISTA is that you can create these long lasting connections with people inside and outside of school and from all different walks of life,” Chen said.</p><p>Chen is working to bolster the effectiveness of the Tutoring Committee and better encompass these values. She also recognized that historically, peer tutoring has been a requirement that members struggle with successfully completing, and in order to remedy this, she hopes to find more effective alternatives to one-on-one peer tutoring.</p><p>Her primary goal, however, is to implement a system within the already pre-existing anonymous pairing system on their website that assigns tutees to tutors based on the teacher. “It resolves a few issues that I have encountered this year while tutoring,” she said. “Many teachers often teach at different paces and emphasize different aspects of the curriculum, so it’s really hard to find a meeting ground where the tutor is able to offer the tutee what they need in a tutor. It also helps the tutor go into teaching at ease. They aren’t just trying their best, but are prepared.”</p><p>With this growing dependence on the ARISTA’s online presence, the Communications Committee was absolved this year and replaced with the Web Development Committee. “The roles of the Communications Committee tended to be [making] Facebook posts, [advertising] events, occasionally [making] posters, and [making] a promotional video,” John said. “We’ve been shifting toward using the websites to manage the organization, not only for ARISTA, but for the [Student Union’s] ID website, application website for Big Sibs, and the Parent Teacher Conference website. All of those functions were managed by me in conjunction with the Web Development Committee.”</p><p>Sui plans to build on the efforts of John by making their online interface more user-friendly. ”We want to change the fact that you have to make separate accounts for all of these different websites, so it’s easier to access,” he said. “Right now, we want to speed up the process of checking AIS sheets and essays.”</p><p>The EC hopes that their efforts will positively color the experiences of ARISTA members and emphasize the importance of the four pillars. “By making all these changes, we can give ARISTA the actual depth to become this meaningful high school experience that isn’t a chore for people, but a life changing experience that people can take something away from,” Lee said.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:04:38.670597	1	1	“In the long run, we want ARISTA to serve the purpose of adding to and building up your character,” ARISTA President Nicholas Lee said. “That’s...
130	﻿Stuyvesant Goes National in National History Day Competition	stuyvesant-goes-national-in-national-history-day-competition	<p>Stuyvesant participated in the National History Day (NHD) competition for the second year in a row. In the New York State division, junior Shameek Rakshit placed second in the individual website category with his project “B.R. Ambedkar: Framing an Egalitarian India.” In the group website category, juniors Kristin Lin, Samantha Ngo, and Jenny Gao placed third with their project “Love Canal’s Toxic Relationship: Citizens Fight for Their Health Against an Apathetic Government.” Rakshit, Ngo, Lin, and Gao all qualified for the national level competition and will be travelling to Maryland on June 13.</p><p>The NHD competition is an annual history competition available to students throughout the U.S. Participants research a topic related to a theme. This year students were asked to frame their projects around the theme “Taking A Stand in History.” Participants were able to present  the topic as either a website, exhibit board, theatrical performance, film, or original documentary.</p><p>History teachers Eric Wisotzky and Robert Sandler were in charge of mentoring the teams. “I helped the kids pick the topics. I helped them research those topics and recommended good historians, I helped them get interviews with historians actually in the field. I helped them with the aesthetics of their websites or the aesthetics of their poster boards,” Sandler said.</p><p>Every student in Wisotzky’s U.S. History and Sandler’s AP U.S. History classes were required to submit a project, while it was optional for other U.S. History classes. “I like the idea of students working together and improving to solve a problem, and the problem is to create some really cool, visually impressive, but also academically rich, analysis of a historical moment,” Sandler said.</p><p>Stuyvesant held a school level competition that determined who would go to the city and state level competitions. “If you [did] well at the city competition at the Museum of the City of New York,  you [would] go to the state competition at Cooperstown, and if you [did] well [there], you [would] go to nationals at Maryland,” Sandler said.</p><p>Rakshit chose to create a website for his project. It focused on Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian historical figure born in the late 19th century. Due to his socioeconomic state, Dr. Ambedkar was treated as an untouchable, but he went on to lead the first successful movement toward dismantling India caste system, and was also one of the founding fathers of India. “He wrote India’s constitution and through it he embodied all of the principles of justice and equality that he had always advocated for,” Rakshit said. “I wanted to find out what [Dr.] Ambedkar’s policies did for the people they were supposed to empower. I wanted to understand this from the lower caste point of view.”</p><p>Like many others throughout the globe, Rakshit is awed by Dr. Ambedkar’s work. “I am still blown aback [by] the impact he had in shaping India [and] his struggle against not only British colonists, but also his fellow Indians. It is a really powerful message in our modern time when more and more people are getting involved in activism around empowering minorities and underprivileged people,” Rakshit said.</p><p>Unlike most Stuyvesant NHD participants, Rakshit entered the competition as an independent, or without a teacher. Instead, he heard of the competition from his friend and junior Michael Xu, president of the History Club. “I am thankful that he convinced me to do it,” Rakshit said. “I personally didn’t expect to get this far.”</p><p>Ngo, Lin, and Gao’s project focused on Love Canal, a town in upstate New York where residents demanded the U.S. government clean up a toxic waste dump created by the Hooker Chemical Company. This led to the creation of the Superfund Law, which forced the government to allocate a portion of its budget toward cleaning up toxic waste sites. “Before Love Canal there were 30,000 other toxic waste dumps in the country and the federal government wasn’t doing anything about it.  After Love Canal and the creation of Superfund, the federal government started taking responsibility for cleaning up these toxic waste dumps and that is why it is a turning point in environmental history,”  Ngo said.</p><p>The group decided to choose Love Canal as their topic due to its STEM prevalence. “I first learned about Love Canal through another class at Stuy[vesant]: Urban Ecology. [Though] we weren’t able to discuss the topic in depth, this project allowed me to go in-depth and explore all of the connections between Love Canal and environmental history,” Lin said.</p><p>Rakshit, Ngo, Lin, and Gao are now looking forward to the National NHD competition in Maryland. “I have enjoyed the entire process. [Going to Nationals] is just a bonus I feel.  I am excited to see what I can do at Nationals because the level of competition is pretty different there,” Rakshit said.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:05:16.393941	1	1	Stuyvesant participated in the National History Day (NHD) competition for the second year in a row and sent two teams to nationals
131	﻿Student Wins Best Paper Award at CNERT Workshop	student-wins-best-paper-award-at-cnert-workshop	<p>Junior Caleb Smith-Salzberg won the Best Paper Award for his entry, “Bridging the Digital Divide Between Research and Home Networks,” at the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) in Atlanta on May 1. He had previously presented his paper on April 21 at the New York University (NYU) Research Expo held at the Tandon School of Engineering.</p><p>Smith-Salzberg’s project aims to narrow the gap between the top-notch internet connections that researchers usually have with the much poorer quality connections that average Americans have. “I created a tool that makes it easy for researchers to exactly mimic the internet speeds and connections of an actual U.S. household that is sampled from a dataset of over 10 thousand households,” Smith-Salzberg said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Last year, Smith-Salzberg was admitted into NYU’s ARISE program, which gives high school students an opportunity to conduct search over the summer with researchers. Here, he began his project that would eventually lead to his paper. “I wanted to challenge myself with different coding problems and expand my knowledge of graphing and using libraries of code. I also wanted to work with huge amounts of data,” he said. His mentor in the program was Fraida Fund of the Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications lab at NYU.</p><p>Smith-Salzberg collaborated with Fund to finalize his research project during the summer. By the end of the program, he had programmed a successfully functioning script, and had completed his main goal. However, Smith-Salzberg and Fund continued to work extensively on the project after the program and the two worked together on Smith-Salzberg’s final paper.</p><p>Smith-Salzberg was able to first present his findings to field professionals and professors at the NYU Research Expo in late April. “It was extremely useful in preparation for the [IEEE INFOCOM],” he said.</p><p>A week later, Smith-Salzberg went to the IEEE INFOCOM conference to present his work. Out of the hundreds of participants, Smith-Salzberg competed directly against seven other presenters in his workshop, which focused on computer and networking experimental research.</p><p>Many of Smith-Salzberg’s competitors were graduate students and possessed more experience in the field of research. “I was very prepared for the presentation at the conference because at that point I had been pitching my project for around nine months. Making a presentation for a more professional audience was not very difficult,” he said. “I did not think I was going to win, and was super excited when it was announced.”</p><p>Smith-Salzberg  is eager to see people using and developing his tool. “All the code is open source, so anyone can suggest edits or built on it, “ he said. “I [learned] a great deal about the importance of reproducibility in research, and taking note of everything done.”</p><p>He is excited about the future of the program and encourages more students to take advantage of the computer science program at Stuyvesant. “After spending the summer with many graduate students who major or minor in computer science, I can say Stuyvesant prepares you extraordinarily well for the field,” Smith-Salzberg said.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:05:59.901587	1	1	Junior Caleb Smith-Salzberg wins best paper award at IEEE INFOCOM CNERT workshop.

The visit, titled “Behind Bars: A Look at the American Prison System,” aligned with Stuyvesant Amnesty International’s goals to educate students on human rights and encourage student action.</p><p>Bernal began by describing his experience living in crime-infested Hudson County, New Jersey. He went on to describe his move to the largely upper class Bergen County, as his parents believed the Hudson County environment was having a negative effect on him. However, moving to Bergen County did not stop Bernal from stealing bicycles and vandalizing walls.</p><p>Bernal was eventually arrested after getting into a fight with a group of teens who harassed him. He was later told that as a result of the fight, two people were dead and two were injured.</p><p>Bernal was presumed to have caused the deaths and injuries, and was charged with provocation manslaughter. He was tried as an adult, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He went through multiple pleas for parole and was eventually released on October 18, 2004, after serving 12 years.</p><p>In his speech, Bernal emphasized the ineffectiveness of the prison system and tried to spread awareness. “Nothing's [going to] change in the prison system, nothing's [going to] change in the world if people don't care,” Bernal said. “I want to help anyone who is on the wrong path get back on the right path.”</p><p>Co-presidents and juniors Selina Zou and Nowshin Islam met Bernal at an Amnesty International workshop at Columbia University in March where he spoke about solitary confinement. “Sometimes we can get stuck in our own little bubbles at Stuyvesant, which is completely understandable, but we brought Carlos to remind people that there is a lot going on outside of these school walls and that we should care,” junior and co-vice president Joyce Wu said.</p><p>The visit had an effect on many of the students in the audience.  “[I] never really heard a story like his before. I was in awe of how he constantly stayed hopeful in all his time in prison, with his main motivation being his mother. I was glad to hear that after prison he still did not give up on life and was able to start his own business and family. And then started going around to different schools to share his story.” junior Levi Olevsky said.</p><p>Bernal ended by challenging conceptions of the prison experience. “[Prison is] not like the movies, not like candyland, something in between. You just have to find and navigate through it. [...] My biggest takeaway is that you can be the good change,” Bernal said.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:13:03.124747	1	1	“Nothing's [going to] change in the prison system, nothing's [going to] change in the world if people don't care.” —Carlos Bernal, motivational speaker and personal...

The event provided an opportunity for 175 high-school students from the U.S. and Canada to learn about and to immerse themselves in computer science.</p><p>A hackathon is an event where programmers can collaborate on a range of computer science projects. The hackathon organizers secured the sponsorship of a number of technology companies, including Facebook, MakeSchool, RedSeal, and ThoughtWorks, to subsidize the event. The event was held in the Midtown office of ThoughtWorks.</p><p>StuyHacks worked together with the computer science department and the Dojo, which is an afterschool community for computer science enthusiasts, to recruit mentors to help teach at the hackathon. “Mentors [were] generally college students who are majoring in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Some mentors [were] also students from Stuyvesant who are currently taking post-AP level courses,” senior and StuyHacks logistics director Prangon Ghose said.</p><p>During the hackathon, attendees were organized into groups of two to four for a team-building session. These teams competed against one another as they worked on a variety of programming projects, from developing a mobile app to building a robot.</p><p>Alongside the competitions, multiple workshops were held throughout the event to teach attendees different computer science skills and languages. For example, junior Shakil Rafi led the Android Development workshop, which taught participants how to code apps for the Android operating system.</p><p>At the end of StuyHacks IV, a panel of judges evaluated the group projects and gave out multiple awards based off of them. Seniors Nicholas Ng, Anya Keller, Mikhail Kotlik, and Daniel Monteagudo came in third place for the best overall project award for their work on Politalk, a website inspired by the 2016 election that connects people with opposing political ideologies through a chat app.</p><p>For future hackathons, StuyHacks organizers hope to increase funding to expand the event by reserving a larger venue and adding more workshops. Despite this, StuyHacks IV was well received by many of its attendees. “Having been to past StuyHacks, it is amazing to see all the improvements done over the years to benefit programmers,” senior Kevin Zhang said.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:14:09.389224	1	1	StuyHacks hosts its fourth hackathon to emerge high-school students in computer science.
137	﻿Kinet-X: Three Juniors’ Mission to Teach STEM to Younger Minds	kinet-x-three-juniors-mission-to-teach-stem-to-younger-minds	<p>“Seeing a kid’s eyes light up when their code works is a feeling that you really can’t match.” ––Adam Abbas, junior</p><p>Stuyvesant serves as an intellectual incubator; students are given the opportunity to learn and grow alongside professionals in various fields.  Renowned in particular for its computer science department, Stuyvesant allows students to hone in on their engineering interests through a multitude of courses and extracurriculars, both inside and outside of the school.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sea of opportunity is relatively exclusive to Stuyvesant and other specialized high schools. For example, out of over 42,000 high schools in the United States, only about 2,100 are certified to teach computer science. In schools that do offer the course, teachers often aren’t required to hold a degree with a concentration in the field. Computer science and engineering courses are even more scarce in elementary and secondary schools.</p><p>Juniors Adam Abbas, Chauncey Lau, and Allan Wang quickly identified and tried to reconcile this gap in education. When the trio joined Stuyvesant’s Robotics team, they were shocked to discover how little the incoming members of the team actually knew. In January of 2016, Abbas, Lau, and Wang originally came up with the idea to run a small Robotics training camp for incoming Stuyvesant freshmen.</p><p>However, upon further research and the discovery that lack of STEM education was a trend countrywide, they decided to do what they could to change that. “We realized that the issue, [ a lack of STEM education],  applied to everyone, not just people interested in robotics. So, we expanded our idea to teach basic STEM concepts,” explains Lau. Months of planning, hours of email drafting, advertising, marketing, meetings with tech companies, and late nights culminated into the group’s initiative: Kinet-X.The idea for a small training camp for Stuyvesant newcomers evolved into a four-week summer immersion program.</p><p>“I remember thinking that we had to have snacks set up. Before we started teaching on our first day, we ran everyone through a brainstorming workshop. We wanted to see the level of our students and also to get them to start thinking in the less traditional, memorization based way,” Abbas said. “I was really scared that when I started teaching they just really wouldn’t enjoy it. A lot of people just don’t like CS, and being responsible for trying to inspire a room of kids is tough. There really wasn’t anything I could do other than follow my lesson plan and just make sure everyone was having the best time possible.”</p><p>“One big problem was finding a place to host our program. We thought about using a co-working space, but that would bump up the price [of the program] significantly,” explained Lau. “We reached out to a couple of places and found that people were willing to help us out. We worked with Beam Center, an amazing place with all of the materials and space we could ever need.”</p><p>That summer, Abbas taught web development and JavaScript to a group of five students, Lau introduced soldering and circuitry, and Wang continued to work on marketing of the program.</p><p>The three friends had all been exposed to basic engineering and computer science education: Abbas took computer science courses in middle school, Lau learned from his father, an electrical engineer, and Wang taught himself code at the age of eleven.</p><p>“When I was younger, my father was pretty busy with work. When he did get home, he’d always be tinkering with something, so my interactions with him always involved teaching me something related to technology,” Lau recalled. “He once yelled at me for creating a short circuit, which is basically when you connect a battery to itself. I didn’t understand why, so I did it again by myself, and the battery got really hot and burned me.”</p><p>The trio’s own hands-on experiences with STEM in childhood is reflected in how teaching is approached at Kinet-X: all lessons revolve around project based learning, as opposed to the typical lecture based classroom setting.</p><p>“We’ve made solar powered cars from parts from old computers, which was pretty cool because they had to find things that can act as wheels, chassis and other things from scrap. I want them to realize that not only is this really fun, but also super useful,” Lau said. “I like showing my students what happens when you mess up, so they don’t get too curious and hurt themselves on their own. That’s the only way to teach kids without them getting bored and hating the topic.”</p><p>Now, Kinet-X offers twelve weekend sessions of the same curriculum to a group of ten 10-13 year-olds. Kinet-X’s program targets all middle schoolers, regardless of socioeconomic background. The program gets no outside funding and covers costs of equipment and other expenses through tuition rates: $1350 for the summer. However, financial-aid is offered for those who cannot afford to pay full price.</p><p>The Kinet-X day is split up into two parts—engineering and programming. Students spend three hours in the beginning of the day going over engineering concepts such as soldering, circuitry, and electricity. They are then given an hour lunch break that they can use to relax, socialize, or work on their projects. Post-break, students finish the day with a three-hour programming session, where they spend their time learning programming concepts and applying them to projects and other activities.</p><p>“When I am teaching off of a PowerPoint, I try to make it as engaging as possible, with puzzles and thought-provoking questions woven between the bullet points and factoids,” Abbas explained. “In the engineering portion, entire lessons can be spent soldering a circuit together or building a project.”</p><p>“The best part is when you see how focused the kids are and how much they want to solve the issues they’ve come across,” Lau said. “The worst part is when they start getting a bit too rowdy and become safety hazards; but, that doesn’t happen too often, and it’s easy to calm them down.”</p><p>What makes Kinet-X unique is its teachers—the closeness in age between teacher and student, obvious aptitude of the instructors in their subject areas, as well as the passion those instructors hold––evident when Abbas’s eyes lit up whilst describing their mission. “We focus more on inspiring our students, rather than just passing on knowledge and information for them to spit back out at us,” Adam said. “We want them to fall in love with STEM and pursue it outside of our classes. We want our students to come back to us and ask to help-out, or for more resources, or for assistance on a code that all of us wrote together. Personally, I want to see my students a year from now and feel like my class stuck with them.”</p><p>For their 2017 summer immersion program,  Kinet-X has expanded to include an intermediate level to their curriculum. “Our students kept telling us they wished they had an opportunity to take our classes again and learn more,” Abbas explained. The intermediate course introduces Python and Arduino to students.</p><p>The trio plan to continue to expand their program to include a greater variety of classes and grow their following to include more students. Publicity from various publications, including foreign language newspapers and the Wall Street Journal, help Kinet-X attract an even greater following.</p><p>As a result of the program’s rapid growth, Abbas, Lau, and Wang all plan to remain in New York City post-high school to further expand and develop their vision. “It’s a big part of our lives, and we’d really like to continue it when we’re in college, if we get in,” Lau said.  “That being said, if we’re not able to work on it personally, we’ve taken precautions to make sure it continues with other people in charge.”</p><p>Though juggling a new start-up and other responsibilities, like school-work, seems daunting, staying conscious of Kinet-X’s impact helps its founders stay grounded. “When I was on the robotics team, I was helping myself and my team, and learning new things. But it wasn’t fulfilling work or knowledge for me. Kinet-X lets me actually make a difference. I learn so much through teaching, and seeing a kid’s eyes light up when their code works is a feeling that you really can’t match,” Abbas said.</p><p>Their advice to anyone looking to start their own business is to start with a passion, and see what ways it can be utilized to make a difference. “What problems are there? What do people wish was changed?” Abbas said. “You might end up only working on a project on a small scale, but if you keep trying to solve issues and follow what you already know and do, you’ll eventually find what works for you and be able to continue on with it.”</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:17:42.883633	3	1	“Seeing a kid’s eyes light up when their code works is a feeling that you really can’t match.” ––Adam Abbas, junior
139	﻿Uncontested; Unelected?	uncontested-unelected	<p>An unopposed candidacy might signify incredible popularity, and a margin of victory of 100 percent. It could also signify a lack of opposition, and of civic engagement. In the worst case, the election may be coerced. James Monroe was elected President of the United States by a margin of 228-1 in 1820; Kim Jong-un was elected President of North Korea by a margin of 687-0 in 2014. From overwhelming approval to coercion, the most recent Student Union (SU) elections fall somewhere in between.</p><p>Bitter liberals like to whine about the low democratic turnout in America’s presidential election, but Stuyvesant is much worse, routinely seeing only a minority of the student body vote. This year, the SU and Senior Caucus elections stooped to a new level of apathy, each featuring a single candidacy. Junior Kevin Boodram, who ran for caucus three times in the past, said, “ I don’t think people understand what the Student Union does. I think that discourages a lot people from running in the first place, even voting.” His older brother’s friends told him the SU was only good for planning parties.</p><p>Yet the SU organizes perhaps the biggest display of school spirit each year, SING!. The SU’s impressive budget of over $100,000 is what makes clubs and publications possible. And the President and Vice President routinely meet with school administration as the ones advocating for the student body. Perhaps it is time to pay more attention to election season.</p><p>If presented with the opportunity to cast a ballot, I surely would have voted for Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino for Student Union President and Vice President, as well as for Pallab Saha and Abie Rohrig for Senior Caucus; the problem, however, is that not a single ballot was cast. With the student body’s interests at stake, it is dangerous to have an uncontested—and therefore unelected—official in power (see North Korea).</p><p>A more troubling trend, however, seems to be damaging SU elections: the toxic environment surrounding challenges to the incumbent. Most recently, sophomore Abner Kahan faced personal attacks over Facebook for trying to run for positions in the Student Union. “Most people laughed at me and didn’t take me seriously. Some were even slightly hostile,” Kahan said.</p><p>Hostility directly discourages students from running. It is hard enough to break into the SU—incumbents have the advantage of knowing the organization’s inner-workings, evidenced by a six-year chain of SU Vice Presidents becoming President. Bullying is not only degrading, but makes the task impossible; Kahan gave up on running for Student Union, and eventually pulled out of the Junior Caucus race—his ideas were effectively silenced.</p><p>Boodram added that it is very difficult for candidates to run after suffering a loss. “If you lose a campaign, and you try to do anything after that, people are always going to flame you and say you’re salty or whatever and criticize you for trying to run again,” he said, nodding vigorously when asked if he was bullied. Stuyvesant students are quick to transgress the boundary from debating policies to personal attacks.</p><p>SU elections have always been meaningful; now it is time for the student body to treat them professionally. Innovation and competition are crucial to testing ideas and ensuring our Student Union provides us with the best experience they can, but this is only possible if we are open to new ideas and have the confidence that, when we choose to speak out, others will respect our voices.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:19:26.153717	2	1

For just $8.75, this dish combines rich Yunnan history and flavor into one large, hot bowl of soup. Supposedly, a woman used to cross a bridge everyday in the Yunnan province to bring her husband this dish, and she found that the soup stayed warm when covered in a layer of chicken fat and that it tasted best when all the toppings and noodles were added last, so that is exactly how the dish is served today.</p><p>Rice Noodles</p><p>$5.75-$6.75</p><p>The restaurant is famous for its housemade rice noodles, and any of its rice noodle dishes are a must-try. The thick, slimy white noodles combined with salty beef or pork stew and toppings from coconut skin to crispy meat sauce make for a filling meal. You can customize the spiciness with the chili oil, which includes hot peppercorns and red chili flakes.</p><p>Cold Sliced Cucumber Salad</p><p>$5.00</p><p>Under the “Garden” heading on the menu, you can find an assortment of tasty sides, one of the best being the Cold Sliced Cucumber Salad (or pickled cucumbers).

146	﻿Everything, Everything About This Love Story	everything-everything-about-this-love-story	<p>Imagine never leaving your house for 17 years, never being able to go outside, never seeing the ocean, despite it only being three miles away from your house, and never having much physical contact with others, with only the Internet and books to base real life on.</p><p>That is the life doe-eyed protagonist Maddy Whittier (Amandla Stenberg) has to live. Diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), she is trapped in her house, as she would get sick if she walked outside. Spoiler alert: she does not die.</p><p>Instead, she is saved by her undying love for Olly Bright (Nick Robinson), the boy next door who is a gentleman that desperately needs a haircut.</p><p>Directed by Stella Meghie, “Everything, Everything,” is a riveting love story about an intelligent girl who is drawn outdoors once she starts texting a boy who just became her neighbor. As based on the book by Nicola Yoon, Maddy only starts asking questions about her illness and her monotonous life as she falls more in love with Olly and begins to feel trapped.</p><p>Stenberg and Robinson are able to sell Maddy and Olly’s love with their undeniable chemistry. They have everything down, from the way they lovingly look at each other in the car to the way Olly’s face lights up with concern and fear as soon as he sees Maddy outside. The duo allows their flirty banter to seem genuine and emotional rather than cheesy and cliché, building off of each other’s thoughts seamlessly without overdoing the laughter and the blushes. The flawless acting makes many root for the star-crossed lovers, especially when they throw caution into the wind and kiss for the first time, which can end Maddy’s life.</p><p>Maddy and Olly’s love is only amplified with Meghie’s stylistic choices. Instead of showing two people texting, which is what this couple is forced to do the majority of the time, Meghie decides to use Maddy’s architecture class to her advantage. For assignments, Maddy is forced to build diners, libraries, and houses. Maddy then imagines all of her and Olly’s texts to be said face-to-face in these architectural models. Whenever she picks up her phone and smiles, the camera fades into her imagination, emitting a whimsical, dreamy aura as they share their true feelings. This only enhances Maddy and Olly’s love story; having the audience see Stenberg and Robinson say the texts out loud with passion illustrates the true emotions they feel when they text each other. Their love, figuratively and literally, comes off the screen.</p><p>The movie, however, has obvious discontinuities. For example, Maddy states at the beginning of the film that she has 100 white t-shirts, but she is only seen in one in the starting scene and wears blue crop tops for the rest of the movie. In addition, Olly comments that Maddy is too close to him the third time they are five feet apart from each other. While many die-hard romance fans will shrug off these moments, those who aren’t as keen on romance will have problems with this.</p><p>In fact, some who are not as inclined to romance movies might be disgusted by the unrealistic fantasy that “Everything, Everything” describes. Skeptics would notice the sheer impossibility of things such as Maddy and Olly’s trip to Hawaii occurring. How did Maddy get on the airplane without a photo I.D., which is something she would be unlikely to get if she’s been trapped in her house for 17 years? How is she going to afford the trip once her credit card bill arrives in the mail? While some may only pay attention to the adorable couple, others will note the absurdity of the plot.</p><p>Those who have read the book, however, will expect this impractical romance, as the movie surprisingly sticks firmly to the plot of the book. The minor details left out of the movie, such as Olly knowing how to do a handstand or having a rooftop hideout, are easily forgotten. Some changes are even beneficial to the plot, such as Carla’s, Maddy’s nurse, daughter (Danube R. Hermosillo) playing a bigger role in Maddy’s life, visiting her to talk about Maddy’s budding social life.</p><p>However, one missed addition from the novel was Olly making sure Maddy had a condom before they had sex. The sex scene was refreshingly tame, but this one detail from the book would have gone a long way had it been included in the film. The film would have taught its audience about the reality of contraceptives, something historically not touched on in TV shows and movies and especially important with the teenage audience this movie targets.</p><p>The movie has been praised for its diverse cast, as Amandla Stenberg, a black girl, plays the lead in a love story. A major upside with this story is how it allows a girl of color to fall in love with a white boy on the big screen without race playing a large factor in the plot, normalizing the concept of interracial couples. Additionally, Meghie, the director of the film, is the only black female director thus far in 2017 to come out with a wide-release movie. Yoon, the author of the book “Everything, Everything” is based on, is an immigrant from Jamaica, and she has spoken about how important it is for all races to be represented in media. Her novel and its movie adaptation is a step in the right direction.</p><p>The movie, however, has been criticized for misrepresenting SCID, the disease Maddy has. The Immune Deficiency Foundation released a press statement this week condemning the inaccuracies the movie presented, such as when Maddy describes it as “being allergic to everything.” These inaccuracies are intentional, as the audience is not taught about the destructiveness of SCID. Instead, they learn about the horrors of Munchausen by proxy, a mental disorder where a caretaker makes their child believe that they have some sort of terminal illness. The film accurately depicts symptoms for Munchausen by proxy, with the mother being highly interested in medical affairs. Because of this, the SCID symptoms Maddy exhibits should not be taken seriously. Instead, they should be used to combat stereotypes about people with SCID, such as having to live in highly quarantined areas.</p><p>“Everything, Everything” originally sounds like a similar story to “The Fault In Our Stars,” with the illnesses and the impromptu magical vacation. However, the themes that “Everything, Everything” touch on are completely different, focusing on the nuances and contradictions that love and family bring instead of constantly reminding the audience of life and death, like “The Fault In Our Stars” does. While “The Fault in Our Stars” emphasizes the importance of living life to the fullest, “Everything, Everything” stresses forming relationships with others and understanding others’ motives.</p><p>And, of course, no one dies at the end of “Everything, Everything.”</p><p>The thing about both of these films is that despite all the horrible things Maddy and Hazel, the protagonist of “The Fault In Our Stars,” go through, their spirits are not crushed. They can still live with their head held high. While Maddy and Hazel are both terminally ill and have amazing romances, they do not allow these things to define them. Each of them are still her own person. “Everything, Everything” is powerful for this reason and sends the message to viewers that no matter what, you can power through anything.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:26:27.785775	13	1	“Everything, Everything” is a well-done romantic movie for those who are into the genre.

In her 2017 book, “How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life,” Lilly Singh’s witty, heartfelt words of wisdom take the form of the cool aunt you wish you had.</p><p>Singh’s aptly named book is an extensive how-to guide on absolutely winning at life. When giving life and career advice, she draws from personal experience as her primary source material. The integration of personal anecdotes in her unadulterated advice gives “How to Be a Bawse” its sense of intimacy.</p><p>She establishes the informal nature of her book in the introduction, stating “I’m not an expert and I’m not claiming to be one…I’m writing this…because I want to be a positive light in this world.” In this statement, the book’s purpose is made clear: Singh, as a wildly successful entertainer, entrepreneur, and all-around bawse, has reached out to the public in book-form to share her secrets and help us all achieve total bawsedom.</p><p>However, bits and pieces of Lilly Singh existed in the public sphere long before she published her book. Her loud, confident, and refreshingly honest voice has graced the computer screens of millions since 2010, when she started her YouTube channel, “IISuperwomanII.” On this channel, she primarily posts a variety of comedic skits relating to certain aspects of her life, the most notable of which are videos impersonating her Punjabi parents, Manjeet and Paramjeet Singh, reacting to pop culture and the modern world.</p><p>When she first created her channel, she was a recent college graduate who filmed videos as a means of alleviating her crippling depression. “IISuperwomanII” has acquired 11 million subscribers and 1.8 billion views in the six and a half years following, making Singh one of the most successful YouTube celebrities of all time.</p><p>She nods to her former battle with depression many times throughout the book. Many of the life lessons covered in “How to Be a Bawse” are ones she has learned in her long, grueling path to recovery. In her introduction, she establishes that she is writing from the perspective of someone who has overcome depression.</p><p>Her book is divided into four sections, titled “Master Your Mind,” “Hustle Harder,” “Make Heads Turn,” and “Be a Unicorn.” Each section consists of nine to 17 chapters of mini-lessons and pieces of advice and ends with a feature called “Out of the Blue,” where she looks back on a moment in her life when she was depressed and contrasts it with her life after recovery.</p><p>Singh’s second installation of “Out of the Blue” recalls her state of mind in 2010 and 2015. She felt unimportant and invisible in 2010—the temple being her only sanctuary. “I go there every day and sit in the back, as far away from everyone else as possible. But I still feel as if everyone is looking at me.” She notes that in 2015, having people look at her has become a positive aspect of her life: “I see a huge sign with flashing lights outside the venue that reads ‘Lilly Singh’s “A Trip to Unicorn Island”—SOLD OUT.’”</p><p>The optimistic side-by-side comparison of the before and after is especially uplifting and refreshing, particularly to those struggling with depression themselves. It reinforces and cements all of the ideas conveyed in the book by reminding readers that life can—and does—get better.</p><p>Excluding the recurring feature “Out of the Blue,” “How to Be a Bawse” has 50 chapters in total. Each chapter conveys a new life lesson in around three to five pages. Some chapters have cliché titles like “Don’t Overthink” and “Commit to Your Decisions,” while others have titles that are distinctly Lilly Singh, such as “Send the GPS Deep,” where she tells you to be introspective and address your inner issues.</p><p>Each chapter achieves the perfect balance between hilarity and seriousness, articulating genuine, sincere pieces of advice with “Game of Thrones” references and funny poems about vodka and soda. Singh’s success as a YouTuber is evident in her writing style, from the quippy, anecdotal intros to every chapter to the colloquialisms she uses to convey her ideas.</p><p>In her opening paragraph to “Let Go of FOMO,” she draws her reader in with an interesting, relatable concept: “If I had a dollar for every time I was tempted to hang out with friends instead of doing work, I’d have a yacht made of gold.” She closes off the paragraph with the hashtag “#YachtGoals,” a model example of the humorous language that has won over her young fanbase in her book and videos alike.</p><p>While Singh’s writing style is very resemblant of her vlogging style, many YouTubers who have written books have chosen to divert from their vlogging style, writing long, detailed sections of prose in the style of a traditional novel.</p><p>Though exploring every lesson in depth would have added a wonderful new dimension to “How to Be a Bawse” and the public’s perception of Lilly Singh, the concise, unconventional style the book is written in conveys Singh’s messages just as well. Through her writing, Singh brings an extra touch of heart to her already stellar advice.</p><p>There is no better person to tell you to get some exercise than the person who prefaces the “Be Active” chapter of her book with, “I am literally LOLing as I write this chapter because I am the least qualified person to do so.”</p><p>The layout of the book’s hardcover copy is similarly bright—before every chapter, a bold, stunning professional photo of Singh takes up a full page. Almost every page is touched with neon colors, and most chapters have at least one outquote in a bright color and a bolded, stylish font. The lively color scheme and uplifting, bolded outquotes reinforce the book’s positive message and the importance of self-betterment.</p><p>The way “How to Be a Bawse” exhibits Lilly Singh’s trademark boldness has garnered an overwhelmingly positive reaction from Singh’s long-time fans and has also won the hearts of new fans. As of May 2017, the book has become a #1 New York Times bestseller, and it currently has a whopping 4.8 out of 5 stars on Amazon.</p><p>There are many reasons why this book could have achieved these impressive feats, but above all, its success can be attributed to the fact that it is a true anomaly. It is simultaneously sentimental and practical, silly and sincere, and a gold mine of wisdom.</p><p>Without a doubt, “How to Be a Bawse” is a must-have for every human being struggling through life on this cold, lonely planet, aka every human, period.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:30:40.506915	15	1	A review of Lilly Singh’s new book “How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life.”

It had high expectations to live up to, thanks to the popularity of its prequel and the two Marvel movies that preceded it, “Captain America: Civil War” and “Doctor Strange.” With stunning visuals of the intergalactic world, witty banter, and the unforgettable soundtrack known as “Awesome Mix Vol. 2,” the film will definitely be ranked along with the others as a success.</p><p>“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is about the Guardians, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Baby Groot, continuing their journey throughout the cosmos. Along the way, they run into Ego, a god who claims to be the father of Star-Lord, or Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). When Ego is revealed to be their true enemy, the team manages to work out disputes and grow closer in order to take him down.</p><p>Though its thrilling space battles and futuristic technology make it the ideal action or science fiction movie, what really makes the film stand out is its focus on family.</p><p>The movie shows perhaps the most interesting relationship between two female siblings in a Marvel movie. Sisters Gamora and Nebula were nemeses, to the point where neither one would hesitate to kill the other if needed.</p><p>The circumstances of their rivalry (with their father replacing a part of Nebula with machinery every time she lost in combat to Gamora) make it a situation many can relate to. At its core, the problem boils down to Nebula feeling outshined by her older sister and unappreciated by her father. Those with older siblings would definitely be able to form some sort of emotional connection to this, giving a powerful emotional payoff.</p><p>As an act of vengeance, Nebula vows to kill Gamora and her father for the pain she went through. She steals a ship in order to hunt Gamora down and they engage in an almost deadly fight once she finds her. After their battle ends in a draw, Nebula says one of the most powerful lines of the movie: “You always wanted to win. I just wanted a sister.”</p><p>Through this line, Nebula changes from an enemy to a victim in both Gamora’s and the viewer’s eyes. Gamora’s understanding of Nebula’s true feelings allows the two to finally reach an armistice and work together as an unshakable team, with each one willing to save the other’s life without hesitation. Their sweet hug toward the end of the movie represents the union of a family, in which Nebula finally gets the sister she had always wanted.</p><p>The conflict between the Guardians themselves is a bit cliché; Marvel already used the “unable to work as a team” plot tool in both of their “Avengers” movies. The argument between Peter and Rocket about who is the best pilot fails to stir any sort of emotion within the viewer, instead looking more like a typical bout over dominance between two males. Drax’s obnoxious personality, Rocket’s refusal of letting anyone get close to him and the team’s general inability to understand one another cause an amount of feuds that is borderline tiresome.</p><p>Even the revelation of Ego’s sinister nature, which is the main plot line of the film, feels overplayed. Dozens of movies, a notable example being “Star Wars” regarding Darth Vader, have used the “character’s long lost relative is actually evil” theme.</p><p>It’s the growth of each Guardian that makes the movie special and allows them to become more of a family rather than a simple team. Rocket finds it within himself to admit he cares for his teammates. Drax is the one who declares them a family. During the final battle, each Guardian is unwilling to leave any member behind, even if it means death. Their character developments weave together to create a beautiful story of a family that refuses to leave anyone behind.</p><p>The driving force of the entire movie is Yondu. Despite being a former enemy and almost maniacal when it comes to using his trademark red arrow to murder his own traitorous crew members, who tried to stop him from reaching the Guardians, he ends up being the most significant hero of all.</p><p>Yondu is the one who looks out for Peter the most. His true intentions of raising Peter himself instead of returning him to Ego turn out to be honest and noble, and he ends up being the one to teach Star-Lord how to master his newfound celestial power. Yondu’s character arc of him growing from a hated villain to a valiant father figure and Guardian results in one of the most riveting villain-turned-hero stories in The Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p>“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is unable to recreate the original fun and greatness of the first. However, by choosing to make it a tale of family, it strengthens the emotional impact on the viewer and proves itself to be a worthy cinematic piece without needing to use the fame behind its prequel or the Marvel brand.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:35:41.407695	13	1	Though its thrilling space battles and futuristic technology make it the ideal action or science fiction movie, what really makes it stand out is its...
154	﻿The Privilege of Peeing	the-privilege-of-peeing	<p>The curtains of the Murray Kahn Theater opened to a grim color scheme of yellow and black, topped with a garbage green brick wall that read “Public Amenity #9,” the most disgusting urinal in town. The arrangement of set pieces was intentionally messy, setting a backdrop for the varying levels of chaos that would ensue for the duration of the show.</p><p>The Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)’s 2017 spring musical comedy, “Urinetown,” can only be described as a brilliantly orchestrated disaster. From atrocious, mismatched outfits to the use of toilet paper as twirling ribbons, impeccable choices were made in all departments to capture the crooked, chaotic universe of “Urinetown.” The show, directed by seniors Enver Ramadani and Dennis Ronel and sophomore Kareena Singh, ran on May 31 and June 2-3, and made for one of the most impressive STC shows in a while.</p><p>“Urinetown” is set in a fictional town that has suffered from a 20-year drought, which has led to the privatization of all of the toilets in town. The toilets, or filthy public amenities, are controlled by the Urine Good Company (UGC), led by the villainous Caldwell B. Cladwell (sophomore Adam Elsayed). People do their business on a pay-to-pee basis, and if they don’t comply, they get exiled to a penal colony called Urinetown.</p><p>The cast is split between a ragtag team of poor, angry townspeople and the people in charge. The juxtaposition between the poor protagonists and the powerful antagonists is written as an extreme cliché, and the STC cast successfully conveyed the “heroes vs. villains” trope. However, as a show that routinely breaks the fourth wall and interacts with the audience in a sketch comedic manner, “Urinetown” is far from a mere cliché. Throughout the show, the lines between hero and villain are blurred through heartwarming and heart-wrenching plot twists followed by exaggerated ensemble reactions.</p><p>The intimidating, rule-enforcing Officer Lockstock (senior Leith Conybeare) opened the show with a spine-chilling monologue detailing the town’s unfortunate situation. Lockstock was soon joined by adorable, doe-eyed Little Sally (senior Nadia Filanovsky), who routinely made quips about hydraulics and remarks that broke the fourth wall, such as, “This isn’t a happy musical.” Little Sally was able to bring out the softer side of Officer Lockstock, and the heartwarming rapport between Coneybeare and Filanovsky was one of the highlights of the show.</p><p>The two shined onstage individually, as well. Coneybeare hit every comedic beat and nailed the many complex layers of Lockstock’s character. In “Too Much Exposition,” her gorgeous voice rang through the auditorium. Likewise, Filanovsky thoughtfully portrayed Little Sally’s character arc, leading up to a breathtaking performance for her grand solo in “Tell Her I Love Her,” where her powerful Broadway belt truly packed a punch.</p><p>Another standout performance was senior Jessica Sparacio’s Penelope Pennywise, the rigid, unforgiving woman who runs Public Amenity #9. Sparacio captured both the rough edges and the raw emotion of Pennywise with a mind-blowing attention to detail, from her aggressive physicality to the way she spat on every “p” in “It’s a Privilege to Pee.” Alongside Sparacio’s stellar acting were her unbelievable vocals. A bona fide mezzo belter, Sparacio hit the song’s high notes with ease.</p><p>However, these three were only several of the great performances in “Urinetown.” Elsayed’s portrayal of the malevolent Mr. Cladwell was hilarious and entertaining, and junior Travis Tyson’s rendition of Pennywise’s loveable, fresh-faced assistant Bobby Strong carried some of the show’s most emotional moments.</p><p>Even the smaller characters, who spent most of their time in the ensemble, stole the show for their small moments in the spotlight. Freshman Victoria Wong, as the poor, pregnant Little Becky Two-Shoes, hobbled around stage with an amazing presence. Senior Jenna Bawer was also a natural onstage as Hot Blades Harry, and her energy was a joy to watch.</p><p>While “Urinetown” boasted countless spectacular individual performances, the characters lacked cohesiveness as an ensemble. It often felt as if the actors were basking in the spotlight when they should have been reacting to each other, especially during moments of dialogue. As such, certain relationships that are pivotal to the “Urinetown” plot were underdeveloped, a particular example being the romantic relationship between Bobby Strong and Hope Cladwell (senior Lillian Carver). While both Tyson and Carver were evidently talented actors, they lacked chemistry as a couple.</p><p>For the most part, the show’s ensemble didn’t have this problem. However, some of the smaller characters singing alongside the ensemble were mic’d while the rest of the ensemble wasn’t, and this ruined the sound balance in several songs. “Urinetown,” like many musical comedies, is somewhat of an ensemble-driven show, and the wealth of energy and talent in the ensemble’s songs and dances is a large part of what made this such a successful production.</p><p>Another particularly impressive element of the show was the creativity and attention to detail in the use of props. From toilet plungers to toilet paper, many common household items were used for things other than their intended purposes.</p><p>The layout of papers and cash-filled suitcases on Mr. Cladwell’s desk perfectly brought about the atmosphere of a corporate office, and during the big protest at the end of Act One, the large, messily constructed picket sign reading “FREE THE PEEPL” encapsulated the unique humor of the show. The lighting, costume choices, and the insanely talented band were also artful and professional, contributing to the unparalleled immaculacy of this production.</p><p>The show closed with an uplifting, bluesy performance of “I See A River,” where Carver’s fluid vocals and warm timbre shined. The beautiful music was paired with a classic, corny epilogue narration of what happened to the characters after the story ended. The epilogue was delivered in a wonderfully cringy manner, reminding the audience that “Urinetown” is an emotional rollercoaster of pure satire—a difficult musical to nail, but one that, for the most part, STC successfully did.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:36:37.221716	18	1	A review of the STC’s 2017 spring comedy/musical, Urinetown.
157	﻿2016-2017 Year in Review	2016-2017-year-in-review	<p>Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. We came into Stuyvesant last September, saved from the derelict mindlessness and reckless idleness of the dreaded summer. Now in June, we are forced to once again contend with the onerous summer, but with a new collection of SAT prep books to accompany us.</p><p>Back in the beginning of the year, Harambe was still a thing, and Pokémon Go made us actually exercise for once. Over the summer, two swanky nominating conventions were held to nominate two insanely popular candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p><p>Everyone who actually came to the Republican National Committee was pleased, and the entire convention was notably undisturbed. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake insisted that “mowing his lawn” would take precedence over a political caucus that happens once every four years, and the Kasich- and Cruz-friendly delegations were more than happy to take their seats in the back corners of the convention hall.</p><p>Similarly, at the Democratic National Convention, the talk of the town was former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s positive remarks on Bernie Sanders. These remarks were so enthusiastic that Schultz stepped down as DNC chair to lead the #Bernie2020 movement.</p><p>Enough about summer—let’s go relive some good memories with the first day of school. Coming into school the first time in two months, students were seen kissing the scanning machines, kneeling in front of the portrait of Peter Stuyvesant, and rolling around with glee on the pristine half-floor.</p><p>Freshmen were more than delighted to be at Stuyvesant—the school that many have drooled over for 14 years (actually, 15 years counting the time in the womb). Many of them patted themselves on the back while they failed their biology tests and pulled their first all-nighters—just simply proud of the privilege of travelling two hours to and from school.</p><p>Meanwhile, upperclassmen put college on the back of their minds as they began their immersive academic engagement. They signed up for APs, got screwed over by programming, worked for leadership credentials in extracurriculars, and went sleepless for nights on end for self-enrichment. “Yes, the ‘I Created This Club To Look Good For College’ is completely legit,” senior Laszlo Sandler claimed.</p><p>Speaking of Sandler, the U.S. got its very own joke-of-a-president on Election Day—imagine…the entire country was jealous of us! With Trump’s election, many of us were left more shell-shocked than when the MTA decided to cease all service to Manhattan. There was some solace in Clinton’s popular vote count, but just like how everyone on the packed platform is fumingly angry at the MTA, there was no strength in numbers.</p><p>We could go on about Trump, but it’s probably better to lie low before he roots us out. If The Spectator maintained a Twitter presence, we would probably get lambasted by the president, a position that formerly entailed being the leader of the free world. That battle probably wouldn’t end well for us. Sometimes, we actually do let Alternative Facts pass through as News, such as when we announced that programming would be streamlined last semester—of course not! Though, we don’t think we’ve published any covfefe just yet.</p><p>Some underclassmen might have called our SING! coverage covfefe. There’s a lot to commend Soph-Frosh on, such as their brilliant job on the poop-inspired costumes and their innovative plot that in no way resembled 53929 other teenage trilogies.

158	﻿Programming Office: Why?	programming-office-why	<p>With AP and elective selections finalized, it has become clear that the programming office has prioritized freshmen this year in assigning APs. Feeling cheated, many upperclassmen have begun congregating outside the programming office in protest, forming longer lines than those outside the library after the warning bell rings.</p><p>“I don’t even understand why the juniors are being so annoying!” freshman Sudat Khan exclaimed. “They’re pretty much going to die from senioritis anyway. They’re obviously not vying for these AP courses to quench their intellectual curiosity nor test the limits of human knowledge.”</p><p>Khan proceeded to flip through his AP Honors Advanced Multivariable Calc BCD textbook, which he plans to take next year alongside AP Physics Z and AP Physical Education.</p><p>Originally, programming used a nine-digit number generator—the OSIS closest to the generated number gets into the AP until all the spots are filled up. However, if the student’s OSIS contains the “unlucky number of the year,” that student is taken off the list. Moreover, if the student could not remember and recite his or her OSIS number on-the-spot in under five seconds, she would be removed.</p><p>Now, students will be assigned APs based on the number of AP prep books that they bought from the student store. Even if the student hasn’t taken the course yet, not buying that extra prep book might be the one thing stopping him or her from getting into that AP course he or she has wanted to take for three years.</p><p>Just to spice things up, programming has a different process for electives. First, programming office members filter out all of the grades of the students who applied. Each semester, they choose a different range. Last semester, only students with an 80.372-87.661 average in second term freshman biology could have applied for genetics with Dr. Nedwidek-Moore. Besides that, it’s a first-come, first-served basis, starting at precisely 12:23:41 a.m. on the night of JProm. If one student submitted his or her form a millisecond before another student, then he or she would get the class.</p><p>With these restrictions, upperclassmen have found that they have a higher chance of winning the lottery than getting into oversubscribed electives such as Forensics. “Winning the lottery was my safety if I didn’t get into Orgo,” junior Ved Patel mourned.</p><p>However, some juniors weren’t fortunate enough to even win the lottery. “What will I possibly do with a lunch period?” junior Daniel Ju grumbled. “My guy, I’m going to get so bored of being able to sleep for more than three hours.”</p><p>Now, starting fall semester of next year, there will be new APs and electives exclusively for juniors. Among a few of them are: “How to Get Into College,” “I Created This Elective to Look Good For College,” and “I Have Not Yet Succumbed to Senioritis.”</p><p>Some of these courses will be taught by former Principal Jie Zheng, who is coming back to Stuyvesant to help students apply for her for-profit military academy upstate. There, they’ll finally be able to take that one AP that Stuyvesant does not offer: AP Poaching.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:38:53.989553	5	1	The underclassmen are being given priority when choosing electives and APs, compared to upperclassmen.

He was panicking because there were less than six hours before the exam, and he had not so much as set his eyes on the first page of the Barron's book.</p><p>His palms were sweaty, his knees were weak, and his arms were heavy. He was gorging on a pint of chocolate ice cream and silently weeping. Throughout this ordeal, he took the time to ponder whether attending college was even necessary.</p><p>Even in his over-the-top emotional state, he was able to multitask like the classic Stuyvesant student: simultaneously looking through his Facebook feed and wiping the endless stream of snot on his face.</p><p>After a bit of scrolling, he saw a new video on the trending tab. Not having anything else to do, besides a bit of online shopping to add to his fidget spinner and male romper collection, he decided to click on the link. In an instant, he was directed to a video by Bill Wurtz titled “history of the entire world, i guess.”</p><p>He felt a flush of relief; Wurtz must have made this video just for the AP World exam. Immediately, he played the video. Sitting through roughly 19 minutes of world history, the video filled his puny mind with enough knowledge for the test. He was sure of it.</p><p>During the exam the next day, he walked in calm and ready. As he quickly advanced through the test, he came upon a tough question: “What came to Buddha’s mind after sitting under a tree for a week?” A lightbulb literally formed above his head to the dismay of many students around him. The answer was obvious: “you could make a religion out of this.” He violently bubbled in that choice, almost ripping the paper and creating a hole as big as the one in his soul.</p><p>He came out of the test feeling confident that he did well. Weeks went by, and soon enough, school was out. As he returned to his dark bedroom to sign up for his 15th AP, he received a notification on his phone saying that AP scores came out. He rushed to check his score, as this would decide whether or not his parents would disown him. To his great delight, he “copped” a five.</p><p>The news that evening reported amazing AP World History exam scores across the country: the highest scores that the College Board had seen in years. It was announced that Wurtz’s video was the source of this success. He had helped write the test and took it upon himself to enlighten the desperate sophomores who needed a last-minute overview of the curriculum.</p><p>The College Board has expressed great delight in Wurtz's teaching abilities, deeming him the “Less-of-a-dub Khan Academy.”</p><p>Wurtz has even recently announced that he will be working on a separate video, exclusively for AP United States History. This announcement was received with a great deal of support and encouragement, yet many complain that they wish Wurtz decided to make it sooner.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:40:03.183382	5	1	A hopeless sophomore doomed to fail his AP World History exam is enlightened with Bill Wurtz’s immense knowledge and aces it, subsequently resulting in very high scores across the country.
163	﻿The Hitmen End the Season With New Memories	the-hitmen-end-the-season-with-new-memories	<p>The Stuyvesant Hitmen’s second doubles team lobbed the ball over their Bronx Science opponents, who proceeded to smash an overhead at the Hitmen. Senior and co-captain Julian Neuman reacted quickly, hitting a tweener, a between-the-legs shot, for a winner past his opponents. The substitutes and spectators cheered for Stuyvesant as Neuman and senior and co-captain Zachary Wakefield high-fived to celebrate the point. They would go on to lose the match 8-2, but still managed to maintain a high level of energy throughout.</p><p>Tweener winners were not uncommon in Neuman’s matches this season. “[Neuman’s] nickname on the team is J-Tweener due to his prodigious skill for hitting tweeners,” Wakefield said. Neuman was an important asset to the Hitmen this year, bringing with him a 4-2 regular season record in doubles.</p><p>The Hitmen went 7-3 this season, losing only to the schools ranked higher than them in the Bronx/Manhattan A3 League: Beacon and Bronx Science. Their strong finish in the regular season helped them earn the seventh seed in the playoffs. In their first playoff match, they played against New Dorp, and they were able to defeat the school in a swift 5-0 win. The victory propelled the team into quarterfinals.</p><p>The quarterfinals match for the Hitmen was on Friday, May 26th against Bronx Science. Though the rivalry between the two schools had been fierce during the regular season, the Wolverines prevailed easily over the Hitmen, winning with a score of 5-0. At their first meeting this year, the Hitmen had defeated the Wolverines, and the early win had boosted the confidence level of the team. During the playoff game, some of the Hitmen had been expecting a result similar to their first encounter with the Wolverines.  “[The] match was very disappointing; we all went in very optimistically,” Wakefield said. However, the Hitmen did not go down without a fight, as every match had an air of tension around it.</p><p>The first singles match between junior Nicholas Pustilnik and Bronx Science’s Jonah Jurick was particularly competitive. Pustilnik had a 7-2 record from the regular season, while Jurick was just 4-2. Each player held his own service game until Jurick was up 5-4, and managed to break Pustilnik’s serve and rhythm to win the match at 8-4.</p><p>Though the early loss in playoffs was disappointing, the season was very successful for the Hitmen, both against previous rivals and as a team. Many of the seniors held a deep sense of gratitude toward both their coaches and teammates. “I love my team and coach to death and feel very sad that I have to leave this year,” Wakefield said.</p><p>Moving forward, the graduation of seniors on the team this year will be detrimental to the Hitmen’s starting lineup. In order to fill these voids, more of the sophomores and freshmen must step up. “Albert Wan, Robin Han, and Nick Chan were key components of the team and will continue to be for the foreseeable future,” Neuman said. With the potential of these up-and-coming Hitmen, the team will be more successful in the future seasons and playoffs. “I’m hopeful next year the team could compete for championships,” Neuman said.</p><p>“Being a part of Stuy tennis for four years has been a great experience, in particular, our coach, Marv Autry, is a real inspiration to everyone on the team,” said Neuman when asked about the highlights of this season. Overall, the Hitmen are more than satisfied with their performance this year, as players focused more on enjoying the teamwork of the game alongside its competitiveness.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:46:23.168485	24	1	The Hitmen have thrived throughout the season and lost in the quarterfinals of playoffs, but have improved their teamwork along the way.
183	﻿Controversy and Conversations Around the Whitney’s Biennial	controversy-and-conversations-around-the-whitney-s-biennial	<p>Shock. Controversy. Conversations.</p><p>The Whitney Museum of American Art’s latest exhibition, “Whitney Biennial,” can be summed up in just three words, and while they can be used to describe just about any contemporary art show, the biennial makes the ideas conveyed by these words literal. The show, put together every two years, generally spotlights the works of younger, more contemporary artists, with the first biennial occurring in 1973.</p><p>This year, the Whitney targets the biggest issues America faces today—from climate change to wealth inequality to racial tensions—all while showcasing newfound intersections between art and technology, as well as art and activism. The ultimate theme seems to be that nothing is sugarcoated. Every problem is real. Every face is real. It’s time to face reality.</p><p>The controversy of “Open Casket” by Dana Schutz, compared to the praise of “THE TIMES THAY AINT A CHANGING, FAST ENOUGH!” by Henry Taylor speaks volumes. Though similar in subject matter, the two have been received in very different manners.</p><p>“Open Casket” is based on photographs of Emmett Till, who was brutally murdered by two white men, in his coffin in 1955. The photographs were released because his mother wanted to let the world know what had happened to her son. Schutz, as a white painter, is seen as inappropriately appropriating such subject matter, though she does use interesting techniques to represent Till’s disfigured face on a canvas, such as raising the surface on various sections to make the painting three-dimensional. The day after the opening of the biennial, protesters (many of whom are artists) wearing shirts stating “Black Death Spectacle” began standing in front of the piece to block it from being viewed.</p><p>Taylor, a black artist, depicts the shooting of Philando Castile by a police officer in “THE TIMES…” As a color block piece, the painting immediately draws attention, with deep yellow windows contrasting with the dark blue and green car in which Castile lays lifeless, one eye open with specks of paint, not blood, splattered across his white shirt. Interestingly, the mustard yellow windows are like blocks of paint, keeping all that is happening outside the car out of view; only the police officer’s gun in one window and a sliver of the sky in the corner of another window are featured. The Whitney’s mission of highlighting artists that represent a new generation is evident in this particular work, as Taylor’s source was the Facebook live video taken by Castile’s girlfriend. Taylor transforms the event into a visual symbol, using paint to convey the overwhelming chaos and feelings of Castile in the video.</p><p>In the next room, the Whitney explores a related topic in another medium: virtual reality. Viewers are provided a trigger warning and must be over 17 to watch. They are given headphones and virtual-reality goggle sets, are told to grip the railing below, and are closely supervised by staff. The approximately two-minute video, titled “Real Violence,” is of a white man, the artist, Jordan Wolfson, taking a baseball bat and horrifically pounding another white man before dragging the man and graphically kicking his face in. Blood is everywhere, but despite it being set in the bustling city, no one pays attention. However, the viewer, trapped by the goggles and headphones, has no way of ignoring the horrific scene. The video ends as the sound of the man singing Hebrew blessings ends, with the camera shifting unsteadily, like it was all a dream.</p><p>Created with a doll to produce the most realistic content, Wolfson’s work speaks to the charged atmosphere of America today, and because it does not deal with race or social class, it brings light to the bigger problem of violence in America. It shocks and angers viewers who aren’t sure what to expect before becoming suddenly immersed in the scene. The curators’ choice to place the work so closely to the ones dealing with racial tensions, however, gives each piece greater context.</p><p>While the biennial deals greatly with the problems of America today, other works bring more positive messages. Musician Kamasi Washington’s piece, “Harmony of Difference,” in particular, uses film and music to express precisely the opposite, or perhaps a solution, to the problems of America presented by the rest of the show. The work is split into five parts: “Desire,” “Humility,” “Knowledge,” “Perspective,” and “Integrity.” Each part features cuts of all different walks of life interrupted by images of a galaxy, as soothing jazz music builds to become richer and more exciting. The piece does not include the chaos that others in the show are portraying, but instead purposefully focuses on the idea of everyone living in harmony.</p><p>Somehow, all the works curated for the biennial are incredibly topical, though many were chosen before the 2016 presidential election even began, and that fact only proves the necessity of a show that can garner huge audiences while pinpointing the various problems that continue to plague America. The sense of urgency the Whitney Biennial brings, along with the attention generated by its controversies, only proves the effectiveness of activism in art, and it prompts us, as viewers, to wonder what our roles are in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>The “Whitney Biennial” will be on view until June 11, 2017.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:37:42.937631	4	1	
244	﻿Spartans Bid Farewell to A Successful Season	spartans-bid-farewell-to-a-successful-season	<p>The Spartans, Stuyvesant’s boys’ bowling team, went into the season with high expectations. They lived up to them during the regular season, sweeping all 12 of their division games and making it to the playoffs as a 19th overall seed by PSAL, the highest they have ever been.</p><p>The Spartans have constantly risen higher in the ranks, going further into the playoffs compared to previous years. Last year, they were ranked 31st, but lost to Tottenville High School from Staten Island. This year, they had an easier path to the playoffs with their 19th seed. However, they got a bye in the first round of the playoffs. Ultimately, the Spartans’ season culminated in a do-or-die game against Fort Hamilton High School during the second round of the playoffs on November 8, 2017.</p><p>From the get-go, the Spartans were thrown off by the lane conditions. The A team players, many of whom have big hook shots, found their hooks difficult to control; the ball  curved too early and did not hit the pocket because there was not enough grease applied to the lane before the game.The A team lost 539-586.</p><p>However, the B team helped the Spartans bounce back, winning 549-519. Junior LinPeng Chen and senior Jihui Xue led the effort, bowling 145 and 158, respectively. Since their styles are more conventional (straighter throws), they were less affected by the lane conditions. It all came down to the C team, in which Coach Di Wu stacked his four seniors. “It was already pre-determined. We were going to go down with our senior players,” Wu said. Fort Hamilton got an early lead, as their first two players bested senior and co-captain James Lee and Xue. “I wasn't used to the lane when we played the C game. I did badly during the first five frames and just got discouraged,” Xue said.</p><p>Fort Hamilton’s Sebastian Bekkaoui then bowled an incredible 203, greatly extending their lead . Though put in a tough spot, senior Wesley Chen delivered and came extremely close to match with a 191. Senior Yong Fei Zheng then won his match, but unfortunately, his score was not high enough to boost the Spartans for the win. In a suspenseful nail-biter, the Spartans lost 594-626.</p><p>“Losing in the second round was quite the tragedy,” Lee said. The C team made a true comeback possible, but came short by 32 pins. As a coach, Wu was very proud to see his team really get into the game and battle to the very end. The players kept their mentalities strong and were able to adjust to the lane conditions. Wesley Chen, for example, switched from his custom ball to the bowling alley’s plastic one and tweaked the style on his hook. As a result, he bowled a 191 in the C game compared to his 139 in the A game.</p><p>Leading up to the playoffs, the Spartans’ season had been filled with ups and downs. They faced the High School of Art and Design on October 12, 2017. Though the A and B teams won their respective matches and clinched the game (best of three), they won with relatively low pin count totals. Neither the A nor B team broke a 500 total, bowling a 473 and 439, respectively. The Spartans demolished Beacon High School on October 17, 2017; Lee led things off by bowling a 175, and the rest of the A team followed. They won by an impressive total of 601-459, and the B team delivered as well, winning 501 - 390.</p><p>However, the Spartans took a dip during a two-game series against the High School of Fashion Industries on October 18 and 19, 2017. A team with many inexperienced players, Fashion Industries did not provide much competition for the Spartans; no player bowled above 100 in either game. The Spartans won, but the majority of the players bowled in the low 100’s, resulting in totals in the low 500’s rather than their usual mid/high 500 totals in the absence of contest. The Spartans’ pin count took a hit and slid in the rankings as a result. “They kind of blur it out when there is no competition. They get stronger when their opponents are stronger,” Wu said. This was a primary example of the Spartans bowling below their full capability despite winning every game. Another difficulty for the Spartans was their composure, which further affected their performances. “Their [players’] mental games got the best of them; my captains hit a wall and lost their confidence,” Wu said. “[When] many players miss a throw or leave a pin, their immediate reaction often carries through to their following throw.”</p><p>As a coach, it was been crucial for Wu to keep his team both focused and relaxed during game situations. No matter how much the team struggled, the Spartans were always on the same page regarding their playoff aspirations. However, these expectations set by themselves and Wu have added pressure, affecting their play. “It's been a tougher-than-expected road,” Wu said. “Our team’s biggest issue was that we were inconsistent.”</p><p>Despite the inconsistencies and the early playoff exit, the Spartans still have a lot to look forward to for next year. Over the winter off-season, they will continue to stay sharp during their weekly practices at Whitestone Lanes in Queens. While bowling, the same emphasis will be placed on players closing their frames by picking up spares despite the number of pins left after the first throw. Wu will also work to make his players’ hooks more controllable so that they can make in-game adjustments and not get thrown off. While the Spartans have yet to build a solid B team with their newer players, they will definitely have a competitive core group for their A team to replace this year’s seniors. Junior LinPeng Chen, sophomore Samuel Fang, and freshman Eric (Jin Won) Kim will carry the torch.</p><p>Wu will say goodbye to the players he has brought up in his four-year coaching career. Xue, Lee, and Zheng have shown heart and dedication to their sport, inspired their teammates, and led the Spartans farther and farther each year. The Spartans have brought a new element to bowling; the captains have become passionate about their game, approaching it with a new level of seriousness and not just as a recreational sport. Their influence and motivation will hopefully continue to guide the Spartans into next year.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:01:18.265998	24	1	The Spartans experienced ups and downs in their undefeated season, and lost in the 2nd round of the playoffs to Fort Hamilton High School.
245	﻿Penguins Capture PSAL Championship	penguins-capture-psal-championship	<p>Freshman Stella Oh dives off her starting block, being the last swimmer in her 200-yard freestyle medley group. The competitors before her have given her a slight lead, and she is halfway across the 25-yard long pool when the last swimmer from the Brooklyn Technical High School medley group springs into the water. Oh darts through the water and maintains her lead over the rival swimmer for 150 yards. On the last lap, Oh begins to slow down and the opposing swimmer hastens her pace. However, Oh out-touches the opposing swimmer by less than 0.4 seconds, giving Stuyvesant’s girls’ swimming team, the Penguins, a huge boost of six points to their total score. The Penguins ultimately triumph over the Brooklyn Technical High School Engineers by a significant margin of 59-42 in the championship meet.</p><p>The Penguins were once again dominant in the Bronx/Manhattan League, finishing the regular season as the top team in the league with a 10-0 record. Additionally, they enjoyed victories against rivals such as Hunter College High School and Bronx Science High School by large margins of 58-41 and 63-39, respectively.</p><p>The team had a new coach this year: physical education teacher Silvana Choy taking over the role of former head coach Peter Bologna as a result of his new position as Athletic Director.</p><p>The Penguins truly believe that Coach Choy has been excellent and has played a major part in their success. “[Coach Choy] definitely benefitted the team a lot by making every practice truly count and was even willing to come in on Saturdays just so that we could get a few more practices in [...] The season has been really great with her, and while I'm sure that the returning girls miss Coach Bologna, we've all opened up to Coach Choy and she's truly become part of the team,” senior and co-captain Luola Chen said.</p><p>Choy was quickly accepted by the swimmers and led the team to yet another undefeated regular season and championship. She attributes much of her success to how the captains helped her transition into her role as coach by instilling discipline into the younger swimmers and making sure they improve with every opportunity. “They organize drylands and lead lanes in practice on a daily basis [and] are solid leaders,” Choy said.</p><p>The other major obstacle the Penguins faced was the fact that there were only five seniors on the team. The results have been quite different, however, with many of the underclassmen on the team emerging as the Penguins’ top swimmers. Sophomore Emma Lee, who was voted MVP of the team as a freshman, played a crucial part in the team’s success. Lee finished first in every race she competed in this year, often lapping opponents. In the championship meet against Brooklyn Technical High School on Tuesday, November 7, Lee performed exceptionally well, finishing first in every event she participated in. This included two individual events (the 50 and 100-yard freestyle) as well as the 200-yard freestyle medley where she had the fastest time in her group. Another rising star was sophomore Arielle Aney who took home first or second place in every event she swam in this year. Aney also performed outstandingly against Brooklyn Technical High School, finishing first in the 200-yard freestyle and having the fastest time in her 400-yard freestyle medley group.</p><p>With many dominant underclassmen swimmers on the team, the Penguins once again had their eyes set on a championship run. Last year, the Penguins advanced to the championship round with a strong victory over Townsend Harris but fell short against Brooklyn Technical High School in the final meet. This year, they once again had a strong showing against Townsend Harris, winning 58-42, and got payback for last year’s loss with a decisive victory over Brooklyn Tech. “It felt great getting such a huge victory over [Brooklyn Technical High School]. We were coming off of an undefeated season last year, so the loss in the championship was really devastating to us. The way we bounced back this year, with a new coach and everything, was amazing, and I have no doubt that we’re capable of another championship next year as well,” junior Sasha Spajic said.</p><p>This need for retribution against Brooklyn Technical High School almost seemed to drive the Penguins to have such dominant performances throughout the year and ultimately capture the title.</p><p>With a returning core of outstanding swimmers as well as an effective coach, there is little reason to believe that the Penguins aren’t capable of defending their championship.“My goals for the team are for the girls to improve their stroke technique and their times. It's not about the results, it's about the process. If we continue to improve, the results will take care of themselves,” Coach Choy said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:01:23.818146	24	1	After another undefeated regular season filled with new challenges, the Penguins capture a PSAL championship over their main rivals Brooklyn Technical High School.
288	﻿The Fastest Food Chains Are Turning Green	the-fastest-food-chains-are-turning-green	<p>In recent years, fast food companies have been trying to change the stigma surrounding their industry. Long known for their unhealthy foods, large trash contributions, huge methane production, and continuous use of resources to raise animals, brands like McDonald’s and Chipotle are making a PR push to give their brands a greener reputation.</p><p>To be more eco-friendly, Starbucks, a chain brand that has set the modern standard for coffee, is using its new $1.00 reusable cups to help reduce paper waste. The incentive is that consumers get 10 cents off of refills if they use the cups, which last about a month. Chipotle sources many of its ingredients locally and buys nearly half of its beans from local farms, which is not only healthier, but also cheaper. Overseas, Sweden’s popular Max Burgers chain includes on its packaging CO2 labels that tell customers how much carbon dioxide was produced to make a certain meal. This urges customers to order more environmentally-friendly foods, including non-beef burgers.</p><p>With these programs, Starbucks has been able to significantly reduce trash hauling costs, Chipotle’s revenues have tripled, allowing the brand to expand exponentially, and Max Burgers’ CO2 labels and largely non-beef menu have added a 16 percent sales increase. For extra profitability, environmentally-friendly products like edible packaging or recyclable paper products increase customer loyalty and provide a good corporate image. Restaurants are also earning money by selling materials to recycling facilities.</p><p>However, despite their attempts to implement or encourage greener practices, the fast food industry's actions have done little to counteract the environmental harm that they continue to cause. These chains are still some of the biggest contributors to climate change and also seem to have an inability to keep up with the growing number of food-conscious consumers. The fast food industry buys billions of pounds of meat from the meat industry, which, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization, is responsible for about 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. These companies’ extensive use of eco-friendly products only helps to sanitize the fact that any increased revenue goes to increasing food production, therefore causing even more pollution.</p><p>The fast food industry can use all the eco-friendly packaging it wants, but its refusal to find healthier and greener alternatives when sourcing its meat far outweighs any attempt to reduce its ecological footprint. In 2014, McDonald’s confirmed that meat from over 100 cows can go into a single burger. Along with the many other fast food chains that share this practice, hundreds of thousands of cows per year are being used in the name of fast food.</p><p>With every cow producing about 242.5 pounds of methane a year, each cow releases 485 pounds of methane in its lifetime. After slaughter, the energy needed to process the meat and get it shipped off, cooked, and consumed adds up to over 71 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year created by the fast food industry alone.</p><p>One reason unhealthy practices are still used may be that they are cheaper than using less harmful products, allowing prices to remain as low as they are. The industry fails to see the positive long-term effects of changing to healthier food alternatives. A lot of money will go into trying to revamp an enterprise that has long been based on unhealthy fast food, but over time, greater public image can come from using better food and can provide exponential growth for companies.</p><p>The biggest factor that may be making companies hesitant to change deeper structural issues, as opposed to providing largely surface-level fixes for public appeal, is the quickly rising cost of fast food. Eating in is becoming more common and the higher prices are also working to offset increased employee wages, contributing to fast food prices that have increased 110 percent in the last 10 years. Competitors are working harder to produce faster and more easily-made food, an extension of the traditional practices of the fast food industry. This leads to additional environmental damage and adds to the destruction that companies have already put in place from years of trying to the make the quickest “ready-to-go” foods by using the cheapest and, coincidentally, unhealthiest ingredients.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s little to convince these companies to stop advancing as quickly as they are. At the rate that the fast food industry requires meat, farmers, most of whom are severely underpaid, have little ability to keep up while also providing non-harmful ingredients for consumers. Not only is it expensive for the meat industry to use less preservatives or more animal-friendly practices, but participants don’t receive much in return for any efforts to be environmentally friendly.</p><p>Much damage has been done, but it doesn’t mean that fast food companies shouldn’t make an effort to change. Instead of buying meat from an industry that is already a target of animal rights activists for its sometimes cruel slaughtering processes, the food industry can turn to providers that use more sustainable techniques. It may be more expensive, but it provides incentive for farmers to try healthier techniques when raising their animals or harvesting their crops. Increased PR and customer loyalty may also be able to persuade companies that sourcing from farms with safer practices is worth the money.</p><p>But doing it for the money shouldn’t be the only reason why the fast food industry is pursuing the green movement. The most direct solutions may come from stricter government regulations. At the moment, those imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service aren’t trying to ensure environmentally friendlier practices. In the meat and food processing industry, most of the focus is on hygiene and preventing the mislabeling of food. The regulations on the fast food industry work to reduce America’s high obesity rates by simply asking restaurants to put nutrition facts on their products. Though these are important to address, organizations like the FDA and World Health Organization need to take into account the problems of pollution and global warming, which are most contributed to by the fast food and meat industries. Using a cleaner production system should be a part of the process for the food business to provide healthier products for consumers.</p><p>If they’re hesitant, fast food giants should look to Max Burgers, which has seen great success since it started making products that are healthier and less damaging to the environment. Though there are many cons to changing their ways, companies should ignore extra costs and look to the benefits that come with making the big leap to a healthier food industry.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 17:46:26.403552	2	1	Fast food companies are trying to be more green, but they need to try harder to offset the mass environmental damage they have caused.
248	﻿Setting New Standards	setting-new-standards	<p>At the beginning of each school year, the most common topic of conversation at Stuyvesant is “Who are your teachers?” This is followed by either a groan at the excruciating months to come or a silent “thank you” to the computer algorithm that granted the student good fortune in the form of an easy 95.</p><p>At Stuyvesant, grades are partial because they depend largely on your teacher and often reflect luck rather than merit. While there are always good and bad teachers, one thing that can be changed is the standardization of the difficulty of classes by assistant principals at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Colleges don’t take the teacher of a class into consideration, nor is it possible to translate teacher difficulty into a numerical curve on the student’s average. Admissions officers can’t keep tabs on every teacher at a school, especially with the tens of thousands of students from hundreds of schools who apply for elite U.S. colleges each year. Since colleges are easily deceived by an unrealistic GPA from an easy course and teacher, and thus might unfairly reject students who simply got the short end of the stick, introducing set, written standards for grading and keeping exam difficulty constant will give colleges a more truthful view of students’ academic achievement.</p><p>Often, students with comparatively harsh graders lack the same confidence of their higher scoring peers. Stuyvesant offers a wealth of advanced classes, but there’s a fine line between a class being difficult yet fair and totally impossible. Classes that are unreasonably difficult can take a toll on student confidence in their academic ability, causing students to do worse on schoolwork and tests.</p><p>A study by Open Colleges indicated that “confidence increases from beginning to end in a course, provided the students perform adequately.” After being repeatedly unsuccessful in a class, there is less incentive to try harder as each attempt appears more and more futile. Sophomore Ilona Khimey stated, “I get very discouraged when a teacher doesn’t reward my effort at all, and when I see friends trying two times less doing 10 points better.”</p><p>Alternatively, the institution of standards maximizes learning, because standards are written by authorities with educational experience who understand what information will help students in the long run.</p><p>Standardization is achievable by keeping exam difficulty constant throughout all classes of a subject and creating Common Core-like guidelines to communicate to students, parents, and staff what students should and should not be learning. The final exam should be built upon these standards to fairly measure the skill of the student and teacher. If many students for a certain teacher score poorly on the final exam, then it is a clear indicator that the teacher should begin shaping his or her curriculum to fit the standards better.</p><p>For instance, if all of a teacher’s students failed the history final, while students with other teachers did well, the scores would reflect more on that specific teacher than his students, creating a system of enforcement. This way, there are no “tough” teachers and no “easy” teachers; everyone stays on the same playing field, learning generally the same material, making college admissions much more fair, program changes less hectic, and giving students an easier time overall.</p><p>This in no way limits a teacher’s creative autonomy in terms of how they want to teach the material. If a teacher’s job is to introduce students to a set curriculum, this should be done regardless of personal teaching style. They’re still able to instruct their classes however they want and add as much information as they deem necessary, just as long as they still teach the required material.</p><p>Making the curriculum clear and consistent for every teacher will also eliminate superfluous information that teachers often throw into their curriculum because of personal preferences, saving time and effort. If the student isn’t learning what the standards say he or she should be learning, it’s easy for the teacher to be alerted, because standards are set in stone.</p><p>Right now, success in Stuyvesant can’t be attributed to solely intelligence. Luck is arguably just as important in maintaining a high GPA. While conflating natural abilities with the numbers on our transcript is a mistake most students make, the stress of maintaining good grades makes it hard to evaluate ourselves otherwise. Standardizing curriculums would bridge the gap between fairness and the ability to succeed, leveling the playing field once and for all.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-01 20:29:49.242632	2	1	After being repeatedly unsuccessful in a class, there’s less incentive to try harder as each attempt seems more and more futile.
162	﻿States Semifinals Prove Ultimate	states-semifinals-prove-ultimate	<p>“We never really believed that we could lose, and then we did,” senior Ely Sandine said. As co-captain of Stuyvesant’s boys’ ultimate frisbee team, the Sticky Fingers, Sandine was as devastated as anyone after the team’s semifinals exit in the State Championship. After winning four games, Stuyvesant faced Ethical Culture Fieldston School and played intensely in its last chance of making it to the finals.</p><p>After a rocky season and a postseason battle, the loss did not come easily to the team, which is used to repeated success. “We were coming off of three consecutive state championships, and as a result, we were expected to win this year,” Sandine said. The bar was set high for the Sticky Fingers, and as Sandine expressed, the boys simply could not perform under this pressure.</p><p>The year started off with the Youth Ultimate League of Arlington (YULA) tournament, which gathered the top teams from around the East Coast. Stuyvesant only managed to tally one win during the entire weekend, which, though disappointing, did not come as a complete surprise given the seriously tough competition. In Stuyvesant’s first match, it faced Yorktown High School—which was recently ranked 24th in the nation by the reputable High School Power Rankings—and ended the first half ahead of Yorktown 7-6. The Sticky Fingers ended up losing that match, but held their own against an elite squad.</p><p>A week later, Stuyvesant was set to play The Brooklyn Latin School. Despite the defeats in the YULA outing, the Sticky Fingers were confident, and perhaps unwisely played as if the game was a guaranteed victory. “We expected to win the game easily, and as a result played carelessly,” Sandine said. The team lacked sound fundamentals, turning over the disc on short passes and letting these small mistakes get to their heads.</p><p>This first upset set the tone for the rest of the season, and it seemed the Sticky Fingers had lost the dominance that previously defined them. After more ups and downs, Stuyvesant prepared for the City Championship that was on the near horizon. In a close semifinals showdown, the Sticky Fingers crawled to a one point victory over Fieldston. The win seemed to come as a surprise, but it earned them a shot at the City title nonetheless. “[We had] a lot of lucky plays, and we did not play our best,” senior Benjamin Zhang said.</p><p>Due to play Bard High School in the finals, Stuyvesant came mentally prepared and brought the intensity up a notch. The stronger gameplay was met with Bard’s strong lineup, and though the Sticky Fingers were able to keep it close, once Bard got ahead of them, they simply could not catch up. This loss was Stuyvesant’s third against Bard, after playing them twice during the season and falling short by one point both times.</p><p>By the time the State Championship arrived, the Sticky Fingers were motivated to continue the legacy that had been left by three graduating classes and take the title. Stuyvesant cruised by the first four games, beating Mamaroneck High School 13-1, New Rochelle High School 13-1, Brooklyn Latin 13-5, and Bronx High School of Science 13-5. After their quarterfinals victory over Bronx Science, the Sticky Fingers had less than an hour until they played Fieldston in the semifinals. Despite a strong first four games, semifinals proved to be a turning point in the tournament. “That's when everything went south,” Zhang said.</p><p>Fieldston took the first half 7-0, shutting down any signs of Stuyvesant offense. Additionally, the Sticky Fingers’ defense relented, allowing the opposition to score. “We weren’t putting enough pressure on them after we gave up the disc,” Sandine said. In the second half, the Sticky Fingers were clinging to any hope of staying in the game. In their desperation, they scored five points before eventually succumbing to Fieldston.</p><p>Though the season’s end was crushing, some looked back on the year with satisfaction. Senior Jacob Grunebaum highlighted the great pressure that is put on the frisbee team. He explained that the expectation to win is a burden that affects the team’s game and takes away from focusing on the basics. Grunebaum was content with the team’s performance, and believes it should be proud of what it accomplished. “I think we achieved a very high level of playing and proved that we are a very good team, just that consistency ultimately was our greatest problem,” he said.</p><p>Though the Sticky Fingers will lose many strong players next year, they will continue to work hard for the title, learning from the mistakes made this year and keeping their heads up. This loss could humble Stuyvesant and change the dynamic next season. “It has been a while since we played as the underdogs,” Sandine said.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:44:29.633456	24	1	Stuyvesant’s boys’ ultimate frisbee team laments semifinals loss at States as a tough season ends a three-year streak of being state champions.
164	﻿Another Victorious Season for the Greyducks	another-victorious-season-for-the-greyducks	<p>“With Stuy having such a rigorous curriculum, I have to admit it gets difficult at times balancing a demanding sport like track, where we are in season for the whole year. I am impressed with how far this talented group of girls has come.”  —Lucia Liu, senior and co-captain</p><p>“Our Race Walk is always a strong event, and we got as many points as we could.” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>“The difference between fourth and seventh places were very small. The competition was very close and we could have been fourth or seventh.” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>“The captains were very supportive of their teammates” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>“Throughout the whole season, the girls performed really well and were striving for their personal best… I am hopeful that the Greyducks will place on the podium in all three seasons [next year].” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>--article starts here--</p><p>With summer around the corner, the girls’ outdoor track team finished another stellar season. The Greyducks started the season with two goals: to become back-to-back Manhattan borough champions, and to finish on the podium at the City Championships. With a strong performance in the field events, the girls accomplished their first goal, coming in first place in the Manhattan Borough Championship on May 21. But despite stellar individual performances at City Championships a week later on May 28, the Greyducks came in seventh place and could not reach the podium.</p><p>While it is true that the Greyducks didn’t come in the top three, it is also important to note that the difference in points between places is minimal. For example, a seventh place and a fourth place finish are less than ten points apart, as Dr. Markova, the coach of the girls’ team pointed out. “The difference between fourth and seventh places were very small. The competition was very close and we could have been fourth or seventh.”</p><p>Starting from their first meet on March 25, the girls’ track team had a very successful season. Though it started out slow, it quickly picked up: they dominated the 1500-meter racewalk at the Bob Zifchak Classic Meet on April 30, and the Spring Series meets on March 29, April 19, and May 2, largely due to sophomores Kayla Lew, Bernice Chen, and Jeanette Cheung, freshman Tina Zheng, and junior Joyce Wu. With such a strong team, even without the graduating seniors, next year is looking bright.</p><p>At the Mayor’s Cup on April 8, senior and star athlete Zovinar Khrimian came in first place in the 1500 meter race (5:06.81). The sophomore 4x800-meter relay team, composed of Clara Mohri, Tiffany Zhong, Jocelyn Tang, and Vivian Cribb placed an outstanding second place in the sophomore division. In addition, the freshman 4x800-meter relay team, which consisted of Doris Chen, Tiffany Cao, Jing Su, and Ester Suleymanov, placed fourth in the freshman division.</p><p>At the Manhattan Borough Championship on May 21, the Greyducks dominated the field events. At the start of the season, senior and co-captain Lucia Liu had hoped to strengthen the Greyducks’ performance in field events—which ended up being one of the reasons that the team performed so well. For example, junior Daria Shifrina came in first in both the high jump and triple jump, with a height of four feet, six inches and a distance of 32-01.50, respectively. Shifrina also came in third in the long jump, with a distance of 14 feet and seven inches. The Greyducks also dominated the pole vault with outstanding individual performances, with Liu taking first place, junior Venus Nnadi coming in second, and freshman Zoe Zakrzewska coming in fourth.</p><p>Senior Zovinar Khrimian and sophomore Clara Mohri also did extremely well in the track events. Mohri came in first in the 3000-meter race and third in the 1500-meter race. Khrimian came in second in both the 3000-meter race and the 1500-meter race.</p><p>All of this led up to the City Championships event at Icahn Stadium on Randall’s Island on Sunday, May 28. In the field events, Nnadi and Liu tied for 7th place in the pole vault with seven and a half feet. In the relay events, the 4x800 team, consisting of senior Catriona Breen, Khrimian, Mohri, and Cribb, came in third place just behind the Staten Island Tech team—an incredible accomplishment for the Greyducks. Khrimian said, “Everyone was in good spirits, especially at the end when the 4x800 [meter relay team] came in third in the city.”</p><p>The Greyducks also did well in the individual running events at the City Championships. Mohri came in fourth in the 3000 meter run with an impressive time of 10 minutes and 47.49 seconds, (10:47.49), and Khrimian also came in fourth in the 1500 meter run with a time of four minutes and 58.09 seconds (4:58.09).</p><p>Racewalking has always been a strong event for the Greyducks, and it was no different at the City Championships, where the Greyducks dominated the 1500 meter walk. Juniors Ziqi Guo and Joyce Wu also came in first and second places, respectively, with times of seven minutes and 31.41 seconds (7:31.41) and seven minutes and 35.28 seconds (7:35.28), respectively. Guo will be attending Nationals for a second time. As Dr. Markova said, “Our racewalk is always a strong event and we got as many points as we could.”</p><p>The highlight of the City Championships on May 28, however, was the fact that Stuyvesant’s own senior and co-captain Sharon Hu was honored as the winner of the PSAL 2017 Track & Field Scholar-Athlete Scholarship Award, which honors students’ outstanding achievements in the classroom, in the community and on the field. Hu was nominated by Dr. Markova as an athlete who demonstrated a commitment to excel in these areas. As the winner, Hu received an incredible $2,500 scholarship award for college.</p><p>The Greyducks’ accomplishments are no small feat. Unlike many other sports, most members of them team not only run on the outdoor track team, but also run cross country and indoor track, along with having to juggle the rigors of Stuyvesant with the demands of their daily practice throughout the school year. Even so, the Greyducks have again emerged as a force, and they have much to celebrate. As co-captain Liu aptly said, “With Stuy having such a rigorous curriculum, I have to admit it gets difficult at times balancing a demanding sport like track, where we are in season for the whole year. I am impressed with how far this talented group of girls has come.” Dr. Markova echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that “the captains were very supportive of their teammates,” and that “throughout the whole season, the girls performed really well and were striving for their personal best,” she said. “I am hopeful that the Greyducks will place on the podium in all three seasons [next year].”</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:48:17.776697	24	1	“With Stuy having such a rigorous curriculum, I have to admit it gets difficult at times balancing a demanding sport like track, where we are...
165	﻿Greyducks Win 18th Consecutive Borough’s Championship	greyducks-win-18th-consecutive-borough-s-championship	<p>When the Greyducks, Stuyvesant’s boys’ track team, set out on this year’s outdoor track season, they were aiming for another Borough Championship. After a long and arduous season, the team succeeded, winning for the 18th consecutive year. It was not easy, as recently, Stuyvesant has faced fierce opposition from schools such as Hunter and the High School of Math Science and Engineering. However, the team was able to dominate once again.</p><p>Sprinters Sam Jung, Eric Cao, and Alex Schevshenko each placed first in their respective events. Schevshenko also set a school record in his first place 100-meter run with a time of 11.11 seconds. The team also came in first in two of its relays, the 4x100-meter relay and the 4x400-meter relay. The distance runners also triumphed with seniors and co-captains Greg Dudick and Kiyan Tavangar finishing first in the 3200-meter run and the 800-meter run respectively.</p><p>One reason for this major victory was the team’s physical preparation. Throughout the year, the team held indoor and outdoor workouts designed to challenge everyone’s physical and mental limits. It was here the Greyducks learned how to succeed. Senior and co-captain Noah Fichter said, “I think ultimately it comes down to the fact that our workouts are incredibly difficult, but everyone does them, and everyone does them with 100 percent of their energy.” In addition, Tavangar said, “Barely anyone has been missing practices, and everyone has been setting personal bests.” This combination of attendance and effort fueled yet another championship.</p><p>Besides preparation throughout the year, much of their success can be attributed to game day planning and strategy. “We spent hours planning out who to put in each event to score as many points as possible and block as many points as possible,” Fichter said. Similarly, Tavangar said, “Preparation always starts the night before, making sure we eat well and get a solid amount of sleep.” While many observers may think that the Greyducks only succeed because they happen to have the most athletic team, much more mental preparation goes on before each meet than meets the eye.</p><p>With all of these positives leading to their success, Stuyvesant has overcome a few setbacks this season in order to once again be champions of the borough. Numerous events have been rained out this season. This has given Stuyvesant’s runners less practice in competitive situations. In addition, the Greyducks added Coach Mankit Wong to the team, who has less experience than their previous coach, Coach Jeffrey Teta. However, Wong quickly became adjusted to the new sport and was a very effective coach. To help with this process, Teta still volunteered his time to help the runners during practices and games. Together, the two coaches proved to be an effective duo this season and led the team to victory.</p><p>At the end of the year, the Greyducks will lose their seniors, many of whom are vital members and act as leaders of the team. However, for the remaining members, Fichter said, “They certainly have the potential to take the team further than we have gone in past years, but they’re going to have to make adjustments.” When asked about who the team will rely on for next year, Tavangar acknowledged juniors Matt Fairbanks, Minhein Htet, Jesse Sit, Alex Schevchenko and Thomas Thread will need to step up. If the Greyducks continue their thorough preparation for their events and can execute on gameday, it is only a matter of time before we see them back on the podium at the Manhattan Borough Championships.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:50:38.101849	24	1	The Greyducks won Borough’s, again.

In the first round, the Renegades defeated Curtis High School, despite having lost to them in last year’s postseason. Though off to a hot start at beginning of the year, the team struggled towards the end of the season and was unable to maintain its energy in the playoffs.</p><p>This lack of energy was apparent in the their loss to Construction; the team failed to ignite its offense which had been so explosive earlier in the season. Over the span of three games from late April to May, the team scored 56 runs. However, in the last four games of the season, the Renegades only put up nine runs, indicative of a decline in the offense.</p><p>Junior and co-captain Frankie Michielli attributed the lack of offensive productivity to the increase in tough competition. “[At] the end of the season, we definitely faced some tougher teams that gave us more competition than before,” she said. The last two games of the Renegades’ regular season were losses against the top two teams in their league, and after beating Stuyvesant, Construction advanced to the championship against Port Richmond High School.</p><p>During these games, the Renegades struggled against some of the top pitchers in the city, and their inability to perform well against fast pitching was capitalized on by their opponents. Junior and fellow co-captain Charlotte Ruhl agreed that for next year, the team will need to work on hitting against more skilled pitchers—the pitchers who not only throw hard, but work in three or four different pitch types.</p><p>One of the major issues the Renegades faced throughout the entire season was their defense. In the team's 12-2 loss to Manhattan Center, six of the 12 runs scored against the Renegades were on errors. “It was contagious; one error led to another and then another,” coach Vincent Miller said. Though they struggled early in the season, the Renegades worked to fix this and saw improvements. “Our defense got so so much stronger towards the end of the season,” Ruhl said.</p><p>The Peglegs were able to excel in their division this year because of their stacked lineup. Ruhl was one of the greatest contributors, leading the division in RBIs (34), standing second in runs (27), and fourth in home runs (5). Sophomore Talia Kirshenbaum brought a charge to the offense, hitting six home runs throughout the season despite an injury that limited her at the end of the season. In games where other aspects of play fell short, the offense saved the Renegades. “We had a bunch of come-from-behind wins because of our offense, ” Miller said.</p><p>In games where offense struggled for the Renegades, their pitching limited other teams and helped secure victories. In the Renegades’ first-round victory over the Curtis High School Warriors, Stuyvesant only managed to score three runs but Michielli held the Warriors to two runs. Michielli was dominant on the mound throughout the season, standing in third place in the division in wins (9) and fourth in strikeouts (76).</p><p>The Renegades will look to improve more upon their gameplay, but feel confident for next year. “It's the same group of girls because nobody is graduating, and we already have a great team dynamic,” Ruhl said. Having no players leaving the team will allow the Renegades to focus on their few weaknesses and progress further into the playoffs next year.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:53:11.900849	24	1	The Renegades finished up their season with a second-round 10-0 loss to High School for Construction, but they are optimistic for the upcoming season”
168	﻿Huskies Grab Impressive Victory	huskies-grab-impressive-victory	<p>“If you asked me in March if we'd win our first playoff game, I'd probably say no.” —Lucy Wang, senior and co-captain</p><p>“Through time, we learned how to run practices and manage game logistics (subs, plays, etc.) by ourselves.” —Lauren Moy, senior and co-captain</p><p>As the game came to a close, the ninth-seeded Huskies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ lacrosse team, realized what they had just accomplished. After going winless in the playoffs for the past five years and making the playoffs for the first time last year, the team managed to upset 8-seed Forest Hills High School 5-3. Even though they lost to the number one overall team and eventual runner up Curtis High School 15-6 the next round, the team did something that hadn’t been done in recent memory. No one saw their win coming, not even the team. “If you asked me in March if we'd win our first playoff game, I'd probably say no,” senior and co-captain Lucy Wang said.</p><p>The team faced adversity from the start, as their former coach, Jenna Gilbert, was replaced by coach Manuel Simon. While Simon stepped up and coached the team, he was not too familiar with the sport. His coaching responsibility fell on the captains. “Through time, we learned how to run practices and manage game logistics (subs, plays,!etc.) by ourselves,” Wang said. Another senior and co-captain, Lauren Moy, had a similar sentiment, saying, “We had to do a lot of the teaching and giving criticism during games, which was hard, since we’re also trying to be regular players.” Luckily, they were able to figure things out and keep their season going.</p><p>After a rough start to the season that included four straight rain-outs, the team rebounded and finished third in their division, Division 3, with a 10-4 record. Only Bronx High School of Science (12-2) and Hunter High School (14-0) finished ahead of them in the standings. This was the first year of Division 3, as previous years broke up teams by borough. Last year, the team finished 6-10 before losing to Tottenville in the first round of the playoffs 17-6. The year before that they did not qualify for a playoff berth.</p><p>A number of upperclassmen became major forces in the PSAL, but none improved as much as Wang. As an attacker/midfielder, Wang doubled the number of goals she scored from last season to this one, from 49 to 100. Her 100 goals scored led the PSAL, with the next closest person 23 goals behind her, at 77. Her leadership and goal-scoring was much needed, and her three goals in the playoff game against Forest Hills High School proved to be the deciding factors.</p><p>However, the win was more than just Wang. It was a team effort, especially by the seniors. “All the seniors in general are starters and have really shaped this team into something,” junior and co-captain Inbar Pe’er said. “When they were freshmen, it was no cuts, and they worked so hard to create a real team and a work ethic.” These seniors worked and bided their time, and after four years, they finally found success.</p><p>The team will suffer next year, with eight seniors leaving, including top goal-scorer Wang and goalie and co-captain Maddie Ostergaard. “A lot of the starting lineup consisted of seniors, so it'll probably be a tough adjustment,” Wang said. “But I think they can succeed.” They held many key positions on the field, and finding capable replacements will not be easy. Many underclassmen will have to improve and work hard to fill the spots on the roster vacated by the graduating class.</p><p>The team recently voted captains for next year, and decided on juniors Pe’er, Leila Storkamp, and Sara Ng. It could be a tough year, but if the team was able to weather a loss of a coach and a difficult beginning and still win a playoff game, getting back to this point next season is not out of the question. A young and athletic team, these Huskies could be just beginning to reach their peak.</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:54:12.682974	24	1	The Huskies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ lacrosse team, won their first playoff game in recent memory before losing to Curtis in the next round.
169	﻿Promising Season Falls Short for Peglegs	promising-season-falls-short-for-peglegs	<p>Down three runs to none with two outs in the bottom of the seventh, with junior Michael Gillow at the plate, the Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s baseball team, watched their season hang by a thread. Gillow worked up a full count and fought off some pitches, clearly determined to keep the game alive. Finally, after a formidable battle at the plate, Gillow made contact and hit a line drive to center field. As the ball entered the glove of the running McKee/Staten Island tech Seagulls’ center fielder, the Peglegs watched the most promising season in their recent history slip away. Final score, 3-0 Seagulls.</p><p>The Peglegs struggled with hitting throughout the entire game. It seemed as if they were making contact but simply couldn't find the holes in the opposing defense. As a result, the team only managed five hits in the game. Unfortunately, senior and co-captain Tobias Lange’s solid performance, in which he allowed just three runs in six innings and struck out five batters, was trumped by the absence of production on the offensive side of the ball for the Peglegs. When asked about the game, head coach John Carlesi said, “Everything went well but our hitting. Pitching was excellent, and we didn't make an error in the field. Unfortunately, their pitching held us to no runs, and I've never heard a team win while scoring zero runs.” The Seagulls scored one run in the first, third, and sixth innings, and that was enough to advance to the next round of the playoffs. “The last game was tough, knowing what most if these guys put into the team, the time, sacrifice and hard work; there wasn't a dry eye after that last out, including myself,” Carlesi said.</p><p>Despite the disappointing ending to the season, where the Peglegs expected to go deep in the playoffs, the team has quite a bit to be proud of. This was the best season under head coach John Carlesi, and the team won more games this year (12) than they won in the previous two seasons combined (10).  “I am disappointed in the early loss, but I am really proud of the way our team competed this year. Being the number 10 team in the city and the best team in Stuy history is nothing to be ashamed of,” senior and co-captain Jack Archer said. The season featured many memorable victories against difficult rivals—a victory against a Bayside team that was fresh off a championship victory, and a walk-off by senior Joseph Halim to defeat rival Beacon High School. “I would say beating Beacon on a walk off was the highpoint of our season. But to me, getting to spend all my time with this team has been the most rewarding part of the season. The baseball guys are like brothers. We have fed off of each other all year, and it has contributed to our success,” Archer said.</p><p>The strength of the pitching staff was a primary reason why the Peglegs fought their way to a successful season. Archer and senior and co-captain Tobias Lange had serious expectations of leading the team to success through their arms—and they did just that. The two were not only the best pitchers on the team, but they were two of the best in the AAA Western division. They each had five wins, tied for first in the division. Lange finished the season with 56 strikeouts and an earned run average (ERA) of 1.22. Archer was right behind him, finishing the year with 43 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.03. These statistics put these seniors among the best arms in the division. However, the offense and defensive contributions from many players on the team is what helped the Peglegs make a good season into a great one. Most importantly, “it was the team’s dynamics that really help during the season. The different personalities fed off one another in good times and bad. You couldn't ask for a better chemistry in a team,” Carlesi said.</p><p>Ultimately, as the peglegs reflect on the success and fun they had this season, they also look toward the next one in hopes that they can continue the unprecedented progress they made over the past four years. As Carlesi said and Archer seconded, “I'm hoping that Max Onderdonk, Jeremy Rubin and Malcolm Hubbell can lead this team next year. I can only hope they are up to the task.”</p>	107	16	f	2017-06-09 22:57:55.149	2017-11-24 20:54:34.435156	24	1	They  look toward the next one in hopes that they can continue the unprecedented progress they made over the past four years.
170	﻿“Concerned Stuyvesant Alumni” Boycott Alumni Association Over Issues of Transparency and Accountability	concerned-stuyvesant-alumni-boycott-alumni-association-over-issues-of-transparency-and-accountability	<p>Concerned Stuyvesant Alumni (CSA), a forum of alumni, announced a boycott of the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association (SHSAA) during the SHSAA’s Annual General Meeting on May 3, to protest an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. The forum is calling on alumni to donate directly to the school instead of through the SHSAA.</p><p>The SHSAA, a non-profit organization, funds programs and events within the Stuyvesant community, and holds events for alumni, primarily reunions. The SHSAA consists of alumni members who pay dues and have the right to vote and serve on the board, and basic members, alumni who do not pay dues but can take part in committees, without the right to vote or serve in leadership roles.</p><p>Tensions amongst alumni arose in 2013 and 2014 when two former alumni groups, the Friends of Stuyvesant (FOS) and Campaign for Stuyvesant (CFS), began efforts to merge with the SHSAA to form one alumni association for the school. During this period, the SHSAA adopted new by-laws related to the governance of the organization.</p><p>After the announcement of the merger process, many alumni began discussing their shared concern about the future of the organization. “[Our] efforts really began three years ago as more and more of us realized that we weren’t having a positive experience with the Alumni Association,” CSA member Nicholas Griffin (‘80) said. These alumni decided to create an informal forum, known as the CSA, where they could propose reforms and push for information about the by-laws. The CSA is not an actual organization with official members, and alumni associated with the forum primarily use Facebook to communicate with each other.</p><p>Many alumni contend that the merger negotiations were conducted without their knowledge and that the by-laws failed to increase transparency within the SHSAA. “SHSAA directors adopted new by-laws on September 11, 2013, and kept them secret until May 2014,” CSA member Dr. Jeff Golland (‘57) said in an e-mail interview. “These by-laws created an endowment and a board of trustees to run it within the SHSAA, but with nearly no accountability to the trustees. [...] Who the negotiators were was never made public.”</p><p>The SHSAA, however, claims that negotiation meetings were made public and that a lack of initiative on the part of certain alumni contributed to much of the confusion. “When we had an agreed upon framework, the representatives of the Association brought it back to the Board and membership for discussion and debate. That took place over a number of open and public Board Meetings.  Our meetings are open to all members and non-member alumni [...] I don’t recall any of the dissident members ever having come to a board meeting,” SHSAA President Soo Kim (‘93) said.</p><p>The CSA argues that further attempts to discuss the merger process were rebuffed by the directors of the SHSAA. “Those trustees were the leaders of the Campaign for Stuyvesant, and so when we discovered that, we [said] [...] that’s fine but give us more information about these trustees,” CSA member Neal Wilson (‘81) said. “The board got very tight-lipped and refused to answer any of our questions.”</p><p>The SHSAA responded by stating their procedure for electing trustees. “[The trustees] serve a longer term—six years as opposed to directors with three. They have a self-selection process that you might see in many non-profit bodies, such as the Harvard Corporation or most non-member charities. If the committee does not assent, the trustee candidate cannot serve," Kim said.</p><p>Further scrutiny by the CSA into the operations of the SHSAA prompted new concerns over the association’s budget and the allocation of funds. The SHSAA diverted funds from the funding of school clubs and teams in order to fund the establishment of an endowment. “We were confused, if the Alumni Association was not helping out with needs of the school, what were they doing?” Wilson said.</p><p>Although the SHSAA releases financial reports in the form of IRS 990C forms, as it is legally obliged to do, many alumni believe that the association should strive for greater accuracy and transparency. “IRS 990C forms are usually a year or two behind because they need to be based on audited financial information, and that takes time to complete. Volunteer organizations typically distribute (and often publish) a current financial report, and that’s what we have been asking the board to do,” CSA member Dr. Beth Knobel (‘80) said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>The CSA has also expressed dissatisfaction with the nomination and election process for leadership positions in the SHSAA. Current SHSAA board members are responsible for nominating future candidates, with each board member serving a term of three years.</p><p>“Applicants have to be dues-paying members of good standing, and must acknowledge they’re willing to meet our criteria for participation, giving, and best practices. They are evaluated on a number of criteria, [including] [...] how much they give in terms of time, how much they give in terms of money, and what they bring in terms of gravitas and experience, ” Kim said.</p><p>The CSA takes issue with this process, because they believe this allows the Board of Directors to eliminate candidates who disagree with the management of the association. “There was no competition, they could have been elected with one vote according to the bylaws. They had 850 votes out of 350,000 living alumni, and there was no one running against them,” Wilson said.</p><p>This year, SHSAA board members selected seven nominees for seven vacant positions. Members are also able to stand for elections by submitting a petition signed by a minimum of 50 alumni members or five percent of the total alumni members. No candidates, however, used the petition process this year.</p><p>In response to this criticism, the SHSAA noted that it reserved the right to determine the qualifying criteria for its leaders. “Every group has a right to enforce its own standards and that’s what you’re seeing.  Our volunteers work hard, they spend a lot of time and effort, and they enforce standards of the same high level of volunteerism amongst anyone [who] wants to join. Before you can express your opinion as to what you think will be good for the Association, you have to show that you contribute to the Association [...] and this is not about money, because by far the most valuable contribution is time,” Kim said.</p><p>Notwithstanding the claims of election malpractice, alumni currently associated with the CSA, including Dr. Knobel, have been elected to the Board of Directors in the past. Knobel resigned halfway into her term, however, to protest the SHSAA’s alleged attempts to prevent reform. “In my year and a half on the board, I tried to help the SHSAA improve. I ran the Communications Committee, and tried to improve newsletters and social media communication with alums,” Knobel said. “Those efforts were met with open hostility. I was badmouthed and even bullied for my efforts. One board member actually told me he hated me because I was pressing for the SHSAA to change.”</p><p>The CSA also argues that these restrictions on elections have been detrimental to the Alumni Association. “This is a public high school [...] Everything needs to be done in the light of day. If they were to adopt better practices with regard to nominations, access to the board, leadership; if they went beyond the nickel and dime attitude, they would actually be able to expand their membership. Their membership has actually been going down,” Griffin said.</p><p>Though the discourse between the two groups started with the CSA creating petitions and attending SHSAA meetings, hostilities heightened when the CSA began to make comments on the SHSAA Facebook page. The SHSAA responded by censoring the CSA’s comments. “I'm not allowed to post any comments on their Facebook page, as are all CSA people. All of our comments need to be approved before they're posted, and they don’t approve any of our comments, they leave them in pending status,” Wilson said.</p><p>This led to the creation of the CSA’s own Facebook page and website. Kim has joined the CSA’s Facebook page twice, in order to respond to concerns raised by the CSA.  “[Kim] didn’t answer our questions. [...] He joined the page for a week, essentially and created a lot of storm and controversy, and then quit the page, and then came back a few months later and did it again,” Wilson said.</p><p>The SHSAA justified their decision to remove select CSA members from their Facebook page, stating that the CSA had launched spam attacks on the page. “They have launched coordinated efforts where 20 of them repeat posts [...] on the Facebook page and what they’re trying to do is get us to delete their stuff or warn them and then ban them. We’ve fallen for it and we’ve banned them for violating the group rules and then they use that to say that we’re censoring them,” Kim said.</p><p>Tensions came to a head this month when the CSA decided to announce a boycott to protest the SHSAA. “We avoided this step for a long time [...] After three years trying to negotiate, we decided that there is a culture in the organization that is allergic to change,” Griffin said. “Three years is enough time to show their good faith and they haven’t [done so].”</p><p>The CSA called all members to divert funds from the SHSAA to other associations, such as the Parents’ Association, following an annual general meeting held on Wednesday, May 3, 201. “We are encouraging financial and other support [...] directly to the school, its departments, or individual student organizations.  We plan to keep at it until SHSAA returns to collaboration with its active membership, especially established reunion leaders.” Dr. Golland said.</p><p>Senior board members of the SHSAA are also beginning to resign from their positions. “About a whole dozen of board members [...] have walked out the door because they don’t like the way things are being run,” Wilson said.  The petition on the CSA website, which asks signees to divert donations and end their membership until the SHSAA implements change, currently has 204 signatures.</p><p>The CSA hopes that the SHSAA will soon be able to agree with their proposed reforms regarding accountability and transparency within the association. “[We want the SHSAA to] propose regular public reporting on dues and fundraising.  If fundraising is successful, leaders should want that to be known.  The silence suggests failure,” Dr. Golland said. The CSA would also like less money to go toward overhead such as salaries, which right now, makes up more than a third of donated funds</p><p>Regarding the election process, members of the CSA would like the SHSAA to have several more candidates than vacant positions. “Giving alumni choice of candidates to be their representatives is standard operating procedure at most alumni associations. Many of its own procedures, particularly the checks and balances [were] put in place by previous boards and legal counsel[s] to ensure good management,” Knobel said.</p><p>The SHSAA plans to move forward from this divide and continue to encourage alumni to give back to the association. “We have tried for years to engage them, as we have seen how schism and multiple organizations can hurt the community, but it has been fruitless. I don’t know if it’s possible to make them happy. I try to tell everyone in the Association not to take it personally and that is the nature of leadership and organizations," Kim said.</p><p>Despite the rift, the CSA looks forward to sitting down with the SHSAA to tap into the resources offered by Stuyvesant’s alumni. “There is so much more that can be done with the great people who have gone through 15th Street and Chambers Street over the decades that we can and should be doing,” Griffin said.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:25:21.038535	1	1	Concerned Stuyvesant Alumni (CSA), a forum of alumni, announced a boycott of the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association (SHSAA) in protest of a alleged lack of transparency and accountability.
171	﻿Eric Contreras Appointed to Principal of Stuyvesant	eric-contreras-appointed-to-principal-of-stuyvesant	<p>Former Interim Acting Principal Eric Contreras was confirmed as the Principal of Stuyvesant High School on Friday, March 31. He served as the Interim Acting Principal for seven months following former Principal Jie Zhang’s retirement from the Department of Education (DOE) last year.</p><p>Contreras has an extensive background in the education field. He originally worked as a social studies teacher in the Bronx and Queens and moved on to become the Assistant Principal and Principal of the Queens High School of Teaching for seven years. Contreras also served as the Executive Director of Social Studies for New York City’s DOE.</p><p>After Contreras went through the C-30 process and became Interim Acting Principal, the DOE issued a posting for the permanent Principal position, to which Contreas and many others applied for.</p><p>The application for principal consisted of two main stages. In the first, a panel consisting of parents, students, and faculty interviewed applicants and selected the person whom they felt was the most qualified. In the second stage, the superintendent had to vet the chosen person.</p><p>“Frequently people would ask me, you know, are you anxious [for the interview], and the answer was actually, no I wasn’t. [...] So many great things and exciting things happen at Stuyvesant daily, [so] I never really had time to think [about] the interview process,” Contreras said. The superintendent named Contreras as the principal on March 31, after he passed through both stages of the application.</p><p>Contreras feels ecstatic to be appointed as principal, but also feels the same sense of mission he felt as an Interim Acting Principal. “I was extremely excited, happy, and honored, but [the confirmation] didn’t change my work. I was waking up with a sense of obligation before I became appointed, and I was waking up with a sense of obligation after I became appointed. [...] The initiatives I’m working on [...] [didn’t change] from the day before I got appointed to the day after,” he said.</p><p>Contreras is currently undertaking many initiatives to improve Stuyvesant, including an effort to strengthen the research program. “One thing I did was bringing together research coordinators, alumni, and teachers [who] had some input on what had worked in the past and we had developed a very strategic plan around strengthening our research program,” he said. “We had a research panel event, we put together parent research night, we collaborated with a number of nonprofits, and I held meetings with labs to see if they would open up space for our [students].”</p><p>Additionally, Contreras plans on improving the technology and engineering programs at Stuyvesant. Amongst the proposed changes are plans to expand current courses and create new ones tailored around subjects such as aerospace engineering, engineering design, and mechanical engineering.</p><p>Contreras is also actively working with Parent Coordinator Dina Ingram to foster a sense of community amongst the parents. “We have put together a series of parent events, wellness events, and parent meetings,” he said. In addition, Ingram is also working to create a bi-weekly publication that covers day-to-day activities and student events for parents to read.</p><p>Contreras hopes that his changes help bring about a unique and versatile experience to each student. “There is a complexity to a [Stuyvesant] student that is second to none so the formula to [create] a great STEM school [is] to allow learning across all disciplines,” he said. “ If you want complex thinkers, you need to create a complex experience.”</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:26:00.185214	1	1	Former Interim Acting Principal Eric Contreras promoted to permanent principal.

The event was organized by Japanese teacher Chie Helinski and an organizational cabinet of junior students to showcase various aspects of this culture.</p><p>Assistant Principal of the World Languages Dr. Ernest Oliveri has assisted teachers in organizing festivities, such as the Día de los Muertos Celebration and the Chinese New Year Festival throughout this year.</p><p>The event was conceived after these celebrations, when Ms. Helinski began brainstorming a Japanese cultural event. Much of the inspiration for the event stemmed from Japandemonium, an annual celebration of Japanese culture already held in the Japanese classes. Kodomo No hi, or Children’s Day, was suggested as the date to schedule the event.</p><p>“We needed to prepare the decorations, make sure we had enough food, and also organize how the extra credit was going to work,” junior and President of the Cabinet Liz Lee said.</p><p>The event offered various activities for attendees. “We wanted to make it more hands-on so we formed a committee of students which focused some events on craft. We added [a thousand] origami cranes around the poster of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [as] that’s culturally done. [In Japan,] for New Year’s, people go to shrines. They get fortune readings. So, we organized fortune readings for students. July 7 is the Star Festival. It's a big international holiday and celebration. [The Japanese] make [Tanabata] wishes on paper. So we did just that,” Helinski said.</p><p>The event was positively received by many students. “I entered the raffle right away. The food and sweets were amazing. I really enjoyed watching the festivities and participating in some of the events that I only saw in movies, like writing down my wishes. It was even better because lots of my friends went, though extra credit really helped convince them to go,” sophomore Anne Zhang said.</p><p>The festival attracted a large volume of people, causing some issues for organizers. “Although I had fun, after 10th period, the hallways were really crowded and it was a little overwhelming. At one point I just wanted to leave because there were so many people, ” Zhang said.</p><p>Organizers addressed these concerns of overcrowding and difficulties in planning. “We ran out of food really fast, and some decorations were being teared off, not intentionally of course, as people were pushed against walls with the lack of space,” sophomore Dillan Blake said.</p><p>The Japanese department has already begun looking to next year’s celebration to make further improvements to the festival. “It [will] definitely [be] in the cafeteria next year with probably a megaphone to talk to the whole crowd,” Helinski said.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:26:24.847365	1	1	The first annual Japan Day was hosted on May 5.

280	﻿Academic Dishonesty: The Teacher’s View	academic-dishonesty-the-teacher-s-view	<p><h4>Lauren Stuzin, English</h4></p><p><b>What’s your perception of cheating, especially encompassing plagiarism in the English Department?</b></p><p>I would say I haven’t encountered it all that often, which makes me happy, because I think students should rather have ideas of their own than take from online. But I do think that when it does happen it’s mostly because you guys are very overwhelmed and stressed, and there’s only so much time in your days. So while it’s really bad to plagiarize, and no one should do it—you should try to come up with your own ideas—it’s better to have this happen in high school and to learn from it than for it to happen in the future. So I do think it’s a learning experience, and I understand that students can feel overwhelmed with the amount of work at Stuyvesant.</p><p><b>If you catch a student cheating (plagiarizing), what happens?</b></p><p>In the English department if you plagiarise an assignment you’ll receive a zero for that assignment. You’ll also probably have a conversation with the Assistant Principal [Eric] Grossman regarding plagiarism and problems with it, and what constitutes plagiarism. Then, you’re expected to not do that again, and you’ll be able to submit future assignments.</p><p><b>Do you agree with Stuyvesant’s cheating policy?</b></p><p>Yes, I do think it’s important that students are aware of the fact that plagiarizing is a problem, and I think that students are going to need to know in college. And it’s good to know the rules for citation, and also, I think receiving a zero on the assignment you plagiarized is a fair punishment.</p><p><b>Stuyvesant is notorious for cheating—a couple years ago we had the Regents scandal, and last year, we had this scandal in the Spanish Department. What do you think makes cheating unique at Stuy, or so widespread?</b></p><p>I think it’s the fact that Stuyvesant students have way more work than any other school, and I do think at least I try to keep aware of the amount of homework I’m assigning and how long readings are taking—because I don’t want to necessarily add to that work. I don’t want students to feel like my work is busy work, or just taking up time. I want to make sure that what I assign is meaningful, so it doesn’t just add to this burden that you guys feel every day when you go home and have hours and hours of homework ahead of you. I feel like sometimes teachers forget students have lives outside of school and belong to a million extracurriculars. You’re very active in your communities, and you have stuff to do at home.</p><p><b>Have you ever cheated when you were little, like in high school?</b></p><p>I think in high school I probably shared homework. I distinctly remember once in elementary school I ratted someone else out for cheating and I felt really bad about that when I was 11.</p><p><h4>Dr. Jeffrey Kivi</h4></p><p><b>What do you think about cheating? Why do kids do it? What do you do to try to stop cheating from happening?</b></p><p>I give multiple versions of a test to try to limit the temptation because I know that kids, those who weren't even planning on cheating, at the spur of the moment, give in to temptation to look at the test of the student next to them. That’s why I give out multiple tests to illuminate that sort of spontaneous temptation.</p><p>I used to give lots of homework and there are a lot of reasons why I have deemphasized homework but one of the reasons is that kids with the Internet and these groups that they form and they all share everything so easily, so you start to see too much of kids handing in the same homework with the same wording. And it was clear that kids weren't doing their own work and it's like, how do you stop that? And it's pretty much impossible to stop kids using the internet for helping each other out, posting answers, or looking up the answers online. To an extent, giving homework was less useful because kids weren't necessarily doing the answers on their own, they were getting them online. So that’s some of the reasons why I deemphasized it. I'd rather have kids work on something in class so they can think about it and work it out themselves or with their neighbors or teammates rather than looking up the answers that were posted in groups or online.</p><p><b>What do you do when you find a student is cheating?</b></p><p>I don't think about it an awful lot. I leave it up to the administration to deal with overall. I just try to do things that give kids less of an opportunity make the wrong choice and hopefully encourage them to solve things on their own.</p><p><h4>Dr. Susan Barrow</h4></p><p><b>What are your experiences with cheating?</b></p><p>My experience teaching mostly Art Appreciation with freshmen is that I never worried about them cheating. I did have an experience a couple of years ago where I thought that I was vigilant, but I had classes in the morning, and a student in the afternoon had informed me that students in the cafeteria were looking at a copy of my test on Facebook. I had to involve [Assistant Principal of Security, Health, and Physical Education Brian] Moran, and I gave the student a chance to reflect on this instance. A couple of people named the same person as the perpetrator anonymously.</p><p><b>What are your methods of stopping cheating? In tests and homework?</b></p><p>I collect any phones before any test I give. Phones are out in a box. Honestly, I don't think that students understand what plagiarism is or isn't. They don't, especially freshmen, they have no clear understanding of it, the administration does a better job explaining it to them. For museum reports, I ask students to make a personal statement that says they didn't copy, they didn't plagiarize, so I think that if anyone has any integrity, they should learn when they’re young and that's the best I can do. I also walk around constantly during tests.</p><p><b>Why do you think students cheat?</b></p><p>They cheat because they don’t think they will be caught. I think that students in this school are under pressure to get good grades and the best way possible, unfortunately, is cheating, and some of them think that if they get a bad grade, it ruins their whole life or something.</p><p><b>What are your consequences for anyone caught cheating?</b></p><p>I think that students have subtle ways of cheating, but I'm not going to spend the whole day tracking down cheaters. If it's really blatant, I rip up their test or give them a zero, and in cases, not recently, but kids handing in an identical report I call them in, sit them down, and ask why the reports are virtually identical. So then one of them will eventually admit that they copied off the other.</p><p><h4>Marianne Prabhu, Biology</h4></p><p><b>Why do you think students cheat?</b></p><p>I think that students don't even realize that things they do constitute as cheating; for example, copying homework. Some students don’t even think that they’re doing it until we point it out to them.</p><p><b>What are your penalties for cheating?</b></p><p>I've never had a situation where I had to give a student a full zero or something like that. But I know for the most part, our department policy is they get a zero for that assignment.</p><p><b>How do you prevent kids from cheating?</b></p><p>One thing I do is let students use a notes guide, a specific one, on exams. This way, they don't feel like they have to cheat, they already have some of their notes in front of them, and I try to test them more on applications, so there is a lot of writing and it's hard to cheat in the first place.</p><p><h4>Jerry Citron, Biology</h4></p><p><b>Why do you think students cheat?</b></p><p>Students cheat because of a multiple of reasons, primarily stress and also because they want to do something fast and they don't want to study. The other reason students cheat is because maybe the situation in class is not fair in the way they think [it] should be, and they feel that the only way they do well is to cheat.</p><p><b>How do you stop kids from cheating?</b></p><p>There are some students who genuinely do well because they work really really hard on something. And that’s another issue. Some students take easier classes, and therefore have an easier time, and some students take a lot of AP courses and are therefore very stressed out. And I do believe that students cheat because they have five AP classes and they start to prioritize one over another. Like, ”I was able to study for this one, but not this one, but I have exams back to back. I'm going to cheat, or try to cheat.” Some kids have notes on cards, on a piece of paper, some like to write notes on their hands and some will look at other people's paper[s], so to prevent that is to make multiple copies of an exam so that there is an “A,” “B,” “C” version of the exam and that will prevent cheating in class. I walk up and down the aisles to make sure that kids aren't looking at each other’s papers or have any external examples. There are many physical things you can do, but ultimately, any kid who cheats is hurting himself, so that's how I look at it. If you’re going to cheat and do it in a way you think is being successful and you’re not being successful, you’re really just turning on yourself, and ultimately, you don't do very well in school.</p><p><b>What are your consequences for cheating?</b></p><p>If you are caught cheating on tests, you should get a zero, you should absolutely get a zero, that should be the consequence. If you do it again, then the administration should get involved. The really good students may have cheated once or twice. They just know how to manage time, manage the stress in order to learn. And there are other kids who try to circumvent the system.</p><p><b>Do you do anything to help with the stress?</b></p><p>I do test corrections when I can. Curving the exam sometimes helps. Sometimes, if I find a question is horrendous, because most students get it wrong, I just throw it out. That's my fault, not the students’. I'm trying to make it feel like the exam isn't trying to hurt them but to learn information and use it again as a tool to learn what you didn't understand before the test. So if the test can be a tool for learning, if students can see it as a tool, and not as an absolute assessment, then there might be less cheating. I don't know but that's what I'm hoping.</p><p><h4>Eric Grossman, Assistant Principal of English</h4></p><p><b>What do you think about cheating or in the case of the English department, plagiarism? Why do you think that kids do it?</b></p><p>Part of my job is to meet with students and their teachers when plagiarizing occurs. You asked about plagiarism, I'm not a big fan of it. Overwhelmingly, when it happens it happens because students feel overwhelmed and stressed out and panicky and make a bad decision last minute, often late at night, and that's understandable. The goal is to make sure that they learn from it, and while the consequences are meant to resonate, to feel meaningful enough to create an impression, they are not meant to and don't ruin lives or chances to get into a decent college. If it happens chronically, then that is a different story and a different problem.</p><p><b>Can you talk about the consequences?</b></p><p>Well, there is an academic policy of the school and if a student cheats on an assignment, whatever that looks like, if it’s a single line from a website or if it's a cut and paste, it’s still academic dishonesty. So the scale of seriousness rises or falls depending on the size of the assignment and what is sad and ironic is that when a student cheats, their hope is to do better; [however] they do much much worse. We want kids to be successful, we want them to be in structures that encourage and support that.</p><p><b>What methods do you use to stop cheating?</b></p><p>Most teachers develop [a] pretty good “spidey sense” when something appears off. In terms of strategy to discourage it, talking about it and making it clear to our students that we care about it and why we care about is the most important thing. Most students are attuned to their teachers: what they value, what they as students should value, and having those conversation[s] make it less likely to occur. It does not mean that it can never occur, but it’s just communicating what the ideas of the case are and why.</p><p><b>Do you think teachers have ways of making sure that students are working on their assignments?</b></p><p>In a lot of classes, especially in the lower grades, there are multiple due dates of multiple parts of a project. In a [Freshman Composition] class, a thesis may be due a certain day and then they'll workshop it, and passages from a book and supporting evidence may be due a certain day, and by the time the essay is actually due, there are a lot of steps along the way that give a chance for teachers to check in and make sure that students are not saving the entire thing for the night before.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 16:29:52.857198	1	1	
174	﻿New Arts and Theater Clubs Rise At Stuyvesant	new-arts-and-theater-clubs-rise-at-stuyvesant	<p>I know from personal experience that when people think of Stuyvesant, they tend to have a very limited view of what our school represents.</p><p>Many, if not all, of us can recall telling a friend that we’ve decided to attend Stuyvesant and finding ourselves thrown into a conversation about how it’s a pressure cooker of misery and how we will never be able to balance our social lives with our academics.</p><p>However, any Stuyvesant student knows that as focused as we all are on our grades and schoolwork, many have an artistic side too. In fact, our school has a long history of producing remarkable art, writing, music, and theater, from STC and SING!, to our literary magazine, Caliper, and our school newspaper, The Spectator.</p><p>I reached out to a few of the students leading new artistic clubs and publications so that I could share with the Stuyvesant community just what these groups have to offer and capture the essence of the artistic side of a school that is famous for being STEM-oriented.</p><p>Earlier in this school year, freshman Andrew Ng founded a literary magazine called The Acacia. Though it publishes many types of media, The Acacia focuses on engaging students who love writing. “Acacia is made up of mostly freshmen, so it is easier for everyone to bond and be friends,” freshman Fawziyah Khan said.</p><p>Because of its large freshman membership, Acacia may be a model of the future of Stuyvesant. It provides the newest generation of students with their own outlet.</p><p>“I got [the] idea to found my pub because I wanted to give students a special medium to express themselves through writing,” Ng explained. “ I personally love writing, and I wanted to give that level of empowerment to everybody else.”</p><p>Ng isn’t the only student trying to create artistic spaces to help his peers express themselves. The Stuyvesant Broadcasting Community (SBC) is one of the more ambitious new clubs this year. “It's mainly intended to broadcast things like news, music, videos/audio we might record. We also display art and write stories,”  junior and SBC President Alexandra Wen said. They are pioneering a new medium for students to express themselves. Wen is optimistic about their club’s potential, saying, “I can easily see us doing well, being able to prepare for future projects, and having everything organized.”</p><p>Freshman and SBC Vice President Chris Brown, who will be inheriting Wen’s position of president next year, said, “One idea we had was a talk show or interview show where we could invite students or teachers to be featured.”</p><p>Chances are you saw the red posters with the word “RIOT!” on them hanging from walls and escalators all over the school building earlier this year. RIOT stands for Rampage of Imagination and Original Theater, and this new theater company has some of Stuyvesant’s best theater writers and creators on board. Sophomore, Co-founder, and Vice President Noelle Gloria said, “RIOT! is a script writing club, so we intend for our members to produce skits or short plays to perform at SOS, and, when RIOT! grows bigger and more established, we even hope to hold our own showcase.”</p><p>The relaxed and creative atmosphere of the club is part of what makes it so special. Freshman Matthew Carlson says, “There isn't such a thing as a typical RIOT! Meeting.”</p><p>Yet it still has big goals for its members, and each meeting has a purpose that its members are always motivated to execute together.</p><p>The creative spirit of RIOT! defies every stereotype and false expectation surrounding Stuyvesant. A student theater company opposes that common belief that all the students are dedicated only to math and science. “In improv, you really have to think on your feet, which is something that many don't associate with STEM subjects. Also, the creativity is definitely something that defies the STEM stereotype. It's a good thing in improv to take a creative approach to the prompt, your character, or the scene in general,” Carlson said.</p><p>Sophomores Elena Sapelyuk and Klaire Geller also created Stuyvesant Fine Arts, a chapter of the National Art Honors Society. It is run much like Stuyvesant’s Red Cross, with hour requirements for certification.</p><p>“I realized that there wasn't really a place for people at Stuy[vesant] to create art. Our school is so focused on STEM subjects and academics, many people who are artistically inclined feel guilty for taking time out of their schedule to express themselves,” Sapelyuk said. “I wanted to create a space where everyone can create as well as collaborate and give back to the community. [We] paint a flower or laugh while collaborating on a project.”</p><p>The purpose of this club is a combination of creating visual art itself and volunteering. Each club meeting has a theme or a lesson. They even travel to the Brookdale Senior Center on a monthly basis to provide watercolor classes, and they hope to work on large mural projects around the school building.</p><p>“The elders really show their joy being with us. They make us feel comfortable with our environment. Through the few volunteering experiences, I have made friends with a 101-year-old and an Asian-American elder,” said sophomore Kate Shen in an e-mail interview. “The 101-year-old show[ed] so much happiness when she completed her first painting, saying she is going to show her son her accomplishment. The Asian-American elder started to talk to me about her children and her life stories.”</p><p>Freshman Sara Stebbin and the members of her new club “Stuycatto” approach art through the medium of song.</p><p>“Music composition is something I love and am  passionate about, but I never really had a group of friends who shared that interest,” Stebbins said.</p><p>While the music created by the members ranges from classical to contemporary, Stuycatto is as much a uniting force for teenage musicians as Stuyvesant is for ambitious students who are pursuing various types of careers. “The Stuyccato community is a friendly one, so sharing music is always encouraged,” junior Jason Lee said. “I enjoy the positive feedback and criticism that I'm given because it pushes me to improve my music. Honestly, when I want to share anything, I can always turn to the people in Stuyccato.”</p><p>The formation of clubs like these within our community reflect an evolving environment at Stuyvesant. Young artists are making a place for themselves and their creation, and forging a path for all students to pursue a more well-rounded education. These people are intelligent and hard-working, while also being creative. It just goes to show: Stuyvesant is not only a place for STEM-centric students.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:29:30.682096	3	1	A review and investigation of several rising student-run clubs and publications at Stuy and what they are creating for the Stuyvesant community within the context of our school’s reputation for being STEM-oriented.
175	﻿Stuy Afloat on the Sea of Numbers	stuy-afloat-on-the-sea-of-numbers	<p>A social life, good grades, and enough sleep—choose wisely, because you can only pick two. The ideal Stuyvesant student has perfect grades, great extracurriculars, and great potential—that includes the great potential of developing mental health issues. Outside of the classroom, it’s more common to hear “I’m going to kill myself” or “Please push me off of a building” followed by laughter, rather than “I’m gonna take a break.”</p><p>Our parents, our teachers, and even our peers talk about how we’re supposed to be the best and the brightest, how we’re supposed to be leading the nation to great things someday. We knew the rigorous academic setting we were getting into. But why does that mean we “don’t get to complain”?</p><p>To my parents, my Stuyvesant experience is nothing more than a number. When I (Marie) get home, I’m not met with, “Did you learn anything interesting today?” Instead, my parents ask me whether I got any grades back or what tests I have coming up.</p><p>They expect me to get good grades, and if I don’t meet their expectations, I am lectured about how I’m not going to get into a “good” college. Even after countless mental breakdowns about grades, there’s no room to complain because as a Stuy student, I’m expected to deal with it. After all, Stuyvesant is a place where the ends justify the means: as long as you get into a good college, your experience here doesn’t matter.</p><p>With 3,350 students in a 10-floor building, the competition is immense and the pressure to succeed can make or break you. It’s the prime example of a “sink-or-swim” environment, and most students seem to float around during their four years.</p><p>Unfortunately, a large number of students “sink,” especially with this year’s increase in mental health-related hospitalizations. What if the notion of the “perfect Stuy kid” just doesn’t exist and we are all just sinking ships? Do some of us just take longer to drown?</p><p>I (Alex) cannot, using both hands, count the amount of times that I’ve drowned. During freshman year, suicidal ideations intruded my daily thoughts. During sophomore year, anxiety attacks were so common that at my low points, they felt more like sinking than shaking.</p><p>Instead of being proud of one’s well-being, many Stuy students take pride in the exact things that cause many mental health problems: numbers. The numbers mean everything, from the amount of likes on a profile picture to the grades that colleges see. And we, as students who grew up thinking that numbers were worth more than us, use that exact system to rank ourselves too. Before we even got into this school, we were already a statistic. On the SHSAT, a test with a simple cut-off score, you either get in or you don’t.</p><p>At Stuy, college admissions dominate everything. Some students create clubs for the sole purpose of making themselves look good, and others go to clubs that seem “scholarly.” The option of doing something because it makes you happy rather than because it makes you look good for college is uncommon.</p><p>The students who do create or go to clubs that aren’t geared toward adding that extra touch on their college application are commonly questioned about their intentions. Why’d you make it? What college are you trying to impress? It’s almost like finding rare birds, but they’re only rare because they’ve been driven to near extinction.</p><p>We have been questioned about the creation of Stuy Limitless, a club we made for both the purpose of helping people with their self-confidence and for helping ourselves along the road of recovery from mental illnesses. The joke “Did you make this for college?” isn’t funny when you realize that other students genuinely believe this. That shakes us to the core—to realize that an environment that cultivates learning is the same one that cannot see past numbers.</p><p>But, no one is born with a superiority complex. No one pops out of the womb screaming, “I’m better than you for having one more point on my exam!” People claim that this is just the “Stuy attitude,” but, by doing that, they’re only dismissing the problem instead of facing it. How many Stuy students have to drown before we actually address this issue?</p><p>Luckily, as junior year comes to a close, I (Alex) have recovered. I’ve used my resources when I’ve hit my low points this year; I’ve gone to guidance and to the nurse. Resources are available to us, such as the SPARK program’s free, confidential counseling.</p><p>The administration has started to change their mentality, with guidance department meetings starting to focus more on mental health and the effects of stress, and presentations focusing on teaching freshmen how to cope effectively with it. But, there’s only so much they can do to solve the problem if the main issue is ourselves.</p><p>Most of us expect our peers, teachers, and parents to be able to see that we are drowning. We expect them to throw a life jacket to save us, but everyone is in their own bubble. Rather than waiting for other people to notice that we are struggling, we need to take action for ourselves and actively seek help.</p><p>We need to stop being stone walls, with our mental health resources bouncing off of us like rubber balls. As students, we need to start reaching out more instead of waiting for others to come to us. One cannot fix a problem without first recognizing it—so we, the student body, now need to change before our own foundation falls out from under us.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:33:04.051433	2	1	The importance of success is overemphasized in Stuyvesant’s mentality and has become toxic, thus leading to a dismissal of mental health when the issues should instead be gaining attention.
176	﻿An Obligation to Strangers	an-obligation-to-strangers	<p>Suppose one day you’re walking alongside a shallow pond when you notice a child has fallen in and appears to be drowning. You run to where the child is, but just when you’re about to pull the child out of the water, you remember that you are on your way to an important event and you’re dressed in your most expensive outfit. Do you have an obligation to save the child, despite the risk of ruining your pricey clothing?</p><p>To this, nearly everyone would say yes. The material worth of clothing is meaningless when compared to the value of a human life; clothing is replaceable, but a person’s life is not.</p><p>Now, let’s add some caveats to this thought experiment. Imagine there are several other people standing around the pond, but they refuse to help the child. Do you still jump in even though other people won’t? Of course. The inaction of others doesn't mean it's okay to let the child drown. Now, imagine the child drowning lived in a different state than you. Again, most would argue that factors like location or nationality do not change the value of one’s life, and thus we are still morally obliged to save the child’s life.</p><p>According to philosopher Peter Singer in his book “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” at every moment, we are all choosing to neglect the drowning child and give up on moral duties. By choosing to spend money on material luxuries instead of donating to effective charities that help those in extreme poverty or on the verge of death, we are in effect choosing our expensive clothing over another person’s life. We have already established that the location and nationality of the child, as well as the inaction of others, are all morally irrelevant in our obligation to save someone’s life. If this is the case, then very little separates our hypothetical obligation to the drowning child from our actual obligation to children in abject poverty abroad.</p><p>One could argue that saving a life in the real world is not as simple as lifting a child out of a pond. In reality, though, there has never before been a time in history when it has been so easy to save someone’s life. Controlled studies of humanitarian efforts allow experts to identify which charities are the most effective at saving lives. According to William Macaskill of Oxford University in his book “Doing Good Better,” some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others, meaning they can save a life for a fraction of the cost. GiveWell, an organization that scrutinizes the efficacy of charitable practices, has selected a handful of charities that are particularly outstanding.</p><p>The Against Malaria Foundation, for instance, provides long-lasting insecticide-laced bed nets to children in Sub-Saharan Africa for $2.50 per treatment. With every $3,300 in donations, the Against Malaria Foundation is able to save one life. Another charity, Deworm the World, provides pills that rid children in Kenya and India of parasitic intestinal worms at a cost of only 55 cents per treatment. The World Health Organization finds that 880 million children worldwide suffer from parasitic worms, an often overlooked global health problem. Though usually not life-threatening, parasitic worms are a cause of immense suffering, and have been shown to significantly reduce school attendance.</p><p>If your financial situation prohibits you from putting aside money to donate to effective charities, then it is difficult to maintain the argument that you would be obliged to donate. However, if you believe that you do have some wiggle room in your daily expenditures, even small alterations could have a huge impact. Something as simple as switching from Chipotle to halal could save you $5.00, which could in turn provide either two bed nets or 10 deworming pills to those in need, and packing your lunch at home and taking it to school could do even more.</p><p>At very little cost to our material well-being, we can have a superhero-like effect on the world by letting an 80-year-old blind man see for the first time through a cataracts operation, or even preventing a mother in Ghana from having the grief and sorrow of losing a child to infectious disease. If you are willing to sacrifice your expensive clothing for the drowning child, then you should be willing to switch from Chipotle to halal or forgo another pair of shoes and donate money to where it will mean a lot more. If you really agree with this, back it up with action—the world will thank you.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:33:30.142808	2	1	Given that a couple thousand dollars can save someone’s life if given to the right charity, people who are financially capable have an obligation to allocate some of their resources to help people abroad.
177	﻿Changes On the Horizon for the Big Sib Program: Good or Bad?	changes-on-the-horizon-for-the-big-sib-program-good-or-bad	<p>Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names. What it does require is initiative on the part of Big Sibs to introduce themselves and make legitimate connections.</p><p>Focus Sentence: Summarize the focus of the story in one sentence</p><p>“We have for years referred to them as mini-counselors. They are the ones getting to see the freshmen and the transfer sophomore students the most in the beginning, and are the most tuned-in to how they are doing in their transition,” Assistant Principal of Guidance Casey Pedrick said.</p><p>Even so, the guidance office has decided to play a larger role in Stuyvesant’s Big Sib program in the hope of improving its organization and effectiveness. In the past, the Big Sib program was completely student-run, from the application process and selection to homeroom management and Big Sib accountability.</p><p>Applications were not standardized and were based heavily on the Big Sib Chairs’ personal judgments, while attendance records were rarely kept for homerooms. As a result, the program seemed to be more oriented toward the privilege of being a Big Sib, rather than offering support systems to incoming students.</p><p>Of the Little Sibs surveyed, 48.9 percent reported knowing all of their Big Sibs’ names. This is certainly a mark of success, but it also means a slight majority of Little Sibs did not know their Big Sibs’ names. Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names. What it does require is initiative on the part of Big Sibs to introduce themselves and make legitimate connections.</p><p>At its core, these problems stem from an issue with the highly subjective selection of Big Sibs. “There are some people who either should not be Big Sibs or just don’t do their jobs as Big Sibs,” Big Sib Chair Kevin Li said. Also surrounding the program is the stigma of nepotism.</p><p>To alleviate these problems, the guidance office has revamped the selection process by adding an anonymous first stage with a rubric. “In the beginning, [the Big Sib Chairs] are giving points to things in different areas [based on] the rubric. None of that was ever done before. It was just them reviewing it on paper, taking their little notes, having the interviews. At least now you have an anonymous review with a rubric you are following,” Pedrick said.</p><p>A concern with a rubric-based application, however, is that it focuses too much on academic performance. It is important to have students with a variety of perspectives and achievement levels in the program.</p><p>In some instances, the rubric appears to be almost an afterthought—interviews, for instance, began before an interview rubric was finalized. This system was created in order to provide students with a concrete idea of why they may not have been accepted into the program, yet it should not exist simply to cover that base.</p><p>It is important to strike a balance between transparency and avoiding robotic selections. One important step that has been taken is lowering the grade requirement for Big Sib applicants from an 88 to an 85 and being more strict about maintaining this baseline; the new cut-off will allow more students to be eligible while also standardizing the process.</p><p>Many upperclassmen, once selected for the program, also find that there is no incentive to be an active participant; even with homeroom leaders, some freshmen homerooms are devoid of Big Sibs. “We’ll hear from teachers that no Big Sibs came to homeroom today or only three come consistently,” Pedrick said.</p><p>Under the restructured program, Big Sib Chairs will no longer be assigned to a specific homeroom. Instead, they will each oversee a batch of homerooms and provide direct guidance to homeroom leaders. Additionally, homeroom teachers may be asked to report any Big Sib absences to the guidance office.</p><p>Both the guidance office and the Big Sib Chairs recognize that Little Sibs often face issues that are beyond the scope of another student. In these instances it is important that the Big Sibs have a close connection with their Little Sibs’ guidance counselors so that they can pass on any larger issues. To promote this, most Little Sib homerooms will have at least one Big Sib who shares their guidance counselor.</p><p>To ensure that freshmen foster a relationship with their guidance counselor, instead of giving a generic introduction to their entire homeroom during Camp Stuy, counselors will hold smaller meetings in the hallway. “We want the guidance counselors to not only [...] go to each homeroom and talk [at Camp Stuy,] but to talk to specific kids in homeroom. For example, pull out two or three [students] at a time to really introduce themselves and make themselves approachable,” Li said.</p><p>Camp Stuy, along with the Big Sib Little Sib Dance, is part of the frenzy of activity that the Big Sib Program opens up with each year. But by the end of the first marking period, apathy seeps into the program. To combat this, the new Big Sib Chairs are planning to hold events outside of school throughout the year.</p><p>“Homeroom is only once every two weeks generally for 15 minutes. We’re going to try to maximize the opportunities we have face to face with our Little Sibs. I know some homerooms [already] have little bubble tea meetups and things like that. [Now,] not only one homeroom is doing it, but all homerooms are doing it,” Big Sib Chair Charlotte Ruhl said.</p><p>However, a more effective way for Big Sibs and Little Sibs to bond would be through weekly, rather than sporadic, homerooms, which both would be required to attend. Homerooms should not only be a time to hand out forms, but a place for students to interact. In the past, Big Sib Chairs have spoken with faculty about having more frequent homerooms, but they have not been cooperative in helping underclassmen assimilate.</p><p>The guidance office’s involvement in restructuring the program has obvious benefits, but historically the Big Sib program has been entirely student-run. This autonomy is part of what makes Stuyvesant a unique school, and student-based leadership makes Big Sibs truly welcoming and inspiring. We hope the Big Sib Chairs continue to be the driving force behind the program.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:33:54.579813	8	1	Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names.

178	﻿“Thirteen Reasons Why”… Or Why Not: A Point/Counterpoint	thirteen-reasons-why-or-why-not-a-point-counterpoint	<p>Based on Jay Asher’s novel published in 2007, Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why,” aired on March 31, 2017, emphasizes how serious teenage bullying and suicide can be. Viewers follow Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette), a junior attending Liberty High School, as he listens to the 13 cassette tapes Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford) left before she took her own life. She dedicates each tape to a different person who drove her closer to her decision to commit suicide. On the tapes, she recalls instances of sexual harassment, rape, slut-shaming, and vicious rumors.</p><p>The anti-bullying message behind “Thirteen Reasons Why” is prominent and powerful, but the way it is presented is controversial. Some believe that the series glorifies suicide, presenting it as an ‘easy way out’ to teenagers going through troubles similar to Hannah’s. So, is “Thirteen Reasons Why” a revolutionary, powerful show, or is the backlash well-deserved?</p><p><b>Point: Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why” adeptly tackles the subject of suicide and makes for a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece.</b></p><p>There was a lot of buzz when Netflix released season one of “Thirteen Reasons Why.” With American actress and singer Selena Gomez as its producer, it's not surprising that so many people were excited to watch the series. The series has much more than a famous celebrity producer, however. “Thirteen Reasons Why” tells the riveting, tragic story of Hannah Baker by walking us through the cassette tapes she left behind as an explanation for her suicide.</p><p>While suicide is a heavy subject, the plot of “Thirteen Reasons Why” weaves in Hannah Baker’s star-crossed lover to lighten the plot. It was a smart decision on the part of the writers and directors to focus more on this relationship than Hannah's suicide. Had “Thirteen Reasons Why” been solely about Hannah’s suicide, it would have been too dark for most audiences to stomach.</p><p>Clay’s presence gives viewers something to hold onto and root for throughout the show, which may have kept them watching despite the graphic and upsetting scenes. Clay’s heartbreak may also have an impact on viewers who may be having thoughts of suicide because it shows the impact suicide can have on loved ones. Many people contemplating suicide believe that the world would be better off without them, and Clay’s regret over failing to tell Hannah he loves her while she was still alive may give people hope that they do mean something to someone.</p><p>There is a lot of uproar over the graphic scenes in the series, especially the scene of Hannah Baker’s suicide. Some believe that since these scenes can be triggering and should not have been included. However, a trigger warning is included at the beginning of each episode that contains a graphic scene, with a brief description of what exactly may be triggering. Those who continue watching do so at their own discretion.</p><p>In addition, the graphic portrayal of Hannah’s suicide, including her mother’s initial reaction to finding her body, conveys a more powerful message because it emanates the permanence of suicide and the effect it can have on loved ones.</p><p>When Hannah seeks help from her school guidance counselor, Mr. Porter (Derek Luke), he dismisses her problems and does not offer any substantial emotional support. People criticize this depiction of Mr. Porter and believe it to be unfair, but it is true to reality. People contemplating suicide usually do seek some sort of help; according to Mental Health America, 64 percent of people who attempt suicide visit a doctor the month before their attempt.</p><p>This reality will allow schools and health professionals to expand the resources available to teenagers with depression or suicidal thoughts. As screenwriter Nic Sheff puts it, “Facing these issues head-on—talking about them, being open about them—will always be our best defense against losing another life.”</p><p>The message behind “Thirteen Reasons Why” goes beyond a simple “don’t bully.” It sheds light on the harm bystanders can cause. There were many instances of bystanders in the series. For example, Hannah and Justin Foley (Brandon Flynn) stayed silent while Bryce Walker (Justin Prentice) raped Jessica Davis (Alisha Boe) at a party. Clay didn’t say anything when the slut-shaming rumors of Hannah spread around the school.</p><p>The truth is, silence is just as harmful as bullying; if you’re not against the bully, you’re often complicit.</p><p><b>Counterpoint: Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why” treats the subjects of mental illness and suicide irresponsibly, destroying all of the show’s potential.</b></p><p>There is no argument that “Thirteen Reasons Why” does not bring attention to suicide; however, this attention may cause more harm than good. There is a reason why suicide awareness groups across the nation have expressed concerns about the show.</p><p>There are many problems with the show—the biggest one being the lack of attention on mental disorders and illnesses. Whether the directors or writers of the show avoided the subject of mental illness on purpose or not, it comes off as careless and irresponsible for them to miss such a prominent factor in Hannah’s downfall.</p><p>Furthermore, “Thirteen Reasons Why” idealizes and glorifies suicide. As Dan Reidenberg, the executive director for Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE), says, “Young people are going to over-identify with Hannah in the series, and we actually may see more suicides as a result of this.”</p><p>The show depicts Hannah committing suicide as a form of revenge, since the series shows her leaving the tapes behind for the people who hurt her to show them what they did to her. This is detrimental and undermining to people who struggle from suicidal urges, as entertainment journal “The Edge” notes, “It perpetuates a ‘suicide as revenge’ mentality, a message of getting justice against everyone who wronged her.”</p><p>I’m not one to victim-blame because it is certain that Hannah has had an impossibly rough time from her peers that she blames in her tapes, but the show almost vilifies her. The tapes she records explaining why she killed herself will make viewers question exactly why she chose to do that.</p><p>There are many graphic scenes in the show which can trigger people who have had similar experiences or have thought about doing the things Hannah has done. Though some people favor these scenes because they’re realistic, they almost seem like a how-to guide to suicide when the show explicitly shows how Hannah takes her own life.</p><p>A Stuyvesant junior who would prefer to be left anonymous feels strongly about these graphic scenes. When asked about her experience watching said scenes, she said, “[I have suffered from having suicidal thoughts] for most of middle school up until the end of sophomore year. [The show] deals with really dark subject matter and visualizes the very dark thoughts I’ve been working on and off therapy to repress; for instance, in Hannah’s bathtub scene, [I had] the exact thought and [seeing] it on screen prompted a panic attack.” She agrees that it is important for the show to expose teenagers to this topic, but the way it is portrayed isn’t actually providing anything for youth suicide prevention. Instead, it may cause a potential relapse.</p><p>Unlike the novel, the Netflix original is anything but sophisticated. While the 288-page book has depth and truthfully depicts belligerent school environments and teenage anxiety, the show stretches the plot line across 13 one-hour long episodes so much that the meaning becomes lost. Instead of focusing on Hannah and her mental health, the plot focuses more on the relationship between her and Clay. This relationship is stretched so thin that it becomes flimsy and transparent.</p><p>The writers and directors of “Thirteen Reasons Why” claim that its purpose is to prevent teenage suicide and show those who are struggling that there are people out there who can help. However, the show does nothing to elaborate more on that. Hannah does not talk to a professional until the last episode, where he dismisses her and doesn’t suggest any treatment at all. She also does not talk to her parents, which is common for many who are suffering from suicidal thoughts.</p><p>If this series is really supposed to show that it’s okay to talk about one’s said thoughts, Hannah should have done this to possibly influence many others who are watching. The poor image of adults in helping Hannah is damaging and enforces the idea that they don’t understand and won’t ever listen to a suicidal teenager’s thoughts. We see her loved ones failing to help her, which ultimately leads to her decision to take her own life.</p><p>Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why” has good intentions, but it comes off as irresponsible and hurtful. Maybe if the directors had depicted mental illnesses more realistically, the series would have had a different outcome.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:34:29.220888	17	1	
179	﻿“Dear Evan Hansen” Conveys A Powerful And Modern Message	dear-evan-hansen-conveys-a-powerful-and-modern-message	<p>When hearing the words “musical theater,” “Dear Evan Hansen” isn’t what would typically come to mind. In an industry that is usually associated with tap dancing and extravagant musical numbers, the show tells a poignant and unique story that touches on subjects such as bullying, suicide, and mental illness, having audiences crying 20 minutes into the first act. The production lets viewers laugh, sob, and learn that many others face similar struggles.</p><p>The musical, directed by Michael Greif, centers around 17-year-old outsider Evan Hansen (Ben Platt), who suffers from social anxiety and is advised by his therapist to write letters to himself in order to improve his confidence. Evan prints out a letter at school, which is spotted by Connor Murphy (Mike Faist), Evan’s tormenter and equally alienated classmate, who takes the letter home after mockingly signing the cast on Evan’s arm.</p><p>Evan returns to school to be informed by Connor’s parents that, shortly after their interaction, Connor committed suicide with Evan’s letter in his pocket. With the note giving Connor’s parents the false belief that Evan was one of their son’s only friends, Evan is integrated into the Murphy family and begins to form a relationship with Connor’s sister, Zoe, whom he has long admired.</p><p>Composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul tell the show’s story through songs that illustrate Evan’s thought process when interacting with others, his relationship with his frequently absent mother, and the shock of Evan and those around him when it is revealed that Evan was not close with Connor. The songs narrate every event, from Evan nervously making up a story about time he spent with Connor to Evan finally realizing that he doesn’t have to put up a front to be accepted. The pop-rock style of the show’s score differs from classic show tunes, yet exhibits the emotions of high school students and their families in an honest and thought-provoking way.</p><p>“Waving Through A Window,” one of the show’s more well-known songs, describes how Evan is affected by social anxiety with lines such as “Give them no reason to stare / No slipping up if you slip away / So I’ve got nothing to share / No, I’ve got nothing to say” that narrate how Evan goes about his day-to-day life.</p><p>The musical’s songs range from upbeat and catchy, like “Sincerely, Me,” to more lyrical and truthful, as in “Words Fail,” in which Evan tries to explain to Connor’s parents the reasons behind him letting them believe that he and Connor were friends. The well-written lyrics were accompanied by strong singing and music that stuck with viewers throughout the performance. Judging by the amount of tears at intermission, the score definitely struck a chord with the audience.</p><p>The powerful message in “Dear Evan Hansen” is communicated not only by musical numbers, but by believable and passionate acting. Ben Platt hit the nail on the head with every aspect of his portrayal of Evan Hansen, down to the blinking and fluttering that accompany Evan’s anxiety.</p><p>Platt, with Laura Dreyfuss’s quirky yet charming take on Zoe, make for a believable couple that the audience could relate to. Rachel Bay Jones is perfectly fit for the role of Evan’s mother, starting out the show by doting and being supportive in “Anybody Have A Map?” and revealing the genuine and straightforward side of her in “So Big/So Small.”</p><p>Kristolyn Lloyd provides comic relief as the dedicated and studious Alana, Connor’s self-proclaimed “closest acquaintance,” and co-president of the “Connor Project,” an organization centered around remembering Connor and essentially convincing Connor’s parents that Evan cares about their son.</p><p>The rest of the cast’s performances, such as Jennifer Laura Thompson and John Dossett as Connor’s parents, Will Roland as Evan’s sarcastic family friend, and Mike Faist as Connor, help tie the musical together by creating a varied range of characters that make the show feel believable.</p><p>“Dear Evan Hansen” is also endearing through its visual aspects. The cast moves on and offstage on set pieces that allow for smooth transitions. The stage’s backdrop was a set of screens that reflected the plot and highlighted different aspects of the performance. As the “Connor Project” gains an internet presence, the set flashes images of social media profiles and comments praising Evan and Alana’s work.</p><p>With social networking being such a huge aspect of our culture today, it’s refreshing to see a show that revolves so heavily around interactions on the internet. These images also change to correspond with Evan’s emotions at different points in the show. This gives another dimension to the performance, helps the audience follow along with the plot, and punctuates significant scenes. During “Waving Through A Window,” texts and pictures flash by quickly to convey desperation and urgency.</p><p>What attracts so many people to the production is how viewers can see themselves onstage. The musical sheds light on issues such as suicide, dysfunctional family relationships, and mental illnesses that are extremely prevalent in today’s society, but are also often misrepresented.</p><p>Most people have probably felt like outsiders at some point in time, especially in high school. By adding details such as Evan taking medication for his anxiety and Connor not being able to form a relationship with his parents, the show stays true to reality and allows the audience members to feel as if their own stories are being told.</p><p>The show reaches out to audiences by reminding us that no one deserves to be forgotten, and you are not alone. While the most of the characters in the show are high school students, audiences will be able to see themselves in “Dear Evan Hansen,” regardless of age.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:35:19.476024	18	1	
180	﻿A Stuy Student’s Guide to Springtime Flicks	a-stuy-student-s-guide-to-springtime-flicks	<p>Whether you're planning a movie day with friends or just looking for a movie to watch, here’s a list of some spring-time flicks you may want to check out before they’re off the big screen.</p><p>Spring is the beginning of blockbuster season, but it’s also known as the time of the year when mediocre movies are put on the big screens, expected to come in and out of theaters without much attention. Despite the spring season usually lacking any Oscar-worthy releases, it’s still important to know what’s available to watch, no matter what the season; and who knows, maybe an Oscar film managed to sneak its way into a May release date. With that in mind, here are nine movies, ranging from blockbusters to slight obscurities, that you may want to go check out during the warm months before the summer rolls in!</p><p><b>Beauty and the Beast</b></p><p><i>March 17, 2017</i></p><p>This was perhaps one of the most anticipated spring-season flicks of this year: a real-life adaptation of the Disney animated movie “Beauty and the Beast” (1991), one of three animated films in history to have been nominated for Best Picture. This new adaptation stars Emma Watson as the widely-admired Disney bookworm, Belle. It has been praised for its beautiful set and costume design, having brought to life Belle’s famous yellow ballroom gown, as well as the grandiose character design of each of the objects. Though it came out almost two months ago, tickets are still being sold, so I recommend you catch it in theaters before it leaves the big screen for good.</p><p><b>Gifted</b></p><p><i>April 7, 2017</i></p><p>This movie is about a little girl with a brain all Stuyvesant students wish they had. An unparalleled genius in mathematics, “Gifted” follows the tug-of-war battle for a young girl’s life between her down-to-Earth uncle (Chris Evans) and his incredibly ambitious mother (Lindsay Duncan). Most people know Chris Evans as the honorable Avengers leader, Captain America, so watching him take on this vulnerable, average human role should be a nice change of pace for most viewers.</p><p><b>Fate of the Furious</b></p><p><i>April 14, 2017</i></p><p>The Fast and Furious movies are famous for their over-the-top car chases, with each scene in each new movie release crazier than the last. However, these movies are also heavily built on the family-like connections each of the characters have with one another. It’s a combination of the closeness between the characters and their unquenchable hunger for driving cars that causes them to get stuck in a situation crazier than the last. Though I don’t have high expectations for this movie ( car chases can only get so crazy before they become too painfully unrealistic to watch), if you find joy in watching the insanely impossible occur on-screen, go get yourself a ticket for this flick.</p><p><b>Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer</b></p><p><i>April 14, 2017</i></p><p>Sometimes, the most obscure movie can be the one most packed with surprises; after all, what expectations could you have for something you’ve never heard of? With this springtime indie film comes Richard Gere, a man famous for his role as a classy rich boy in the ‘90s film “Pretty Woman,” playing Norman, a devious middleman who’s made a living as a forgettable fixer. When Norman makes arrangements with someone on the rise to fame, the world begins to learn his name, and knowledge of his existence and schemes soon rise with his unwanted popularity, threatening the life he’s lived comfortably for so long. If you’re looking to get away from the Hollywood blockbuster and trying something out of the norm, why not go and give this flick a try?</p><p><b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</b></p><p><i>May 5, 2017</i></p><p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” was one of Marvel’s most highly regarded films, with a music score unrivaled by any action movie before it. Three years after this movie was first released, Marvel fans can rush back to the cinemas to watch Star-Lord, Gamora, Draxx, Rocket Racoon, and everyone’s favorite baby tree, Groot, go on another crazy adventure across the galaxy, but not without some sweet new tunes to accompany them! If you plan to go and watch this film, get ready to see some new faces and old rivals join the Guardian squad, alongside a highly-anticipated character reveal that everyone who’s seen the original film has been waiting for.</p><p><b>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</b></p><p><i>May 12, 2017</i></p><p>Everyone knows the story of King Arthur and the sword in the stone. However, this year, filmmakers have decided to take a dark turn on this classic tale. Starring Charlie Hunnam from “Sons of Anarchy” (2011-2014) and Jude Law from the “Sherlock” (2009, 2011) films, “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” turns the good-and-bad heroic tale of King Arthur into something far more complex, making the responsibility that comes with pulling the sword from the stone a much heavier burden than that of the original version. With this film comes a whole new twist on a myth that has been retold the same way for centuries, so go and see for yourself which version of the story you prefer.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b></p><p><i>May 19, 2017</i></p><p>Whether or not you're a fan of the “Alien” franchise, this film is one of the biggest topics of conversation of the spring season. The sequel to “Prometheus” (2012), the first of the “Alien” prequel films, this film takes place before any aliens caused problems for Sigourney Weaver and her crew. When an expedition group made up of couples capable of colonization are sent to explore the outer reaches of space for a planet suitable for life beyond Earth, they happen to stumble upon a desolate planet that appears to be an uninhabited paradise. Of course, nothing goes as planned, and these unlucky explorers become the second crew to encounter one of the most terrifying sci-fi monstrosities to ever be put to the big screen.</p><p><b>Wakefield</b></p><p><i>May 19, 2017</i></p><p>Bryan Cranston, renowned Emmy-winning actor from “Breaking Bad” (2009-2013), stars in “Wakefield,” an independent movie that looks like it has enough potential to get the attention of the Academy this year. Following a man who runs away from his life in a most unusual way, the movie follows him watching from his attic as the ones he loved try and forget he ever existed. Simultaneously, Wakefield tries his best to unshackle himself from the restraints of the life he once lived. The number of things he must let go before he can truly be free may be too much for him to toss away completely, but only the movie can tell you just how far he’s willing to go to be free.</p><p><b>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</b></p><p><i>May 26, 2017</i></p><p>Johnny Depp is back as everyone’s favorite pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, in the latest “Pirates of the Caribbean” film! As is the case with all “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, one of Sparrow’s past enemies is back to take revenge, with powers more terrifying than any of the antagonists before it (they wouldn’t make it any other way). With the recent Pirates movies yet to be released, I can’t say I have many expectations for this film, except that Jack Sparrow will hopefully be as hilarious as he always is, finding even crazier ways to get himself out of trouble and making the movie worth a watch at least once just for the laughs.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:35:52.144402	13	1	
181	﻿Toubab Art and the Mechanized Artist	toubab-art-and-the-mechanized-artist	<p>Along the beach by the Point des Almadies, the westernmost point of Africa and a popular tourist destination, you'll find loads of the same kind of art, jewelry, and clothing scattered around.</p><p>One vendor sells batik (a dyeing technique in which wax is used to prevent parts of the fabric from being dyed) dresses with stripes, jewelry made of coconut shells and pretty plastic beads, and woven multicolored baskets with a cover and vertical grip bought from women working in a supplier workshop not far away. Two tents down, someone is selling the same thing, plus tiny wooden elephants, turtles, cats, and a variety of other animals that he sculpted himself, but no batik dresses. On the next block, someone is selling all of that, plus bags made of bright, quilt-like fabric with “African prints.”</p><p>Why, in markets and popular tourist locations, are dozens of vendors selling exactly the same wares, while original art is hard to come by?</p><p>Almadies is Dakar’s hub of expatriates and tourists, especially Americans and Europeans, or “toubabs,” the loosely thrown-around Wolof term for a white person or Westerner. (I'm of Indian descent, but I, too, am a toubab because I’m light-skinned enough and apparently have the air of an American.) Toubabs are the crowd that always seem to be hunting down Senegalese art.</p><p>Art has always been present in Senegalese culture—they wear batik, have decorative woodwork at home, keep fruit in woven baskets. However, today’s lower-middle class Senegalese homes and wardrobes house far less Senegalese art than those of expatriates. It makes sense that tourists and expatriates buy things that they see as characteristic of the culture they came to.</p><p>Like in the United States, you need to go into a formal gallery or studio to find original work. The tourist industry’s demand for what it sees as traditional makes it appealing for certain artists to branch away from Senegal’s fine artists into a uniform line of work. Artists became artisans. Wood sculptors became carpenters. Couturiers became tailors. The art feels handmade, but lacks uniqueness. Many toubab artists today can’t afford to be creative, think it safer not to, or simply have never thought about it.</p><p>In the Village Artisanal of Dakar farther downtown, Aliou Kanté sculpts daily alongside hundreds of other artists, smoothing small wooden beads, animal figurines, and decorative statuettes, as he has since 1985. He comes from a family of artists, and was brought to the Village by his older brother. His family is Laobei, a caste of woodworkers, of Guinean origin.</p><p>For centuries, strictly Laobeis made wooden sculptures. The Laobei artist Cheikh Sow, who also works in the Village making koras and sabar drums, explains that only they may cut down trees and know the incantations to do so without disturbing the spirits that the trees host. While the caste system is no longer present in Senegal, many Laobeis continue their family’s traditional profession, and they currently constitute the vast majority of woodworkers in Senegal.</p><p>Kanté loves his profession and wants to continue it, but explained that it poses large difficulties. Artists like him rely on business that comes almost entirely from tourists, but with the decreasing visibility and popularity of the Village Artisanal among tourists, due to the construction of a new road that gives drivers less of an incentive to drive by the Village, he earns little. He works for a full day but is forced to sell to retailers who buy at meager rates. Art sellers, like many in the stalls in Almadies, interact directly with often wealthier tourists and earn much more.</p><p>While he dreams of exposing his work in Europe and having it distributed throughout the world, I was surprised to hear that he doesn’t aspire to make any stylistic changes (I would expect international success to require more originality). He, however, has been working in the Village since 1985—meaning 32 years of unchanged style.</p><p>As it were, there are an immense number of artists in the field with Kanté who have developed a financial reliance on the chain of sellers and tourists, because it is an immediate solution for the lack of money in their pockets; change and creativity are risky.</p><p>It is detrimental that the art in demand among toubabs is stagnant, because it encourages many artists with large potentials to cater to a specific taste instead of working from personal inspiration. If expressing oneself is a risk, then it’s a part of artists’ job description.</p><p>Toubab artists need to have the opportunity to innovate; dependence on the tourism industry shouldn’t limit them. If Donatello or Rodin were confined to tiny animal figurines, the arts would have suffered. There is a danger in artists who want to express themselves feeling muted in an unhealthy industry that makes art a restrictive, menial labor.</p><p>What the industry needs is respect for those behind the beautiful culture that made it possible. It would be great if customers, especially toubabs, bought from the source. Prices must do justice to the time and labor exerted to make the art possible—artists ought to create unions, and the Senegalese government ought to lay down stronger legislation regulating labor (the arts are among many fields that this would benefit). Senegal will in the years to come, inshallah.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:36:26.209247	4	1	Dakar artists’ dependence on sales through tourism limits their originality.
182	﻿Five-Minute Trends	five-minute-trends	<p>Oh, New York, filled with the stench of success and $1.00 pizza. Evolution in the city that never sleeps means constantly innovating and experimenting with the art of food. Cookie dough, once relegated to the bottom of the freezer and the occasional baking expenditure, has now become the basis for a classy, hot pink cafe in Greenwich Village. Cake appears on towering waffle stacks in a perfect defiance of a healthy breakfast. Bagels are dyed in funky colors, a reflection of the hippie 1960s and of our overwhelming need to be unicorns. Here are some of the desserts New York famously offers:</p><p><b>Red Velvet WTF Waffles:</b></p><p>Prize for most original and glorious creation since Michelangelo's David goes to Clinton Hall’s Red Velvet WTF Waffles. For $15, you can enjoy the layered version of the junk food aisle in Clinton Hall, a spacious Battery Park restaurant. The Red Velvet Waffle is really three individual red velvet waffles stacked on top of each other with layers of ice cream, raspberry sauce, oreos, whipped cream, and more stuff in between. A slice of red velvet cake delicately perches at the top of the confection. Towering, incredibly rich, and dripping with gooey wonder, Red Velvet WTF Waffles are worth the hype and will surely leave your taste buds shook.</p><p><b>Rainbow Bagels:</b></p><p>Found on just about all of Instagram, rainbow bagels are the food equivalent of a Lisa Frank sticker set. Strongly resembling colorful play-doh rolled together, rainbows bagels are overly sweet, vaguely fruit-loopy, and offered with a variety of whimsical cream cheese fillings—from funfetti to Fruity Pebbles. Though created by The Bagel Store over 15 years ago, they’ve blown up fairly recently, praised for the experience and photo opportunity they provide more than the taste. You can get them at 754 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn, for only the cost of a long wait and about $7.00 per bagel. Or perhaps skip the train ride and go to Zucker’s instead.</p><p><b>Cookie Dough:</b></p><p>News alert: your favorite, but possibly dangerous, mid-baking snack has been turned into a  safe-to-eat dessert that can be be consumed shamelessly. Cookie Do NYC, a cheerful, Pinterest- worthy bakery found at 550 LaGuardia Place, is an homage to cookie dough in all its forms—in scoops, waffle cones, ice-cream sandwich, baked cookies and cupcakes, as pie filling, sundaes and more. Scooped cookie dough ($4 for a single scoop) is offered in 13 classic cookie flavors, ranging from commando (plain) to brownie batter to peanut butter snickerdoodle. With Cookie Do NYC regularly opening to long lines that wrap around the block, cookie dough is clearly in high demand. Driving its appeal is the innovation of a classic dessert that brings back nostalgic childhood memories and a sweet, smooth flavor. The verdict: drop in, but in the case of a mile-long line, hit up your local supermarket instead.</p><p><b>Deep Fried Oreo Pizza:</b></p><p>Eat away your computer science grade with the unexpectedly perfect combination of greasy goodness in the form of deep fried oreo pizza. Created in a relaxed, retro-style Krave It in Bayside, Queens, batter-covered oreos are deep fried to golden perfection, baked on top of a cheese pizza, and generously topped with powdered sugar and oreo crumbs. The perfect mix of textures—crunchy, sweet oreos combined with gooey cheese—makes the pizza ($16 per pie) pass as both a guilty pleasure dessert and a hearty meal. Not as popular as it should be, deep fried oreo pizza is the quintessential New York food.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:36:59.780969	14	1	New York aka trendsetter of a city offers many innovative, exciting desserts.
384	﻿Featuring the New Electives	featuring-the-new-electives	<p>Filming the world through the perspective of a moving bicycle; learning the secrets of the IC, CIA, and NSA; transcribing music from one instrument onto the guitar. At Stuy, there is an elective for almost anything you can think of. This year, new electives have been created, and each one of them is bound to fill students with a sense of newfound appreciation.</p><p><h4>The Physics of Video Production</h4></p><p>Informally, The Physics of Video Production class is also known as “Introduction To Screen Studies.” Though it is taught by physics teacher Thomas Miner, the class does not revolve entirely around physics. Rather, it studies how physics is a part of film history and film theory, delving into everything from the smartphones of the present to the cinema screens of the past.</p><p>At first glance, it may seem odd that a physics teacher would create a class about film, as physics and film seem unrelated. For Miner, however, this interest in film isn’t random. In college, he also majored in Film Studies. After he accepted a teaching position at Stuyvesant, Miner jumped at the opportunity to teach a class that was oriented toward his passion for film.</p><p>Students view film material—from short films to animations, and everything in between—and then create film projects of their own. “I want students to become better practitioners of creating content. I think everyone is in charge of writing and producing [his or her] own films; essentially, if you think about Snapchat, or Instagram, or any kind of social media, we’re all basically the stars of our own films,” Miner explained.</p><p>In order to discover what aspects of film theory everyday observations reveal, the class often has group discussions. “We were talking about how the camera sees differently, how it has this alien perspective on us, on the world, and how his camera could see the world spinning,” Miner said. “A student had a film where he attached his phone to a bicycle wheel and it was just a beautiful whirlwind of colors and shapes.”</p><p>Miner’s passion for film helps students understand the importance of the moving image and encourages them to think outside the box. “This idea of assembling images that create meaning in the mind of the viewer—the essence of cinema is this montage of two images together. The collision of these two images creates an idea in the head of the viewer; that idea in and of itself is cinema,” Miner said.</p><p><h4>History of Intelligence</h4></p><p>After taking parental leave, Kerry Trainor has returned to Stuyvesant to teach his History of Intelligence elective during the spring semester. “I believe that, whenever possible, teachers should strive to teach content they are passionate about. I have always been fascinated and interested in the history of intelligence,” said Trainor in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Trainor wrote his Master Thesis on Congressional Oversight of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). It was while researching his thesis that Trainor noticed the number of college-level courses on the US Intelligence Community (IC) and later the lack thereof at Stuyvesant. This inspired him to create this elective. “I worked with several historians of Intelligence and Security Studies who helped me put it together. I then went through the process of getting it approved and was honored when our administration gave me the green light on it. I am very grateful to [Assistant Principal of Social Studies Jennifer] Suri, [former Principal Jie] Zhang, and the rest of the Cabinet,” Trainor said.</p><p>The curriculum Trainor designed covers the history behind the IC with a focus on the CIA , FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation), and the NSA (National Security Agency). In addition to their history, the class will also analyze how these spy agencies work and exactly what this work entails. Regarding what his students will take away from his elective, Trainor said, “Students will come away [with] a nuanced understanding of the role of largely secret intelligence agencies in an open democracy.”</p><p>The implications of the world of intelligence are vast: intelligence agencies are integral to foreign policy and the business world. As for whether this class will be continued in the future, as long as there is student demand, Trainor plans on teaching it.</p><p><h4>Guitar Appreciation</h4></p><p>The Music Department is offering a new class that teaches the same curriculum of the required Music Appreciation course, except with an intensive guitar unit. Guitar Appreciation is taught exclusively by music teacher Harold Stephan, who created the class when he needed to teach one of music teacher Liliya Shamazov’s classes, so she could teach another chorus period. He explained, “We thought it would be a great opportunity. It would be nice to offer something different.”</p><p>Stephan has experience teaching students how to play the guitar. “I taught one year of middle school, my first year teaching, where I had a guitar class already going. So it’s something that I felt comfortable doing,” he said. Stephan’s connection to the organization Little Kids Rock allowed him to get a grant for 50 free guitars. “Once I had that piece in place, it was a no-brainer to go ahead with it and create the curriculum to go along with it.”</p><p>The curriculum focuses on specific music pieces already taught in the Music Appreciation course, such as Ode to Joy and Pachelbel's Canon, that could be transposed to a guitar key. “They'll play along and hopefully remember it in a way that they wouldn’t necessarily remember it by sitting in a lecture type class,” he said.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not they play guitar, students can apply for the class or be randomly selected. He explained how he was surprised by the positive feedback the class received and the collaborative efforts of the students. “One of the nice things is that the kids who play guitar help the kids who don't play guitar to try to get everybody up to speed faster. Actually, I've been impressed by how fast the students have learned to play the basic chord shapes and strum along,” he said.</p><p>“The first time that I counted ‘1, 2, 3, C chord,’ everybody played the chord. It sounded like an ensemble C chord. Even if it wasn’t a piece a music, it was part of a piece of music,” he said, recalling his favorite moment of the year. “To me, that was the most gratifying thing, just to be able to hear kids who never played before to be able to participate and feel like they’re part of an ensemble.”</p><p>Because of his experience in the music industry, he is passionate about implementing more new classes in Stuyvesant. He is currently working on getting a grant for 30 electronic music workstations for a music production class. “I would like Stuyvesant to be the epicenter of songwriting and production at high levels in a high school environment in NYC, and possibly beyond,” Stephan said. In addition, he contacted the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences to start a summer camp program for Stuyvesant students. “I'd really love to be able to teach electronic music production, contemporary songwriting, classes like that,” he said</p><p><br/>Whether your love for learning lies in the arts, the humanities, the sciences, or something completely different, electives give us insight into topics that intrigue those who take them. Maybe you could find yourself in one of these specific elective classrooms in the future.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:17:53.874225	2018-01-23 02:17:54.03465	3	1	Covering the new and interesting elective options that are being offered for the 2017-2018 autumn and spring semesters.

195	﻿Meet Stuyvesant’s Newest Teachers	meet-stuyvesant-s-newest-teachers	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>At the start of every semester, walking into a classroom and seeing a new teacher can be daunting. But for some teachers, the first day can be just as intimidating because it is a completely new experience for them as well. This year, Stuyvesant has gotten many promising new additions to the teacher staff. Here are some of their stories, from when they were inspired to start teaching to their hopes for their Stuyvesant experience.</p><p><b>Sunwoo, Chemistry</b>,<i> by Senjuti Gayen</i></p><p>Patrick Sunwoo is the newest addition to the Chemistry department here at Stuyvesant High School. Before coming here, Sunwoo taught at a high school in the Bronx for four and a half years. He taught various subjects, including Chemistry, Forensic Science, and AP Chemistry. “Pretty much everything science-related under the sun,” Sunwoo said.</p><p>Sunwoo’s decision to come to Stuyvesant was largely influenced by his friends at college; they had graduated from Stuyvesant and had told him great things about the school. From what he had heard about Stuyvesant’s reputation, he believed that its students would challenge him as an educator.</p><p>In the few weeks that Sunwoo has taught at Stuyvesant so far, he revealed, “I was blown away by how curious the students were and how much they already knew.” He recalled that at least two or three students already knew how to balance chemical equations before he even taught the lesson. He liked how students interacted with the teachers and how they were supportive of one another. “I guess you could say I like the vibe here,” Sunwoo summarized with a bright smile on his face.</p><p><b>Miner, Physics and Video Production</b>,<i> by Cathy Cai</i></p><p>Students lounging on the eighth floor may see a younger, unfamiliar face walking down the hallway: it’s the new physics teacher, Thomas Miner.</p><p>Miner’s interest with physics started long before he pursued teaching. “I had a great physics teacher in high school who was so inspirational,” Miner explained. “I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of physics and philosophy, answering big questions about existence—what we’re doing here and where we came from.”</p><p>Prior to coming to Stuy, Miner taught at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn. “It was my third year teaching,” Miner explained, “and I was asked, ‘Do you want to do more AP Physics?’ and I said, ‘No, I’m done with all this left-brain stuff.’” Although he loved physics, he wanted to take a break. Thus, Miner went back to graduate school and looked for something that was creative or interesting.</p><p>It was then that he found his passion in film. “I tried a film studies class, where we watched a film for every decade through American Cinema History and really loved it,” Miner said. His goal, however, when he graduated, was always to go back to teaching physics, and film, at a better school than John Dewey. The opportunity to teach at Stuyvesant as a physics teacher was an offer he couldn’t pass up.</p><p>But Miner didn’t forget his love for film. In addition to physics, Miner is teaching a new screen studies elective. “It’s called ‘The Physics of Video Production,’” Miner explained. “It’s very much film theory, film history, and the analysis of film. How we get to where we are with technology today? What is the progression of the medium from the technological base?”</p><p>Miner was clear to draw the distinction between film and physics, however. “Everything is physics, right?” he said. “But it’s not a physics class necessarily. We don’t go in depths of how cameras or sensors work.” It’s more similar to art history, in which students learn the rules of shot composition and how the process of editing has been applied and changed through time.</p><p>“It’s a lot of work planning [and] grading, but I’m happy to do it. It’s nice to see that students want to do it too,” Miner continued. “I get emails at two in the morning. I love how they care so much. I love how they’re constantly asking questions and seeking feedback. And I love the role I get to play in that.”</p><p><b>Lindemulder, French and German</b>,<i> by Amara Shein</i></p><p>For the first time in years, Miguel Ramirez is not the sole French teacher. With the addition of the new Level IV French Culture course, it would be against DOE regulations for Ramirez to be responsible for all of them.  That’s where Rebecca Lindemulder comes in, carrying textbooks and papers while she enthusiastically waits outside Ramirez’s fourth period French III class. She is both prepared and eager to teach French and German.</p><p>Lindemulder’s passion for foreign culture stems back to her own high school career. “I really liked [French] and I even went to France a couple of different times. I love it,” she explained.  During her travels, Lindemulder fell in love with the culture, food, and the little things such as simple relaxation that France offered her.  “It’s just something that I really enjoyed.  I liked being able to communicate in another language as well, so I wanted to be able to impart that ability to others and inspire others the same [way].”</p><p>Lindemulder pursued her master’s degree by teaching German in Germany. Afterwards, she taught the language at a high school in New Jersey. However, she wasn’t able to spread her passion for French culture when she taught there. When she found an online posting for a French and German teaching position at Stuyvesant, her curiosity led her to learn more about the school.</p><p>“I came here and was amazed to see how friendly Mr. Oliveri was and what a nice school this is,” Lindemulder said with a smile. As for the students, Lindemulder is in awe. “The kids here are phenomenal in how they’re engaged and attentive [during] the lessons. They really want to learn, and they’re really curious and want to show me what they already know,” she said. “I love what they’re bringing to the table. I think it makes a big difference.”</p><p>By exploring foreign culture and food rather than solely teaching words and grammar, she hopes to make her classes fun for her students. “Everybody raves about Stuyvesant and how much fun it is to be here, and that’s exactly what I’m experiencing.”</p><p><b>Esposito, English</b>,<i> by Maya Mitrasinovic</i></p><p>Dan Esposito had an unorthodox English-related journey before joining Stuyvesant’s English department. Even before college, Esposito knew he wanted to do something related to the subject, but teaching wasn’t on his radar yet. He became a food writer, doing freelance work and working in kitchens. Then, the perfect opportunity arose: a job as a taster for an import-export company. He stayed with the company writing flavor descriptions for a little over a year, until it began to feel like an average office job—but with more food. He felt that he had gotten so far away from his original love of words, and he wanted a job where he could see his work paying off. Teaching fit perfectly into that category, so he decided to change his career path and embark on this new journey.</p><p>So far, Stuyvesant has lived up to Esposito’s expectations. He grew up in Westchester and was a member of Iona Prep’s Speech and Debate team, through which he competed with Stuyvesant students, so he already had experience with the school. The fondness stayed with him for all these years, so when the opportunity arose, he decided to apply for a teaching job here.</p><p>The amazing things he had heard from Stuyvesant students years ago stayed true: his new students are excited and ready to learn, and as they engage with the material, Esposito can re-engage with himself. And he loves it.</p><p>Esposito is excited to see how the rest of the school year plays out. He hopes that he’ll be able to build good relationships with his students and that they’ll learn things they never expected to learn. When prompted, Esposito described himself as “interested.”  “I think a lot of people describe themselves as interesting, but I think it’s always more important to be interested in what’s going on around you,” he explained. He’s already learned so much from his students in such a short time, and with his interest in both their ideas and their success, he’s sure to have a great year.</p><p><b>Kincaid, English</b>,<i> by Maya Mitrasinovic</i></p><p>It had been eleven years since Kate Kincaid was a Stuyvesant teacher, and she couldn’t wait to come back. She started her career in English with a job in editing and proposal writing, and after attaining a graduate degree in creative writing, she decided that she wanted to teach.</p><p>Her first teaching job was at a middle school in Spanish Harlem as an academic intervention teacher (individually assisting students with learning a new skill or building strength in a skill), while she was substitute teaching at Stuyvesant. At Stuyvesant, she met [Assistant Principal of English Eric] Grossman, who called her as soon as an official teaching position in the department opened up. She stayed at Stuyvesant for a year and a half before going on maternity leave. Once her youngest kids entered first grade, she knew that she wanted to return, and was lucky enough to find a position open. “It feels like coming back home,” she gushed.</p><p>Kincaid feels that though Stuyvesant hasn’t changed very much in the past years, she has changed, and that makes her experience as a teacher very different. She thinks that she is a better teacher now, due mainly to the facts that she is better with kids and is more comfortable in her abilities than she was eleven years ago.</p><p>This is not to say that Kincaid’s transition has been stress-free. It’s hard to not be there to put her kids on the school bus in the morning, but she feels like she’s beginning to get into a routine again.</p><p>She’s working on being more organized, but still true to herself. “I don’t try to pretend I’m organized. I come in as I am, like, ‘this is me,’” she said. Kincaid wants to make sure that all her students are engaged—not just the “superstars” and big participators. Her openness in the classroom helps to create a welcoming community, for both her bright-eyed, eager freshmen and her worn-out, but sophisticated, seniors.</p><p><b>Staley, English</b>,<i> by Paulina Klubok</i></p><p>Judd Staley, one of Stuyvesant’s new English teachers, decided to become a teacher because of an advertisement on the subway. Though he had always loved literature and excelled in English, majoring in it college, Staley didn’t know what profession to pursue after college.</p><p>Since then, Staley has taught in four NYC Department of Education schools. His last school, the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation in the Bronx, where Staley had been for the last five years, had a very different atmosphere from that of Stuyvesant. “In the Bronx, I was dealing with a lot of severely underprivileged kids—not that the kids here are privileged, but it seems like their needs are different, and it’s a big adjustment,” Staley said.</p><p>Despite the changes. Staley said his first week was great, citing his colleagues as his favorite part. “I really love the English department here and am enjoying getting to know everyone and learning a lot from what other teachers are doing,” Staley shared.</p><p>Staley, however, is very aware of the pressures placed on Stuyvesant students and hopes that in his first year, he can help his students deal with the stress. Staley hopes to find his place at Stuy this year—to get used to the rhythm and expectations of the school—and he aspires to “hopefully next year, really know what I’m gonna do,” he said.</p><p><b>Stuzin, English</b>,<i> by Vincent Jiang</i></p><p>For some students, Lauren Stuzin is a comforting familiar face. Once a student teacher for English teacher Megan Weller, Stuzin has returned as a full-time teacher, now with her own European Literature and American Literature classes.</p><p>For most of her life, Stuzin had been surrounded by English. Her father loved classical literature and often read Shakespeare to her as a child. Her love for English only grew in high school when her English teacher inspired her to read Shakespeare, which became her favorite period of literature. She then majored in English as a Cornell undergraduate, serving as the editor-in-chief of a student publication there, before pursuing her master’s degree at Columbia Teacher’s College.</p><p>Aside from her love of English, Stuzin also gravitated toward working with younger students; from being a ski instructor to a camp counselor, every job she had involved working with kids. “Being with kids makes life better,” she said.</p><p>Her first teaching experience was at I.S. 289, a middle school near Stuyvesant. Though it was fun, she discovered that she enjoyed the high school setting more.</p><p>Stuzin had her first taste of Stuyvesant as Weller’s student teacher, but when Weller unexpectedly went on maternity leave three weeks earlier than expected, Stuzin found herself thrust into leading the class without a guiding mentor. “First day, I was really overwhelmed,” she said. “I was just sweating the whole day, running around, trying to organize myself, and I think I started new books with all my classes that day; it was very hectic.”</p><p>As she grew more comfortable, however, she grew to love the school and the students here, leading to her seeking a full-time position. On the first day of the new year, she admitted she was a bit nervous, but she quickly grew accustomed to the rush of running her own classes.</p><p>Stuzin is looking forward to teaching “Macbeth,” her favorite Shakespeare play. “I would like to inspire any students that I have who may feel like English is not their thing, because I think it’s everybody’s thing; I think it’s relevant to everyone, reading and writing both,” she said.</p>	108	3	f	2017-10-17 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 08:08:44.845204	3	1	Mini-profiles on the new teachers

Onlookers somehow managed to be even more shocked, however, when Damesek said yes. “After seeing her hide in a closet for 45 minutes to just scream at some kids for making out, I knew she was the one for me,” Espinosa said.</p><p>The happy couple now lives in a timeshare in Nantucket with their seven children: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 00:53:18.928668	5	1	After Randi Damesek accepts Michael Espinosa’s promposal, the two end up getting married and living in suburban Nantucket with their seven children and their minivan.
249	﻿The College Applications Feedback Loop	the-college-applications-feedback-loop	<p>College is baked into the Stuyvesant culture from students’ first steps into the building. In the freshman survey conducted by The Spectator, almost 70 percent of freshmen predicted they will attend an elite college (Ivy League, Stanford, etc.). Perhaps the drive comes naturally from the types of hard-working, academically motivated students that Stuyvesant attracts. As well, a majority of students come from Asian and Eastern European backgrounds, where parents place immense academic pressure on their children to attend a top-notch university.</p><p>To make matters worse, the administration does little to create a holistic environment. In a school such as Stuyvesant with a reputation for high-achieving students, GPA becomes many students’ defining factor, determining their eligibility for AP classes and role in the Stuyvesant community (ARISTA, Big Sib etc.). Every student is tasked with upholding the “Stuyvesant standard” of attending an elite university, when in reality success is determined by more than the reputation of your college. The result is a positive feedback loop of anxiety and competition, with everyone having a tunnel vision of educational success focused on college.</p><p><b>Mentality of Utility</b></p><p>Against the intense pressures of college applications, many seniors try to use the Early Decision and Action processes as strategically as possible. Strategizing encourages seniors to apply early to prestigious colleges they feel more likely to be accepted by, but that may not be the best fit for them. The mentality at Stuyvesant is that students will be happiest at the most prestigious college possible, whereas applying Early Action or Early Decision should actually be a decision made out of a passion for the school itself.</p><p>Asian and Eastern European parents reinforce this mentality by placing emphasis on their conception of an elite school, namely the Ivy Leagues. Some students are also unable to visit the campuses of every university, and as a result apply to well-known names based on brand and their parents’ influence, rather than finding a university that fulfills their aspirations.</p><p>The advice given is to emphasize aspects of yourself that differentiate you from the majority of the student body at that school. You might apply early to MIT, because as a humanities-focused student, you stand out against other Stuyvesant applicants. Or you might apply early to the University of Chicago even if it’s not your top school, so that you can have it as your “backup” when you apply to an Ivy League later.</p><p>However, strategizing may not be solely the result of the overly competitive nature of Stuyvesant. The college admissions system encourages this type of approach just as much as our classmates and college counselors do. Far from being a truly egalitarian system, colleges employ an opaque rubric that encourages students to try to out-smart.</p><p>This emphasis on gaming the system undermines the entire purpose of the college application process. By viewing college admissions as something to be conquered, students often sacrifice the chance to gain admission to the school or program that best suits them.</p><p>Furthermore, because seniors’ applications are directly compared with those of their peers, they feel pitted against each other to the point where every classmate is a direct threat. The quality of a college application becomes completely relative so that students are fixated on their peers’ applications instead of their own. It has come to the point where students make lists detailing who is applying to the same colleges so that they can scope out their competition and make personal decisions based on their perceived chances of gaining acceptance. Other students will hesitate to let their friends edit their essays, fearing that they will purposely make unhelpful or damaging comments in order to gain an advantage themselves. And the seniors who do get into their schools early and then choose to submit more applications by the regular deadline will often receive backlash from other students who feel that they are “stealing” their spots.</p><p><b>Breaking the Loop</b></p><p>Stuyvesant students will always be focused on getting a leg up in the college admissions process. However, it is important that students make an effort to stop the positive feedback loop through which the frenzy of college-based conversations and decisions encourages even more anxiety.</p><p>College admissions are not a zero-sum game: if someone gets into one of your top choices, you don’t lose out. Your admission doesn’t come at someone else’s expense, and colleges are balancing their student body based on the whole applicant pool, not just the applicants from Stuyvesant. The paranoia surrounding how others are doing and where they are applying is, in the end, just paranoia.</p><p>When top-tier colleges can easily fill a second class with equally qualified applicants, the candidates who are accepted are determined by somewhat unknown qualities, or by luck. Much of the application components that colleges assess in their admissions decisions—GPA, standardized test scores, and letters of recommendation—are out of your and your peers’ control by senior year. The best strategy is to simply focus on making the remaining aspects of your application the best they can be, rather than being distracted by your classmates. Strategizing and obsessing over how others are doing in the process will do nothing for you.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-01 20:32:04.792933	8	1	
404	﻿Death of a Senior	death-of-a-senior	<p>Autopsy Report</p><p><h5>Description:</h5></p><p>A body was found under a stack of papers on December 31, 2017.</p><p><h5>External Examination:</h5></p><p>The body is that of a male in his young adulthood. It is suspected that the deceased is a senior at Stuyvesant High School. The body weighs 153 pounds, measuring 71 inches from crown to sole. The residual hair on scalp is black with spots missing from sides. It seems like the decedent’s hair was torn out. The skin of the body exhibits wrinkles characteristic of someone in his late 30s during a midlife crisis. Deceased’s nose is abnormally flattened. Further analysis indicates this is not due to blunt trauma but due to prolonged sleeping on a flat surface, like a textbook. Eyes could not be analyzed due to excessive swelling of eye bags.</p><p><h5>Clothing:</h5></p><p>The deceased is wearing a faux Supreme Box Logo. The printed text reads, “Stuylin’.” Blood has stained the box logo to a darker shade of red. Multiple coffee stains can be found on the deceased’s clothing. Examination of the pristine Adidas Yeezy Boost shoes reveals that the deceased most likely tried to safeguard his shoes.</p><p><h5>Description of Injury:</h5></p><p>The wounds are located on the left side of the chest, 14 inches below the top of the head and three inches from the side of the body. The wounds are deep cuts created by a smooth edge. The wounds measure a tenth of an inch deep. This corresponds with the length and shape of the college brochures found at the crime scene.</p><p>The deceased also exhibits bruising and broken ribs. At the crime scene, the victim was found buried beneath piles of A4 copy paper. Many of these sheets had titles like “Why I Love Your University.”</p><p><h5>Conclusion</h5></p><p>This is a fatal wound associated with excessive bleeding as a result of multiple cut wounds. It also seems that the deceased suffered from crushed ribs before death. It is likely that he was flipping through too many college brochures in a sleep-deprived state. He accidentally cut himself with the papers and was buried by his college applications, unable to call for help.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:51:01.336462	2018-01-23 02:51:01.466728	5	1

409	﻿Snooping in the Lab Gone Wrong: Students Find Santa’s Reindeer Hidden Away	snooping-in-the-lab-gone-wrong-students-find-santa-s-reindeer-hidden-away	<p>The biology department has seemingly gotten bored of frogs and moved on to new victims. Last week, several students, including sophomore Richard Kim, began exploring the lab rooms. The students picked the lock to a room using a paperclip and entered for purely innocent reasons. Upon first glance, everything seemed ordinary. After a careful search involving the throwing of boxes, they found a package labeled “FRAGILE—LIVE ANIMAL.” What they found inside was absolutely shocking.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Kim. “I thought it was just one of the many whale specimens the department keeps stowed away, until I noticed that signature red nose. It was Rudolph!” The other students confirmed that the biology department had in fact, managed to get their hands on one of Santa’s precious reindeer and performed a dissection. The reason for the biology department’s possession of this famous animal is unknown, but some students think they know the answer.</p><p>“It all makes sense now,” Kim said. “Obviously, Santa can’t deliver any of his presents without them.It was all a plot to make sure we would spend our entire break writing 2500 word essays about the mating patterns of Cucumis Sativus instead of being festive and opening Christmas presents. As for the dissection, that’s just the biology department being the biology department.”</p><p>The students had a funeral for the poor reindeer, burning a pyre in Battery Park. However, the occurrence only brings up the question of what else the biology department has in store.

287	﻿Democrats and Women: Making the Same Mistake	democrats-and-women-making-the-same-mistake	<p>But Democrats are failing to see the obvious—sexual assault is still sexual assault.</p><p>Upwards of 40 actresses have come forth to condemn acclaimed film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault in the last couple of months. Inspired by the willingness of these A-listers to speak out, dozens of women have been stepping forward as victims, accusing famous men such as Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, and many more of sexual assault and harassment. Yet, the Democratic party—which claims to be firmly opposed to sexual assault—has had a totally underwhelming response.</p><p>The infamous “Weinstein scandal” is hardly the first time Democrats have disappointed in the face of outrage in America. Preventing sexual harassment continues to be a cause championed by politicians since the Clinton era, when former president Bill Clinton had an infamous affair with an office intern, Monica Lewinsky. Democrats such as Bill de Blasio and Kirsten Gillibrand claim that if the same scandal had occurred today, Clinton would be forced to resign.</p><p>But it’s much easier to make these statements about an ex-president whose governing days are well in the past than about a politician who can sway the future of the Democratic party. A new wave of allegations have surfaced in the past several weeks blaming Senator Al Franken for the inappropriate groping of four women. Franken has done little to deny the accusations, telling the Minneapolis Star Tribune “I don’t remember these photographs, I don’t. This is not something I would intentionally do.”</p><p>To be sure, Republicans aren’t in the clear either. Senatorial candidate Roy Moore has been similarly plagued by accusations just before a crucial election. The 70-year-old Alabama native continues to deny any sexual misconduct as growing numbers of women are coming forth to condemn him for past behaviors, such as forcibly groping and kissing minors.</p><p>The important distinction here lies with the reaction: immediately after the first stone was thrown in Moore’s direction, Democrats came out of the woodwork to demand he step aside from the race. Even Republicans ( Ted Cruz, John McCain, Paul Ryan) immediately called for Moore to give up his chance at the seat, chastising everything from Moore’s actions to his character to his ethics.</p><p>Al Franken, however, has been granted immunity to criticism from Democrats because of his politics, revealing the hypocrisy in their movement. Of course, he’s gotten the customary slap on the wrist from his party, and a small influx of criticisms, but nowhere near the extent of the backlash Moore’s received. Even though Moore was the same man who, ironically, gained fame after his refusal to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from a government building, his alleged convictions should remain separate from his actions.</p><p>Yet, even Franken’s fellow party members remained relatively silent, and the female cast from his time on SNL went so far as to defend Franken in an open letter. A recent article by the Washington Post, titled “I’m a Feminist. I Study Rape Culture. And I Don’t Want Al Franken to Resign,” even claims, “Sexual harassment and assault are simply too widespread for Democrats to respond to Franken’s offense with only Franken in mind.” Franken—because of his earlier advocacy for sexual assault victims—is essentially being given a free pass by Democrats. Excuses ranging from his viability as a candidate to comparatively less egregious behavior in comparison to Moore’s all diminish the fault in Franken’s actions. They feed off his prior status as an “ally” of women to pardon the hypocrisy of his own past.</p><p>And though Franken recently resigned, he walked away from the Senate while commenting on the “irony” of his situation, saying, “I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office...” The Senator, who built his career on pointing out moral depravity in the Republican party, refuses to acknowledge it within himself. Franken’s departure in disgrace was followed by retorts toward his accusers and claims of “unfairness.” Actions truly speak louder than words, and Franken’s commentary drowned out any attempts (or lack thereof) to right his past.</p><p>Yet Democrats continue making such sizable mistakes. About two decades after Clinton’s scandal, his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, ran for president. The crux of her campaign was progressing women’s rights, yet her behavior suggested an opposite intent.</p><p>After her husband fell under heavy scrutiny, Hillary viciously attacked all the women who accused him of harassment, even calling Lewinsky a “narcissistic loony toon” and deeming all similar accusations as completely fabricated. In Clinton’s earlier days as a lawyer, she helped acquit a child rapist while fully believing he was guilty, as later revealed when she laughed about the case in a taped interview.</p><p>Even recently, Hillary accepted donations from countries such as Saudi Arabia (which alone gave upward of $25 million) that commit glaring human rights abuses against women. Yet the Democratic party has remained silent throughout all of these transgressions, with many politicians proudly having backed Hillary as a candidate and as a human being. As long as her morals shone bright in the ballot box, and there was a prospect of an establishment Democrat holding office, there seemed little incentive for further investigation.</p><p>Democrats are failing to see the obvious: sexual assault is still sexual assault. And if they want to set a proper precedent, they must denounce all men convicted of it and all people who continue to defend it, despite political beliefs. They must address the threat of “false allegations,” allowing for their investigation and certainly for lawmakers to make their case. But if they hold validity—which, more often than not, these allegations do—it’s high time for Democrats to stop defending accused men because of their political standing.</p><p>If Democrats want to maintain the trust of voters, then they need to stop this perpetual cycle of suppression within their own party.

305	﻿“Humans of New York: The Series”	humans-of-new-york-the-series	<p>When you watch Brandon Stanton’s “Humans of New York: The Series” for a minute, the most normal of people become as interesting to you as they are to themselves.</p><p>The most iconic of all of Stanton’s work as we know it are the Facebook and Instagram posts of grandfathers who have lived many lives, four-year-old microfashionistas clad in vivid colors, driven entrepreneurs, and teenage subway performers whose art is their living. In the HONY Series, these characters are reincarnated in film with their raspy, timid, or boisterous voices and idiosyncrasies in movement, allowing another layer of personality to transcend the limitations of a computer screen.</p><p>“HONY: The Series” continues the intimate features of outstanding and average, thoughtful people. One episode of Stanton’s newest venture features a guitarist who shares his darkest fear of “getting too old to be appreciated” and then plays a song. It makes us realize that we hide this same fear while a newfound appreciation of this musician blooms within us: we don't want him to ever be or feel too old.</p><p>A preteen remarks, “You’re gonna outgrow everything, eventually. You’re just gonna lose everything. I just don’t wanna let go,” and makes us nostalgic for everything we've outgrown or if we're young, everything we will soon outgrow.</p><p>An old lady draped in pink, sitting on her stoop, refuses to disclose anything about her life and adds with sass, “If I made a movie of my life, I would win 500 awards. Not 100, 500.”</p><p>If these people were captured in photographs, we would not hear the first man's guitar, the meditation in the kid's voice as he contemplates the right wording, or the distinctive attitude of the woman.</p><p>Stanton establishes throughout that all people are artists in their own right, be it through their words, their profession, their dress, or some recounted creative endeavor from decades past. The Series reestablishes this, while further humanizing subjects through the recordings.</p><p>Stanton's experimentation with new content and medium is nothing new—he periodically undertakes new endeavors to spice up his work. In the past, he expanded beyond New York City and traveled to 20 diverse countries, such as India, Iraq, Ukraine, and Uganda. He has also compiled his many encounters into New York Times bestselling books.</p><p>With millions of supporters already following his page—hundreds, if not thousands, from our very own Stuyvesant High School—the Series has a high bar to meet. In going to another country, the different cultures and people were new and interesting, but his role as an interviewer remained the same. In his book, the medium was still essentially photography, so it made sense to see similar content and formatting to what we do on a computer screen. Venturing into film, however, demanded something more.</p><p>“HONY: The Series” should be something more raw and distinctive in its representation of New Yorkers than HONY photography. So much can be done with film as a medium. It offers the power of a more complete story—it ties together different people, different ends. It can have a more compelling and apparent plot than any photograph or caption, and it allows for more character development. The Series, however, doesn’t fully realize film’s potential to tell cohesive, overarching stories, and is, instead, closer to being an extension of the photographic medium.</p><p>Each episode of the Series is based on a theme overflowing with human relevance: help, stardom, parenting, time, or home. Every story has a strong connection to this one-word theme. The episode “Help” features a businessman learning to do the little deeds he could for people. Another explores the enrichment of the life of an elderly man paired with a volunteer by a Nazi victims organization through their shared love of dance. The final example is of a man whose dog has always been there for him, and of whom he is ready to let go.</p><p>Though these topics are relevant, the individual stories within each episode, while all addressing the same themes, are insufficiently linked to one another. It’s like a patchwork quilt where everything is the same material, but the designs don’t complement one another. Stanton initially succeeds in intriguing us with a short profound segment, a metaphor, or an oddity. Some of the appeal, however, dies by the end of the 15-minute long segments. We need a reason to watch 15 minutes of a continuous clip, rather than the shorter videoclips plastered on social media.</p><p>Many of the episodes are still powerful. “Help,” for example, is one of my favorites, but more for the fact that each individual story is affective, rather than the video’s overall cohesion. The lack of a plot, or some other clear intrigue, is likely a reason that the views on these episodes on Facebook have fallen from seven to eight million views on early videos to half the amount on later videos. The episodes can be very meaningful, and watching them should feel less tedious.</p><p>Though the content may lack excitement, the cinematography of the HONY Series is beautiful, combining profiles and direct views of speakers’ faces with time lapses of crowds passing over subway staircases, of the NYC skyline at dusk through night, or of the scintillating lights of Times Square, overlaid with R&B beats.</p><p>“Humans of New York: The Series” is a beautiful piece of artwork. We find bolder personality by not only reading, but hearing voices. Nonetheless, it could capitalize more on the use of film as a medium and on the continuity of a lengthy video to create something as beautiful and more captivating. If HONY is going to be something new, why not embrace its newness?</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 22:14:57.234691	29	1	Brandon Stanton’s “Humans of New York: The Series” Facebook show is beautiful, but relatively uninteresting—we could have expected more from filmed work.
283	﻿Textbooks and Pointe Shoes: The Secret Life of Dr. Greenwald	textbooks-and-pointe-shoes-the-secret-life-of-dr-greenwald	<p>“You know, there’s something magical about the beauty of ballet,” describes history teacher Dr. Lisa Greenwald. Before teaching young students about history, she was a student learning ballet. She still dances ballet, but in a modified and less intense format. However, her experiences dancing ballet have affected her life in a large way, and now, she reflects on her life with ballet.</p><p><b>What sparked your interest in ballet?</b></p><p>What sparked my interest in ballet were two things: my mother took me to a creative movement class when I was about four. I got to run around the studio and pretend I was a butterfly or a rainbow. Then, she took me to see The Nutcracker at Lincoln Center, and I said, “I want to be like that.”</p><p><b>Did ballet classes live up to its competitive environment stereotype? Can you trust anyone?</b></p><p>There’s competition everywhere. Indeed it’s a very “only the top dancers get in anywhere [environment],” but you’d be surprised at how much camaraderie there is. In a performance, 99 percent of all ballet dancers are in the background, so the chances that you’re going to be a principal dancer are very few. But even if you’re a principal dancer, you have to dance with other people. The only way you can study in a school for hours a day with the same people is for them to be your family, to work together, and enjoy dancing together. My daughter’s a dancer, and when she’s on stage, she absolutely loves it, because she’s exchanging glances and communicating with everybody else onstage.</p><p><b>How did it feel going from regular ballet shoes to pointe shoes? Was it a turning point in your life?</b></p><p>Lots of girls want to put on pointe shoes, because they look really magical, and you get to stand on your toes. Only, that hurts. And it particularly hurt in those days. Technology has improved things, so nowadays, there’s all sorts of materials that you can put in your shoes, and even the shoes themselves have evolved. In order to really dance well on your toes, you need to do it all the time. I did it sometimes, but it wasn’t every day for two hours to three hours a day, and that's what dancers who are practicing to become professionals do every day. My daughter dances on pointe every day, and her feet are incredibly strong. I always say that her feet should be registered as a lethal weapon. It’s meant to look magical on stage, but you could be in excruciating pain with a smile on your face.</p><p><b>How did it feel to be on stage and to perform in front of a live audience?</b></p><p>Being on stage is a strange thing. If you’re really on stage and you’re surrounded by stage lights, you generally look out and it’s black, and that can be very intimidating, to just see the blackness all around you. I don’t think I ever got used to that sense, because I didn’t perform enough, and I never got used to it. But my daughter, who performs in multiple performances every year, loves that. For her, coming onto the stage in the flood of light, darkness all around, that just lights her up. For me, I felt almost at sea, or too vulnerable. But again, that’s about discipline. If you do it all the time, you get used to it. And I just didn’t do it enough to get used to it.</p><p><b>How did ballet classes change you as a person or impact you as a teacher?</b></p><p>They changed me enormously. I think this goes for anybody who studies any kind of art form seriously: you know that the only way to get good at that [art] is to drill it intensely. You also know that what you put in, you get out. It means that if you want to just enjoy dancing with other people and be pretty good at it, then you have to practice it somewhat, but you don’t have to practice it five hours a day. If you want to be the best ballet dancer, then yes, you have to practice six to seven days a week, all day. It is a very visceral experience. And I think that’s a lesson for life: you get what you put into it.</p><p>The other thing that it taught me, which goes against the grain of a lot of high school education, is that direct teaching from teachers is enormously valuable. Your teachers are the experts: they model [ballet] and show it to you. And it made me have an enormous appreciation for my teachers. I enjoyed having teachers and showing them appreciation for what they gave me. You really learn how to show full appreciation and respect for your teachers when you’re studying something outside of the classroom.</p><p>It’s also funny because, in the end, I realized that [ballet classes impacted me], but not at the time. When I went to my ballet teacher’s memorial service, I listened to everyone talk about him, saying, “We loved when he did this; we loved when he did that.” I thought, “Oh my goodness, those were things that I tried to bring to my classroom. They totally impacted the way I teach: the way I ask a lot of my students and try to give a lot. I really believe that my students can achieve a lot. I just have to help them get there, but I don't have this idea that some people are just dumb and some are just smart. I really don’t believe that.</p><p><b>Why did you choose to pursue a doctorate instead of pursuing a career in dance?</b></p><p>There are a bunch of reasons for that. In high school, I really enjoyed dancing ballet. I studied with really good ballet teachers and performed on occasion. It was very meaningful to me and to my life. But I did not practice enough to try to become a professional.</p><p>Also, I probably wouldn’t have physically been able to do it. Ballet has specific requirements. To be a professional, you need to have a degree of flexibility, and your feet have to be structured in such a way that you can withstand professional dancing.</p><p>Even in high school, I had a sense that over the long term, a more intellectual profession would be more satisfying. And the chances of my becoming a successful professional dancer were slim, so I wanted to go to college. A piece of me regretted not having tried to dance professionally because I loved dancing and because I don't like giving up on activities I've committed myself to, but I think I made the right choice.</p><p><b>Can you tell us more about your ballet experiences?</b></p><p>[My time in Paris] was such an important part of my life. I ended up learning French and living and breathing French. I spoke French all the time and spent my days reading French. I had many French friends who I still hold as my dearest friends. Most importantly, my eldest daughter was born in France, so I became a mother in France.</p><p>For immigrants and the first generation, you really live between two cultures. You straddle being an American but having another side: your culture of origin. I’m a third generation immigrant. My father's grandparents came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and spoke German and Yiddish. My mother's great-grandparents came from the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire (the only part of Russia where most Jews were allowed to live)—probably in what is present day Ukraine—but I'm not sure as I don't have the records and haven't had time to do the research yet. My parents were so Americanized that there was little from the Old World that they brought to me. So it was an incredible experience to live in another culture and speak in another language. You’re living in this other world that has different values and expectations. I became a mother in France, and my expectations of parenting were different than that of many New York moms.</p><p>In France, I took full advantage of everything a different culture had to offer. I went to museums; I studied with this ballet dancer from the Paris Opera; I went to theater and saw films; I traveled a lot around France and hung out with friends. I lived with my husband, [who] also spoke fluent French. He was a journalist who worked in France, so we really had a very meaningful life in a different country. That’s why I love this population of students at Stuy who speak different languages, have different experiences with different cultures, and move in and out of different languages without thinking about it. It was special for me then, so I appreciate it now.</p><p><b>What are your favorite and least favorite things about ballet?</b></p><p>Well, as a ballet teacher of mine used to say, “ballet is many things; comfortable is not one of them.” As I get older, it hurts, and because I don’t want to stop dancing, I’ve had to modify my dancing, so that I don’t hurt myself. That has been a sort of slow and painful process. About 10 years ago, I discovered I had a hip injury, and I thought I would never dance again. I actually thought I would never walk again properly and that I would never not have pain again, because that’s what a doctor had told me. Until I went to a physical therapist. And so, I remember saying to myself, “Oh my goodness, I can never dance again.” My physical therapist said, “Yes, you can. You just have to modify what you do”.</p><p>When she said that I thought, okay, I’m never going to complain again. I’m just going to do what I can do and not hurt myself. I just am happy when I can get through a ballet class without being in pain. Very low expectations, I know! But, there is something about ballet for me that I just come back to. I keep on thinking that I really need to stop this [ballet] soon, but what else can I do? And people will say, why don’t you just do modern dance? Why don’t you just do pilates? I’m just like, “meh.” I don’t want to exercise. You know, there’s something magical about the beauty of ballet and trying to have a beautiful line, to beautiful music, and trying to really express the music in your body in incredibly subtle ways using the motion of your body. I dance every week. It’s fun to take class with my daughter; I keep saying to her, “You can't stop taking ballet because then we won't be able to dance together.” I can’t figure out a substitute for ballet now, but I’m hoping it will come to me, and I’m hoping I won’t be in a situation where my body decides I need to stop.</p><p><b>If you were to go back in time, would you keep the experiences, or which part of the experience would you change?</b></p><p>If I could go back in time, I would probably have not taken my ballet studies as much for granted. I think I probably would have done more but then I would have become a different person. I wouldn't have done the other things that I did. I probably would not have become a professional dancer. I could've become a failed ballet dancer.</p><p><b>How did you react to failure when you were dancing?</b></p><p>It’s a very intense place. There is no room for being a cry baby. You pick yourself up and brush yourself off. I used to have exercise-induced asthma when I was a kid, and so I would sometimes gulp air, and my instructor would make fun of me and say I looked like a fish. What was I going to do? Cry? I mean, it just makes you tough and resilient. It makes you able to absorb criticism constructively and move on and not take it into the core of yourself. You say to yourself, “Oh, he or she is correcting what I’m doing, not who I am. They might not even care about who I am. They are there to make dancers.” I think that’s an excellent lesson that goes back for hundreds of years. You are not inventing things, you are a student, and once you become an expert or master, then you can go on to invent things. But you are studying a discipline, and I think studying a discipline is a very profound experience because it's bigger than you.</p><p><b>If you had to sum up “How To Ballet” in a few words, what would you say?</b></p><p>Discipline. Always working for perfection and understanding that is impossible, but working for it anyway. Just really appreciating the beauty of the movement. It’s not a sport, it’s an art. There are many girls who dance ballet nowadays where you just don’t see the art. You need to have the art, more than you need to have your leg next to your ear, more than the triple pirouette. You need the art, the aesthetics, the beauty of it. It takes a lot of hard work and discipline. Believe me, ballet dancers are not floating through air. It’s tough, tough, tough.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:15:37.011232	3	6	Before Dr. Greenwald was a teacher here at Stuy, she was a ballet student.

290	﻿Transforming Apathy to Awareness	transforming-apathy-to-awareness	<p>I’ve always been a feminist, even before I knew what the term “feminism” meant. I was never expected to act a certain way because I am a girl, and my parents made that known by treating me and my brother equally. To this day, I equate feminism to personal empowerment.</p><p>Yet 43 percent of men and women describe feminism as “angry,” and 30 percent as “outdated,” according to a 2016 Washington Post poll. These labels are some of the many misconceptions surrounding the fight for gender equality in the United States. Harassment, not just of gender, but on the basis of race, religion, and sexual orientation, is still a widespread issue in American schools. An effective way to battle such harassment is through awareness, specifically by instituting a mandatory gender studies course.</p><p>Gender studies is a field devoted to gender identity and representation. Intersectionality, or how people of different race, gender, and sexuality experience discrimination or oppression on different levels, plays a major part in this field. Topics covered in the course would range from feminism to LGBTQ+ history to racial discrimination to sexual harassment.</p><p>This course would deal with serious and sensitive issues. This class would strive for both an educational and accepting atmosphere. Unlike other classes, participation would not affect students’ grades, so that students who are shy or sensitive about the topic of gender would not feel pressured to speak out. Grades would instead be determined by a student’s attentiveness, whether they complete all homework, and whether they aim to apply the course to their everyday lives. The purpose of this course is for all students to become aware of the history of minorities and underrepresented groups, how far they’ve come, and how much there is still to be done in terms of reaching equality.</p><p>Gender studies needs to be mandatory in school to ensure that everyone, both male and female, understands equality. According to the same Washington Post poll, 50 percent of men do not identify as feminists. In every category, men were more withdrawn or opposed to feminism than women. Feminism affects women more than men, but the fight for gender equality will not reach its fullest potential if only women support it.</p><p>The class would emphasize the damaging effects of harassment. The ideas enforced by gender studies are just as important to victims of harassment as they are to harassers. While schools emphasize zero tolerance for harassment of any sort in society, students should also make the effort to respect their peers.</p><p>In one form or another, most students have experienced sexual or gender-based harassment. According to the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, 82 percent of surveyed LGBTQ+ students had previous bullying problems in school due to their sexuality in 2007. In 2010 to 2011, the American Association of University found that nearly half of surveyed students in grades seven to 12 had experienced sexual harassment. Additionally, the New York Daily News reported a 10 percent increase in 2016 to 2017 in bullying reports of students grades six to 12.</p><p>Schools should be able to address these issues with their student bodies, but it would be harder to understand harassment and make change if gender equality had not been previously and openly discussed. For example, some schools recommend guidance counselors to students who have experienced bullying. However, to spark a lasting change, schools should seek to stop the bullying from happening in the first place, rather than just comfort victims. With gender studies in school curriculums, students can become more aware of the parts that discrimination, sexism and racism play in everyday life and what can be done to decrease bullying from happening.</p><p>Stuyvesant High School should consider adding gender studies to its curriculum for freshmen. Gender studies is a crucial way of nurturing students, not only academically, but also personally. Not only should schools seek to prepare us for our future through core subjects, but also through the social necessities that impact the way we perceive our peers.</p><p>Schools have already begun to take action. In 2013, gender studies was introduced to the high school curriculum of Ontario, Canada. After taking note of prevalent sexual assault in the Toronto School District, five university students formed the Miss G Project and worked to have these important issues discussed in school. Josh Shier, a former student in one of Ontario’s high schools, remembers how this class improved his high school experience. “I was gay, dealing with a lot of bullying, and I had suicidal thoughts. Taking that course made me feel a little bit better about being different,” he said. “I feel like it was the only high school class I ever really learned anything in.”</p><p>Incorporating gender studies into high school will not drop harassment rates to zero percent. Yet depriving students of learning about social inequalities does nothing to help current harassment issues. Instead, this deprivation only perpetuates the idea that the problems we face among our peers in school are inevitable. This class is not a miracle cure, but it is a big step in the right direction of the society we want: a society where students are aware of the history behind issues that impact them daily. Schools have the responsibility to generate and uphold environments where students of any race, gender, and sexuality can feel safe.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 02:58:47.503263	2	6	Stuyvesant, like any other high school, has a responsibility to address student harassment issues through a gender studies course.
188	﻿Boys Who Code Club Disbanded	boys-who-code-club-disbanded	<p>The Boys Who Code Club, created just a week ago, was disbanded after members realized the multitude of similarities between their club and the rest of the computer science clubs in the country. Founded by freshman Sudat Khan, the club was created to empower boys to pursue computer science fields and had several dedicated members.</p><p>“We felt left out after seeing the multitude of girls-only computer science clubs and thought, ‘What was so special about them?’” Khan said. “If girls can have their own computer science clubs, why can’t we? We were shocked to learn that many computer science clubs already foster this mentality in their male population.”</p><p>After Boys Who Code was disbanded, former members joined other computer science clubs in hopes that they could continue to feel empowered against the overwhelming female majority; these clubs include the Hacking Club, the Coding Club, and the Cybersecurity Club. Some, however, have protested against Boys Who Code’s closing by joining Girls Who Code, a Stuyvesant club dedicated to teaching girls how to code. While seniors and co-Presidents Sarah Yoon and Stephanie Yoon are completely fine with it, the male members feel oppressed in the female-saturated environment.</p><p>“I didn’t understand why all the girls were so intimidated while I was there,” an anonymous male Girls Who Code member said. “These girls are all going to be welcomed to STEM fields with open arms while guys would be rejected. Reverse sexism is a thing, and to say that guys have it much easier than girls in STEM fields is completely false.”</p><p>The Student Union (SU) was saddened to learn that the newly-chartered club would be disbanding after only a week. “We wasted $700 on this club to buy new laptops for the boys,” SU Vice President Tahseen Chowdhury said. “This funding could have gone to the ‘I Have Created This Club to Look Good For College Club’ to buy new traffic cones instead.”</p><p>Still, Khan is dedicated to his cause, wanting to make sure that all men fight against societal pressure to go into a certain field and pursue something they are interested in. “I’m going to create a Boys Who Engineer Club soon,” Khan said. “That doesn’t exist yet, right?”</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:39:53.258997	5	1	The Boys Who Code Club disbanded due to their similarities with other computer science clubs.
190	﻿Tigers Clawing for Playoffs	tigers-clawing-for-playoffs	<p>Freshman Vishwaa Sofat stepped up to hit against the Thomas Edison bowler and eyed him up. Sofat then smacked the next ball for a six, similar to a home run in baseball, except worth six runs. He and the Tigers, Stuyvesant’s cricket team, cruised to their first victory of the season.</p><p>After defeating Thomas Edison High School for their first win of the season, the Tigers will look to carry the solid play over for the remainder of the season and put their rough start behind them. The team currently sits at 1-7, which is last in their Bronx/Manhattan Division.</p><p>However, the team has not lost hope, even with the tough beginning. “We usually start off a little rough but end much better, so the fight isn’t over yet,” said senior and co-captain Vijay Daopersaud, who bowled well against Thomas Edison and helped lead the Tigers to victory with two wickets.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Gurpreet Singh shared a similar sentiment: “We still have six more games to go, and I believe in this team to go out there and win,” he said. Neither the captains, nor the rest of the team, will give in with so much of the season left to play.</p><p>In order to improve, the team will need to quickly gain the experience and mentality that only comes with playing the game for a long time. Many new players have had to step up and fill the roles previously occupied by seniors. “We lost around seven starters this past season. All of them had at least three years of experience playing the sport,” Singh said.</p><p>One of the few bright spots on the hitting side of the game, Sofat has become a force with the bat. He has scored a combined 54 runs over six games and will look to add to that total as the season draws on. “He really stepped up and provided much needed stability for batting and bowling and keeping, something done by very few players in the league,” Daopersaud said.</p><p>A consistent problem for this team has been run production. Their highest output was the 83 they scored against Thomas Edison in their win, but after that the next highest is more than five runs less, and the team averages about 60 runs per game. Opponents, meanwhile, have surpassed the 100-run mark four times against Stuyvesant, and Dewitt Clinton piled on 257 in a blowout Tigers loss. If this team has a shot to bounce back, they will need their batsmen to step up.</p><p>With 14 juniors on this year’s active roster and only two seniors, expectations were high but tempered. Last year’s team finished with an 8-5 record and was third in the division, making it to the second round of the playoffs. However, this year’s Tigers roster is younger and less experienced. Even though many would call this a rebuilding year, the captains believe in their team. “There are benefits in having a young squad. They have more years ahead of them and they all have a ton of potential,” Singh said.</p><p>With the season just over half finished, the Tigers will need to greatly improve their record in order to try and qualify for the playoffs. While that is an extremely challenging task, this team has the personnel and leadership to go on a run.</p><p>However, even if they fall short, the team is in position to rebound next year, with a huge junior class and underclassmen that have been practicing and improving this season. Either way, the Tigers are in position to make noise in the league sooner rather than later.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 06:41:24.403307	24	1	The cricket team, after a rough 0-7 start to the season, will try to overcome the early season hole to close out strong.
191	﻿Girls Badminton Comes Up Short	girls-badminton-comes-up-short	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>With a 4-0 lead over Maspeth High School, Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity badminton team’s second doubles, comprised of senior and co-captain Yiqing Hu and sophomore Tracy Chang, swiftly defeated their opponents without dropping a set. This sent Stuyvesant into the quarterfinals of playoffs, where they would face Seward Park Campus, one of their toughest rivals of the season.</p><p>The team, after succumbing to a 3-2 loss at the hands of Seward, were eliminated from playoff contention on May 12. This ended their quest for an undefeated season, as they were 9-0 heading into the match (including their one prior playoff game).</p><p>The team dominated their competition in part because most teams are brand new, badminton being made a Public School Athletic League (PSAL) official sport just four years ago. “I feel really positive about the season. Both of our losses [against Seward] were quality losses for our teams,” coach Hugh Francis said.</p><p>This season, Stuyvesant defeated Seward Park Campus 3-2 in the fourth match of their season. This was the only one-point game Stuyvesant had in the regular season, fueling tension that led to the Seward Park victory in the playoffs.</p><p>This led to the rivalry between the two schools and will continue next season. Seward’s badminton team is known for its dedication and intensity both on and off the court. “Seward, the school we lost to, is devoted to the sport, as they even film the games and analyze them afterwards,” Hu said. Stuyvesant will try to match that intensity this coming offseason to exact their revenge next year.</p><p>Considering how Seward’s team prepares for its matches against other schools, Stuyvesant was able to make Seward really work for its wins. Although Seward had triumphed in two out of their three matches against Stuyvesant this year, Stuyvesant was able to pull away by a score of 3-2 early on. After the initial victory, Seward changed its strategy in order to win the second doubles games at the next two matches, turning the tables for a 3-2 win for them. “They switched out players for the later games,” Chang said.</p><p>Even with the tough loss at the end, this was still an incredibly successful season for the team. “Compared to previous years, we did much more conditioning and even running than we did in the past,” Hu said. The extra effort from the players led to more endurance as the season wore on, putting the team in a better place to succeed.</p><p>One revelation for the team has been the play of sophomore Lucy Wang. “[She was] able to become a starter as a third single,” Hu said. That play is crucial if Stuyvesant wants to come back and get revenge on Seward Park next year.</p><p>In order to do so, the team needs to work on their execution during games. “We should still improve on serving, especially not making serving errors, hitting in, and many badminton technical skills, such as netting and dropping,” Hu said.</p><p>“They were getting caught off balance—that’s something to work on,” coach Francis said. This comes with practice and repetition, so these abilities will hopefully translate into a deeper postseason run next season.</p><p>However, a repeat undefeated season will be difficult. Hu, along with three other seniors, will be gone next year. Younger players will have to step up and fill their places in order to keep competing. Hu remains confident in her teammates and their ability to lead the team to a better place in the playoffs next year. “I look forward to the team’s future,” she said.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 07:49:08.167923	24	1	The girls badminton team had an undefeated regular season but fell to Seward Park in the quarterfinal round to end their playoff run.
197	﻿What College Taught Me	what-college-taught-me	<p>On a Saturday in June, I overpacked my blue suitcase and boarded a train north to South Station in Massachusetts. On the train ride there, I read a paper about how pigs and baboons are now being used to grow organs that can be grafted into humans in a cross-species process called xenotransplantation.</p><p>For the next two weeks in Cambridge, I lived in Harvard University’s recently renovated Dunster Hall, where I taped photographs of my friends and family on the wall, dragged a white trash bag full of dirty clothes down to the basement where I learned how to do laundry, ran 9:45 p.m. coffee runs to the nearest CVS with my roommates in the rain, and occasionally had a bag of Swedish Fish from the vending machine for dinner, even though the Pre-College program offered a full meal plan.</p><p>I slipped on my slides with socks as I picked up a chocolate Pierce Brothers coffee at Annenberg Hall every morning and chose a spot in Widener Library. Surrounding me were other rising high school juniors and seniors with identical crimson lanyards around their necks, all equally as excited, nervous, and hyped up on sugar and whatever was floating around in the Cambridge air that day.</p><p>My classmates and I visited our professor’s lab and saw mice, zebrafish, and axolotls, met in the basement of Dunster for gossip and study sessions, and had an after-hours dance party at Chipotle. It was there that we fleshed out the applications of CRISPR and stem cell research techniques as we had burritos and my friend from India had his first-ever taco. We keep in contact to this day, so I know that Taco Boy has an AP Biology test on Thursday that he’s worried about and that my friend who lives in Central California had her first ever date on Friday and is excited about her second.</p><p>Living an abbreviated college life as a high school student was in some ways like xenotransplantation. Before I started the program, college seemed distant. I had the impression that you had to reach a certain level of intellectual and emotional maturity in order to handle life away from home, and the people who could claim this sort of sophistication at the age of 16 or 17 were an entirely different species. But when I received my acceptance e-mail and an extremely generous scholarship to attend the program, I decided to take the plunge and take on the identity of a Harvard student for two weeks. This is what I learned.</p><p>College-level work is demanding. In an e-mail interview, Jacqueline Newcomb, the director of the Pre-College program, explained that the Pre-College program’s courses “are in line with the Harvard curriculum. Typically, we ask our faculty to cover almost a semester of work in the two-weeks, but with the understanding that when teaching daily, there may not be time to assign as much reading and writing as a freshman seminar would have. We ask that they assign two to four hours of homework per night. However, since the majority of our faculty are teaching Harvard students in the academic year, they model their summer course including the rigor after their semester courses.” As someone who wants to go into science journalism, I opted for a course on regenerative medicine and stem cell research, and I definitely felt the weight of the academics.</p><p>As a junior at Stuyvesant, I am all too familiar with what it feels like to be overwhelmed by school. Oftentimes, my classmates and I wake up before the sun rises and come out of school after it sets, and while walking home in the dark some days, it feels like high school is all we have. College is supposed to remedy the occasionally toxic academic community that being surrounded by three thousand of New York City’s top students creates. These students become desperate to graduate and get into college before they burn out.</p><p>Though I wasn’t falling asleep on my walks to class or crying at my desk at night, I was consistently challenged by my work at Harvard and had to put in long hours. One night, sitting quietly on the duvet in my dorm room with the lamp on and the door slightly ajar, I realized that college won’t solve my problems.</p><p>My classmates and I are running through our high school years with our eyes closed. We sleep in intervals of REM cycles so that we can maximize our nap time, sneak study guides into weightlifting class, and retake the SAT to bump the score up by 20 points. I go to a school of absolutely brilliant kids who push themselves to incredible lengths, telling themselves that once they get into college, they can pull the brakes on life and slow down a little. But college, and other institutions of higher education, can’t work that magic.</p><p>I no longer see college as a means of escape from the academic pressures of high school. The Spectator’s survey of the graduating seniors this year revealed that nine out of 10 seniors plan on going into an academia-based profession. But while studying to become a doctor, engineer, or lawyer is an admirable endeavor, none of us will be able to handle the necessary years of higher education unless we prioritize mental health over academic success, no matter how much satisfaction being able to wear a Stuyvesant or Harvard hoodie brings.</p><p>Because of this realization, I also came to think about why I love being a student here. Even though waking up at four in the morning to study for my daily physics quizzes is painful, I find a collective joy in meeting my bleary-eyed classmates in the morning. We cry together when school gets tough, and we celebrate each other’s victories because each one of them is so precious. My math tests are worth around three-quarters of my grade, but I care more about the teacher in front of the room and the gracious, quirky, and funny person she is than the number on my report card. The other Spectator editors and I stay up late at night to edit articles, but seeing our writers improve and distributing the papers when they come and seeing the smudges of dark ink on our fingers are worth 100 sleepless nights.</p><p>I’ll admit I felt a fleeting moment of pride when I received my crimson lanyard, but Harvard’s program has left a much more important impression on me than pride in the name of a school or the beauty of the architecture. I will remember how I felt when I ate lunch with my professor, how excited I was to learn about stem cell research, how satisfied I was after my partner and I presented our final project on nerve cell regeneration, and how heartbroken I was to leave my friends. Each and every day brought its own challenges, but I found a kind of strength in the support of the academic environment and my classmates.</p><p>We’re now scattered all over the world, but we all keep a photo of each other on our phones or on our desks so that we can remember what it was like to live unabashedly unashamed lives as biology nerds in Cambridge. When I look at my photos from that summer, I see a smiling girl with an overpacked blue suitcase who’s not as much of a stranger to the idea of learning to be a smarter, kinder, and more curious person anymore. Here’s to hoping that she will always be that way.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:45:22.581053	3	1	My time at Harvard taught me about how I really should be thinking about school and measuring my success in it.
198	﻿There’s No Fall Without Pumpkin Spice	there-s-no-fall-without-pumpkin-spice	<p>Before there was pumpkin spice everything, there was fall; that dreadful time of the year when dirty, moist leaves get stuck on your shoes and you can’t tell if it’s summer or winter. However, in recent years, an autumn “aesthetic” has emerged: an obsession with “Instagram-able” fallen leaves, sweater weather, and of course, the pumpkin spice latte. So many chains offer the drink that all the choices might be overwhelming, so we visited three of the fastest-growing food chains in the U.S. to give you a glimpse of the taste of their pumpkin spice lattes.</p><p><b>Starbucks ($4.75)</b></p><p><i>5.0/5.0 stars </i></p><p>Our first stop was the Starbucks down Chambers Street that is situated right next to the 1, 2, and 3 train station. Starbucks, the epitome of the café industry, features a variety of drinks, from those in their ironically popular secret menus to the traditional espresso. Upon entering the dimly lit café, the harsh, busy mood of the city seemed to melt away. Customers sipped their drinks and typed away at their MacBooks while still more patiently waited for another warm round.</p><p>In a small cup with the signature Starbucks logo were our lattes, which smelled heavily of pumpkin spice seasoning. It was an adventure at first sip as the pumpkin spice latte topped with whipped cream led to a sweet tooth overload. When we had gotten over this, the spices characteristic of pumpkin spice lattes, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, produced a mouthwatering concoction. There has been little criticism for Starbucks’s drinks, and the same can be said for this fall variant. With the texture of an extremely creamy coffee and the aftertaste of a steaming cup of hot chocolate, it’s hard not to finish this drink within minutes unless you care to not burn your tongue.</p><p><b>Dunkin’ Donuts ($3.25)</b></p><p><i>2.5/5.0 Stars</i></p><p>Down by the A, C, and E trains is Dunkin’ Donuts, a brand most known for its array of glazed donuts and Munchkins. Although the store isn’t generally appreciated for its small selection of drinks and breakfast sandwiches, we headed to the small store to test its own take on the popular fall drink. As usual, the place was quiet and ordering lattes was a quick affair.</p><p>Dunkin’ Donuts’s pumpkin spice latte came in a dull brown cup and was as hot to the touch as it was to the tongue. When the burning sensation stopped, our first tastes were surprising. There was an excess of sugar and the latte tasted more like an Americano. Only near the bottom of the drink did we experience the spices that were usually offered in pumpkin spice lattes; however, they were so unabsorbed by the drink that the drink was quite disagreeable and led to a bad aftertaste.</p><p><b>McDonald’s ($2.00)</b></p><p><i>3.0/5.0 Stars</i></p><p>Just one short block from Stuyvesant itself, the popular fast-food chain is known for its inexpensive but questionable food and drink choices. Yet, the store is almost always booming with customers lining up to buy a cheap snack or meal. Characteristics of this McDonald’s are its  impossibly long lines and slow serving times. Faint music is drowned out by the loud chatter of people socializing and employees yelling out order numbers.</p><p>At first taste, McDonald’s pumpkin spice latte was rather bland, reminiscent of instant lattes made from powder where you forgot to add sugar. On the visual side, the latte seemed lacking as well; there were no decorative spices like those that Starbucks had offered, and it looked like just another watery coffee. We began to doubt that they had even gotten our order right. However, as we kept drinking, a sugary cinnamon taste gradually became stronger. By our last sip, the latte was overwhelmingly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste, similar to the one someone gets after eating too much sweet candy. With the cost in consideration, the drink wasn’t horrible. It’s an inexpensive, sugary drink with the flavor of pumpkin spice that only appeals to those with a major sweet tooth.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:47:33.570596	14	1	Pumpkin Spice Lattes are probably why fall still exists.
199	﻿Wu Tang: A Return to Former Glory?	wu-tang-a-return-to-former-glory	<p><b>Enter the Wu-Tang</b></p><p>There are few greater introductions in hip-hop than RZA’s “Bring da mother[expletive] ruckus!” in Wu-Tang’s acclaimed debut album “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).” Since their entry into the scene in 1993, Wu-Tang did precisely that, as the group established a reputation as hip-hop’s arguably most legendary and talented group of rappers. Hailing from the projects of Staten Island, Wu-Tang was one of the most prominent players in the ‘90s East Coast hip-hop renaissance known for its dark, gritty sound and lyrical dexterity.</p><p>In spite of the success of groups that preceded them, such as the bad-boy groups NWA and Run-DMC, Wu-Tang aimed for a more cerebral approach, focusing on lyricism and wordplay and compromising aggression, catchiness, and volume in favor of a more stripped, minimalist sound to complement their lyrics. Wu-Tang’s songs are heavily influenced by the members’ experiences with gang violence, drug abuse, and poverty in the housing projects of Staten Island, which are ripe with storytelling possibilities.</p><p>A hallmark of Wu-Tang is the frequent references to kung fu and martial arts films in their work, which add an additional poetic layer to their lyrics. By incorporating Chinese philosophies and schools of thought, Wu-Tang created an unusual blend of Western and Eastern cultures, which was considered groundbreaking for hip-hop at the time. Elements of violent gangster rap were juxtaposed with Eastern themes of spiritual enlightenment. Wu-Tang also drew inspiration from the swift, brutal, and calculated blows seen in martial arts, metaphorically adopting those techniques into their unique style of rapping and representing rap battles within their songs as “duels.” These qualities highlighted the group’s unusual articulation of storytelling and drew in many listeners.</p><p>Wu-Tang’s most notable contribution to hip-hop was their album “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).” While well known for its raw and violent lyrics, the album also had trademark elements that defined the group: skits, soul and R&B sampling, and knowledge of martial arts films and Eastern culture. Consequently, Wu-Tang’s debut album established an unfairly high standard for their subsequent work as a group.</p><p>The general consensus in the hip-hop community is that the solo endeavors of members of the Wu-Tang Clan far eclipse their collective efforts with the exception of “Enter the Wu-Tang.” Albums such as Ghostface Killah’s “Ironman” (1996) and Raekwon’s “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx” (1995), to list only a few, are revered as some of the genre’s greatest. In the case of Wu-Tang, the whole is less than the sum of its parts as the group gradually garnered acclaim and attention through its individual members; every member has gone on to release solo albums in his career. Wu-Tang has no shortage of rappers that are dominant forces in their own right with their defining skills, whether it’s Raekwon’s vivid and violent imagery, GZA’s unmatched lyricism and vocabulary, Ghostface Killah’s storytelling and narration, Method Man’s eclectic persona, or RZA’s talent as a producer.</p><p>The mythical status attributed to Wu-Tang is almost certainly a result of the amount of raw talent the group possesses. However, the ability to utilize each member's’ skills to its fullest potential has eluded the grasp of Wu-Tang since the release of their first album, the groundbreaking idiosyncrasies of which have long lost their novelty. Subsequent Wu-Tang albums, though unfairly held to the incredibly high bar set by their debut, were criticized for trying too hard to outdo the creativity seen in “Enter the Wu-Tang.” Producer RZA had a large role in this, as he was responsible for orchestrating the sound and thematic elements behind many of the group’s songs. RZA often attempted to re-brand the group’s image with each new album release, departing from the qualities that made “Enter the Wu-Tang” such a success. The colorful dynamics and chemistry between each member were also lost after each one of them released successful solo albums in the late ‘90s and developed their own preferences for how an album should be produced.</p><p><b>The Saga Continues</b></p><p>24 years after the release of “Enter the Wu-Tang,” the group re-emerges into the radically changed music industry of 2017 with their latest album release “Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues.” Despite a slew of album releases this past decade, Wu-Tang’s re-entry into hip-hop in 2017 holds more significance than any of their other post-“Enter the Wu-Tang” albums, many of which were considered disappointments because of the current state of hip-hop that the group refers to throughout the album. Their previous album, “A Better Tomorrow” (2014), was an unsuccessful foray into the realm of contemporary pop, which produced considerably tame results stripped of the elements that made Wu-Tang a force to reckoned with in the past.</p><p>Hip-hop has taken a completely different trajectory since the ‘90s, a period often called its golden age. This distinction is apparent with the de-emphasis on both lyricism and musicianship, hallmarks which defined the golden age. Wu-Tang’s raw sound, which incorporates R&B, soul, and simple driving beats, would alienate most listeners of contemporary hip-hop. “Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues” was produced with the fans of Wu-Tang’s former glory days in mind, hence the album title’s allusion to a saga —the legacy of hip-hop’s golden age.</p><p><b>An Homage to the Old School</b></p><p>The intro of “The Saga Continues” begins with trumpets to signal a triumphant return after a three year hiatus. It also contains a familiar Wu-Tang trait: dialogue excerpts from martial arts films. RZA then interrupts and goes on on to establish the premise of the album by alluding to Wu-Tang as the “Buck Rogers” of the 21st century, a group that awakened from their slumber and found themselves amidst an unrecognizable future.</p><p>“The Saga Continues” really takes off following the intro with “Lesson Learn’d,” one of two singles in the album. Paying homage to the hip-hop classic “Nuthin But a ‘G’ Thang” (1992) by Dr. Dre with the opening verse lyric “One, two, three and to the foh,” Inspectah Deck immediately follows with swagger characteristic of Wu-Tang in the self-praising line “I splash bravado, fast cash aficionado / Savage vandal, I’m a legend of tomorrow,” demonstrating the group’s awareness of their considerable footprint and influence on the hip-hop world.</p><p>The next song “Fast and Furious” also pays homage to an old school hip-hop legend by sampling Biggie’s “Who Shot Ya” (1994), an East Coast classic known for its ominous piano melody and simple beat. The outright violent raps in “Fast and Furious” are stylistically reminiscent of the legendary feuds and battles of hip-hop that Wu-Tang had witnessed in the past. This notably includes the well-known East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry which the group helped spark by reviving the East Coast scene with their release of “Enter the Wu-Tang.”</p><p>The musicianship of “The Saga Continues” is also one of its strongest elements reminiscent of Wu-Tang’s classic works. This includes R&B/soul sampling and traces of jazz through a driving bass line, simple beat, and a piano melody quietly buried in the background sound in lead single “People Say,” much like the melody used in the Wu-Tang classic “C.R.E.A.M” from “Enter the Wu-Tang.”</p><p>However, the dark, gritty sound prevalent in early Wu-Tang works has a diminished presence in “The Saga Continues.” Rather, Wu-Tang draws musical influence from its fellow East Coast contemporaries and borrows heavily from jazz-centric rappers such as Nas and JAY-Z. Songs such as “If Time is Money” (Fly Navigation) and “Frozen” complement powerful basslines with an unusual array of instruments such as woodwinds and the xylophone. The album’s utilization of percussion is also a testament to its insistence on old-school sound and rejection of the rapid-fire trap beats that are ubiquitous in contemporary hip-hop. Wu-Tang consistently uses steady, snare-heavy beats to complement, not overpower, their instrumentation.</p><p><b>Beatdown of the New School</b></p><p>“People Say,” the lead single in the album, showcases the group’s dissociation from today’s social media-driven hip-hop, defined by rappers that are more in touch with mainstream pop culture. Rappers from the golden age were the antithesis to mainstream pop culture, often denying themselves a marketable image in favor of producing insightful lyrics and narratives of marginalized ghettos and projects, a side of society that was largely hidden from consumers. The biting social truths of golden age hip-hop are mostly absent in hip-hop and the music industry as a whole today, as making the Billboard Hot 100 has become a disproportionately larger measure of success than producing thoughtful lyrics and musicianship.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, “People Say” is a standout in the album. Method Man’s opening verse in particular contains a few gems, one of which is “Nah see I don’t dab and I don’t nae nae / Got bottles coming out, warriors coming out and play-ay,” distancing Wu-Tang from some of the most recent hip-hop fads. Method Man takes it slow with his flow and reminds his listeners of his unquestionable authenticity in the lines “Until my heart turns cold, I’m a product of the block / We used to cook the product in the pot, add soda turn the product into rock.”</p><p>Method Man’s verse in the song “Frozen” further points out the group’s distaste for contemporary hip-hop and firmly establishes this distaste as a major theme of the album. His lines “Music is life, I ain’t into fashion or ice / I ain’t into chain snatchin’, ain’t into smackin’ a wife” and “It’s always been about the struggle, y’all just didn’t get it / My hood trouble, if y’all don’t live here then don’t visit” are self-explanatory. Method Man criticizes rappers today for losing touch with the purpose of hip-hop: to evoke thoughts and emotions on social injustices, rather than to align with the trends of mainstream pop music. This sentiment is most apparent in the line “I push the limit while rappers is pushing gimmicks.”</p><p>In the song “Why Why Why,” RZA’s introductory lines “If I put my fist through the face of a racist, smack ‘em tasteless / Would I face three cases in court, locked in places? / Or shackled to a seat of a bus, a hundred of us / Life in America shouldn’t be so tough” bring to light the very questions that were asked several decades prior by many rappers. The interlude lines “No discrimination, peace and love / From generation to generation” are timely, given that the nation is being torn apart by terror attacks, debates over anthem protests, a rise of white nationalist groups, and a bitter divide between political parties.</p><p><b>Closing Comments</b></p><p>“Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues” shines in its homages to golden age hip-hop and its criticisms of contemporary hip-hop. The album’s social commentary and use of vivid narratives are also refreshing returns to hip-hop’s lyrical and poetic prowess that was the norm years ago. The album functioned as a collection of lyrics that showcased the unique skills and styles of each member that were present in each verse they took over, much like in “Enter the Wu-Tang”.</p><p>“The Saga Continues” is ultimately a success because it draws influence from Wu-Tang’s early works and does not deviate from the formula that originally rocketed them to fame. Given the state of hip hop today, Wu-Tang did not need to produce a groundbreaking album like they did in 1993. Rather, “Wu-Tang: The Saga Returns” is exactly the album that many rappers now need to take note of; this is how you do hip-hop.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:48:00.987611	16	1	“Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues” was produced with the fans of Wu-Tang’s former glory days in mind, hence the album title’s allusion to a saga —the legacy of hip-hop’s golden age.
200	﻿Turtles All the Way Dab	turtles-all-the-way-dab	<p>I started reading “Turtles All the Way Down” by John Green a few days after receiving it in the mail on its release date, October 10, 2017. I had pre-ordered a copy (signed in green Sharpie) the day after I heard about it, because I am a White Girl (as in while writing this sentence, I literally pushed up my clear Warby Parker glasses and took a sip of my Tangerine La Croix Sparkling Water boss-level white). I am in fact so white, and so openly obsessed with the idea of John Green, that my father, who is in the habit of surprising me with books, also pre-ordered a copy he then had to cancel.</p><p>As the epitome of Green’s demographic (emotional white teenage chicks who read), my opinion of his new book is expected to be positive. But I don’t think you should read it because it’s “beautifully written and just breathtaking” or “EMOTIONAL,” (lines I stole from reviews of Green’s previous and most popular book, “The Fault In Our Stars.”) You should read it because it tells a story that is important for teenagers to hear in the midst of an epidemic of depression and anxiety: what it is to be someone or love someone who lives with debilitating mental illness.</p><p>“Turtles All the Way Down” focuses on Aza Holmes, a highly anxious high school junior in Indianapolis, Indiana. It satisfies everything you’re looking for in a Young Adult (YA) novel. There are teenagers in it. They go to class, and they fall in love, and there’s holding hands and some kissing. The characters are awkward and young in a real-feeling way, and they go on comedic adventures, where they piss off Holly, the Applebee’s waitress, by coming in every week to use up an excessive number of “Two Burgers for Eleven Dollars!” coupons. There’s clever banter about interspecies romance between Chewbacca and Rey and tender moments of emotional sharing. Bonus: Aza and another character, Davis, both have one dead parent for extra angst and emotional connection because absentee parents are a YA tradition. Spoiler alert; Davis is the romantic interest. Wow. What a shocker.</p><p>What makes “Turtles All the Way Down” unique within its genre however, is its very real portrayal of mental illness and obsessive thoughts.</p><p>I started reading “Turtles All the Way Down” in the middle of a mental breakdown. I was trying to get myself to stop crying. It was 11:00pm, and I hadn’t finished a single thing that day. There were no lights on in my room, and I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the carpet and treading frantically as my thoughts tried to drown me. I was convinced that the world was caving in, that everyone would be disappointed in me, and that I wasn’t living up to the expectations everyone else had for me. I picked up the book from my bedroom floor and turned on my reading lamp, hoping to find solace in its pages. I just wanted to stop crying.</p><p>Aza’s struggle with OCD does not feel romanticized; it feels crunchy and difficult and frustrating and awkward. Aza experiences mental health the way my friends and I do, and as I was reading it, I constantly heard our words in hers. I read Aza’s explanation, “I don’t know, I don’t like the feeling of having to take a pill to feel like ‘myself,’” in my best friend’s voice. When Aza talks to and about her therapist: “I wanted to tell her that I was getting better, because that was supposed to be the narrative of illness: it was a hurdle you jumped over, or a battle you won. Illness is a story you tell in the past tense,” I read in my own.</p><p>I’ve always been a fan of Green’s work; beyond novels, he and his brother Hank Green run an internet empire centered around their YouTube channel “vlogbrothers.” Part of what draws me to their online work is how Green has always been public about his mental health, and in the last year, has been increasingly candid about his OCD. “I experience these obsessive thought spirals in which intrusive thoughts, that is, thoughts that I don’t want to have that seem to come from outside of me, sort of hijack my consciousness,” he said in a vlog published this July, titled “What OCD Is Like (for Me).” “If I can’t choose my thoughts, and I am at least partially made up of those thoughts, am I actually the captain of this ship I call myself? And the more you think about that, at least for me, the more it becomes like… the premise for a horror movie.”</p><p>The veritas of his experience and the eloquence with which he translates it into fiction is what makes the book rich and valuable, rather than just entertaining. This novel is warm,  satirical, and romantic. It is a comfort food for the YA reader. But as a young person in an increasingly emotionally-tumultuous age, it is recognition for my experience.</p><p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been made aware that for people who haven’t experienced mental health, it can be incredibly difficult to empathize. “I never viewed PTSD and stuff as real,” a girl in my English class shared. “I never got why that wasn’t something you could just get over.” Another friend confided in me that when her sister was dealing with severe anxiety and depression, her family didn’t really understand what was happening — to them, it seemed like something she should be able to get over. And I’ve even had those thoughts myself: the painful thing to ask myself is why I won’t just do my homework. It’s difficult to understand that sometimes the problem is bigger than yourself. Reading “Turtles All the Way Down” is valuable because it creates empathy links, either helping neurotypical people understand neurodivergence, or reminding mentally ill people of the importance of self-forgiveness.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:48:34.694868	15	1	Reviewing John Green’s latest novel, “Turtles All the Way Down,” as someone very familiar with his work and life, and through the lens of someone who also deals with mental illness.
201	﻿Greyducks Continue Streak of Borough Championship Victories	greyducks-continue-streak-of-borough-championship-victories	<p>Junior Justin Zhang cramped up in the middle of the 4-kilometer varsity race in the Manhattan Invitational at Van Cortlandt Park on Saturday, October 14 and was forced to drop out. Just two weeks later, he finished third in the Manhattan Borough Championship varsity 5-kilometer race. This turnaround was symbolic of the performance of the entire Stuyvesant boys’ varsity cross country team, who bounced back from near last place in the Manhattan Invitational to winning the Borough Championship at Van Cortlandt Park on October 28.</p><p>The Greyducks entered the championships with an ample amount of pressure. In the last decade and a half, when the team was coached by Mark Mendes, they never lost a borough championship. However, the Stuyvesant team had been beaten badly by the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering (HSMSE) team at the Mayor’s Cup, and therefore, it was no longer thought that the team would win.</p><p>In the Manhattan Borough Championship varsity race, sophomore Baird Johnson finished second with a time of 18:14.79 and was followed by Zhang in third place, who ran an 18:28.25. A trio of Greyducks, senior and co-captain Minhein Htet, senior Clive Johnston, and senior and co-captain Jesse Sit placed in sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively, accomplishing coach Carl DiSarno’s game plan. “[My goal for the team is to] break up [HSMSE’s] pack,” coach DiSarno said. Junior Caleb Hoo placed 12th and sophomore Oliver Cai placed 14th to round out the varsity team.</p><p>Zhang, Htet, and Sit all ran personal bests at the meet, but had higher expectations for themselves. “I was hoping to run in the 18:20s, but I wasn’t able to,” Sit said.</p><p>Both Sit and Htet believed that the windy conditions lowered the times, but they were satisfied with the team’s overall performance. “The fact that people still ran better despite the wind shows that our team is getting stronger,” Htet said. He also thinks that their training has contributed heavily to their success. “The patience from building a proper base [and] then moving on to speed is finally paying off,” Htet said.</p><p>The junior varsity team dominated the event to the surprise of the upperclassmen. “I was shocked,” Htet said. The Greyducks had five of the top 10 finishers, with James Huang in first, Ramon Wang in second, Steven Zheng in fourth, Steven Tan in fifth, and Jacob Olin in ninth.</p><p>“Many of our JV runners set new personal bests,” DiSarno said. In both the varsity and junior varsity races, Stuyvesant placed first, followed by HSMSE in second and Hunter College High School in third.</p><p>The Greyducks now have their sights set on the city championships, which take place on Saturday, November 11. Despite having greatly improved from their first meet of the season, the Greyducks have to get even better in order to win the championships. “If you were to combine the results from the five boroughs, we currently sit fifth in the city. [The] top four [teams] make it to the Federation Meet, so we’ll need to perform our very best if we are to qualify,” Coach DiSarno said.</p><p>Captains Sit and Htet are both hopeful that the Greyducks will be successful in the city championships and qualify for states. “If we keep doing what we have been doing, getting the mileage and the speed work in, we can definitely beat out the other contenders for the third and fourth spots,” Htet said.</p><p>“If one of the top four teams slips up, I think we’ll be ready to pounce,” coach DiSarno said.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:48:51.998173	24	1	The Greyducks accomplished their goal of winning the Manhattan Borough Championships and look ahead to their next goal of qualifying for the state championships.
202	﻿The Determination of the Mimbas	the-determination-of-the-mimbas	<p>Facing off against Midwood High School in the first round of the playoffs, Stuyvesant’s girls’ soccer team, the Mimbas, played a tightly contested game. After giving up an early lead, senior and co-captain Saloni Majmudar tied the game up in the first half with a solid assist by sophomore Selene Kaehny. Then, nearing the end of the half, Kaehny hit a decisive free kick to give the Mimbas the lead that they wouldn’t relinquish for the rest of the game. This was the team’s first playoff win for the graduating senior class, and they savored every moment of it.</p><p>Once again, the Mimbas’ defense played a critical role in the win. For the sixth time in 16 games, the team limited its opponent to under two goals. This defensive-minded approach takes pressure off the offense by limiting the opposing team’s scoring. “I was really proud of how we played,” Majmudar said.</p><p>Sadly, in the following game, the Mimbas lost a difficult match of 6-0 against Francis Lewis High School, ending their season. Even though the match was one-sided in its outcome, the team fought until the end. “We definitely played our hearts out for the full 80 minutes. We knew we were going into a tough game, playing the two seed, but we didn’t let that get to our heads,” senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl said. However, after such an exhilarating game two days prior, the team did not have enough to muster another victory.</p><p>Though the team lost in the second round, the Mimbas have been steadily improving since the current seniors first arrived. “During my freshman year, we only had one win so it was so rewarding to see my four years of hard work on the team pay off,” Majmudar said. Each year, the team has improved. After going a combined 3-22 in 2014 and 2015, the team jumped to 6-5 in 2016 and had a playoff berth. Unfortunately, they lost in the first round to Cardozo High School, 3-0. This year, the team made it to the second round and finished with a tie for third in its Manhattan A2 division, the highest finish to date.</p><p>Overall, this team will hopefully continue to improve for next season. Only three players will be graduating—Majmudar, Ruhl, and senior Sophia Gunluk—so much of the team will remain the same. Many of the team’s offensive players will also be back, as sophomores Kaehny and Eve Wening, as well as freshman Aki Yamaguchi, who scored eight goals each, will provide an elite 1-2-3 combination for the offense next year. After a taste of the playoffs this year, this young and competitive team will remain strong in the upcoming years. “I can’t wait to see how this team continues to grow in the years to come,” Ruhl said.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:49:00.830205	24	1	The Mimbas are defeated in their second game of their playoffs, but have high expectations because of their prospects
203	﻿Greyducks Dominate Borough Championships Once Again	greyducks-dominate-borough-championships-once-again	<p>As junior Clara Mohri and freshman Julianne Yotov approached the end of the varsity 5-kilometer race, they were side-by-side battling for first. Well ahead of the others, they both had the finish line in their sights. They mustered the energy they had left, and as they crossed the finish line, they both believed they had won. The runners had the same time (21:26:55), but Mohri was crowned the champion by less than a hundredth of a second in an amazing finish.</p><p>Going into the Manhattan Borough Championships on October 28, the goal for the Stuyvesant Greyducks, the girls’ cross country team, was the same as it was for the first day of practice: make it back to the state championships. The Greyducks were in great form coming into the race, with fresh, good performances in the Grand Prix and Manhattan Invitational. After the invitational, coach Rachel Beck said, “Our Greyducks went out in full force last week at the last Grand Prix race, as well as the Manhattan Invitational. We had a lot of personal records and we are gearing up for the final push into the championship season. Stay tuned. These girls are on fire!”</p><p>As the last runner crossed the finish line, the results brought them one step closer to their goal of reaching State’s. In both the junior varsity and varsity 5-kilometer race, the Greyducks overwhelmed their opponents, handily winning both.</p><p>In the junior varsity race, out of 42 total participants, five of the six top finishers were Greyducks, led by junior Vivian Cribb with a time of 25:4:13. She has been a consistent force for the Greyducks, placing third at the NYC Mayor’s Cup on October 1. She was followed by sophomore Jing Su (25:32:28), senior and co-captain Connie Lei (25:48:80), sophomore Ling Chen (25:52:04), and junior Bernice Chen (26:0:65) who finished third, fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively. “During the recent race, we made many accomplishments. Many of our newer JV girls were running their very first 5-kilometer race at Van Cortlandt Park. Some girls broke personal records, [and] others showed steady race times and race ethics,” Chen said. “I’m proud to say that Stuyvesant High School is the Manhattan Borough Champion.”</p><p>In the varsity race, the Greyducks had five runners in the top 12, with Mohri and Yotov finishing at the top of the podium in first and second. Junior Tiffany Zhong, who placed 11th (23:21:17) in the varsity race, said, “We prepared for the race by practicing everyday and giving it our all during hard workouts. I’m extremely proud of the team for placing first in both varsity and junior varsity in the Manhattan Boroughs. Our top five JV girls all placed sixth and below, and our top five varsity girls placed 12th and below.”</p><p>Despite their win in the Borough’s, the team still needs to work hard to qualify for the State Championships, which will be based on the City Championships on November 11. “Our team is still working hard toward improving our times. Last year, we qualified for states for the first time in 13 years, and we hope to maintain our streak,” Zhong said. After enjoying tremendous success in the Borough Championships, the Greyducks hope to overcome the next hurdle on their quest for State’s: the City Championships.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:49:18.557653	24	1	Going into the Manhattan Borough championships on October 28, the goal for the Stuyvesant Greyducks, the girls cross country team, was the same as it was the first day of practice: make it back to the state championships.
204	﻿The Peglegs Push Through to Playoffs	the-peglegs-push-through-to-playoffs	<p>The Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity soccer team, finished off its strong season with an unfortunate loss in the playoffs. Second in the Manhattan A1 division, the Peglegs finished with an 8-2 record during the regular season and 24 team points out of 30, a high standing for any team. With their strong record, the Peglegs hoped to continue their momentum during the playoffs, but ultimately lost 0-1 to Newcomers High School in the first round on Sunday, October 29.</p><p>Though the Peglegs were second in their division, behind their primary rival Martin Luther King Jr. High School (MLK), this season’s record is their best divisional standing in three years. Their successes, however, have not come without sacrifices. During their last regular season game on October 24 against Frederick Douglass Academy, the team lost senior and first-string (starter) goalie David Power to an injury. Power took an ugly kick to the face and had to make an early departure, accompanied by the team’s coach, Vincent Miller.</p><p>Luckily, both of the boys’ and girls’ soccer teams were playing their last regular season games on adjacent fields. As Power and Miller left in an ambulance, the girls’ varsity soccer team coach, Hugh Francis, took over as the team’s legal coach. Junior Feras Roumie filled in on goal. “[Feras has played in] a couple of games, so I feel confident [about his playing], and I think that he’s ready to step up. He’s going to be our starting goalie next year,” said Miller, prior to their playoff game. Despite the harrowing injury to Power, the team did not give up.</p><p>“I think we did well on converting our chances. We scored three goals again against this team that had pretty good defense,” said senior and co-captain Michael Gillow, when asked about what the team did well during their final game. “I think that we were able to shut down their long ball[s], which should help us a lot in the playoffs,” he continued. However, the game was not an easy win. With five remaining minutes and a tie at 2-2, junior Robert Nava was able to score a goal off of a free kick just outside the box, breaking the tie and securing a win for the team.</p><p>With the team’s final regular season game exhibiting the individual talents as well as the teamwork of the players, the Peglegs entered the first round of playoffs as a force to be reckoned with. They played their game against Newcomers’s Lions, with a total of 21 team points.</p><p>During the playoff game on October 29, the team faced bad weather and a new goalie on the opposing side. Roumie stepped up throughout the game, making a total of six saves, more than the Lions’s goalie. The match was very close between the two teams, but ultimately the Lions were able to score a goal off of a free kick, with the shot sliding just below the crossbar. During the game, the ball was slippery and hard to control, leaving Stuyvesant with a difficult loss.</p><p>Despite this being the final season for the senior Peglegs, they have high hopes for the future of the team. While the playoff game left the Peglegs without any goals, they did take several shots throughout the game, four by Nava and one by sophomore Jeremy Moller, illustrating the power of the underclassmen and juniors, something that did not go unnoticed by the captains.</p><p>“I think we have a really bright future ahead with a strong core, including Robert, who was a highlight this season with his goal-scoring, sophomores like [Moller] and Lewis [Woloch], and also freshman, especially Amane [Anderson],” said senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzberg, showing his confidence for the years and seasons to come.</p><p>Commenting on the season, Miller gave also shoutouts to various players. “[Junior] Jeffrey Shen (left mid) has been playing exceptionally well for us these last couple games. [Senior] Sunny Levitis (right mid) also has been off to a little bit of a slow start early in the season and is now playing very well. One of our better players, Robert Nava [(forward)], who has been great all year long, [...] has done very well for us. He’s set up a lot of opportunities. All three of them play very well, especially together,” Miller said. With their season drawing to a close, the seniors are confident that they will leave the team in good hands, as the juniors and many underclassmen have shown themselves to be reliable and vital to the team this year.</p><p>Though the Peglegs were unable to make it as far into the playoffs as they had hoped and they will miss their graduating seniors, their future is loaded with young talent and a strong core.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:50:05.6935	24	1	Despite one of their strongest seasons in years, the Peglegs lost their first playoff game, effectively ending their season.
205	﻿Game, Set, and Match for the Lady Lobsters	game-set-and-match-for-the-lady-lobsters	<p>The Lady Lobsters, Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity tennis team, were served a disappointing playoff exit by the second seeded team, Beacon High School on Friday, October 20. The Lady Lobsters had beat Hunter College High School 3-2 in an earlier playoff match to get them into a second round match against Beacon. It was the second year in a row that the team had lost in the quarterfinals of the playoffs.</p><p>The Lady Lobsters entered the playoffs with a regular season record of 6-4, placing them third in their Manhattan A1 division. However, the Lobsters had lost their two matches against the first place team in their division, Beacon, in the regular season 0-5 both times. However, the scores of the individual matches between players grew closer between matches.</p><p>At the teams’ first meeting, an away game for the Lady Lobsters, all of the Stuyvesant singles players lost to their opponents 2-8. But the Lady Lobsters learned from their mistakes and worked to increase their number of game points. At their second and third meetings, junior and first singles Celina Liu lost to Beacon’s junior and first singles Kyra Bergmann 5-8, a significant improvement from the duo’s initial meeting. Similarly, Stuyvesant’s first doubles duo, senior and co-captain Karina Irwin and freshman Talia Kahan, went from losing 2-8 in their first match against Beacon’s first doubles, to losing 3-8 in the playoffs against the same team. The Lady Lobsters may have a 0-3 record against Beacon at the end of the season, but at the very least, they were able to make the Beacon girls work for their wins.</p><p>Despite the early end to their playoff prospects, the Lady Lobsters have reasons to feel good about their season, as they never lost two games in a row and improved from last year’s 5-7 record. “We weren’t that disappointed because despite us losing, we still played really well. I think that matters more than how far we actually advanced. Also, the team we lost to was incredibly good,” said senior, co-captain, and second singles Marie Ivantechenko, who went 4-2 in her singles matches in the regular season. In the playoffs, Beacon was the second seed, while Stuyvesant was the seventh seed. Beacon later finished as the runner-up of the entire tournament, losing to Brooklyn Technical High School.</p><p>Out of the team’s 19 members, six of them are seniors, so the loss of these seniors will be a significant blow to the team’s dynamic lineup. “There are so many seniors this year and it’s just sad to have a final game and know that these five or six people will never play with you again,” sophomore Alyssa Pustilnik said. Pustilnik was a large part of the team’s success and will attempt to fill this void, as she looks to build on this season in which she had a singles record of 7-2.</p><p>The team will also look to junior Lily Yan, who earned high praise for her strong performance this past season. “[One of] our second doubles [players], Lily, really stepped up. She’s been on the team since her freshman year, but was a sub until this year. She really improved over the summer, and is actually going to be one of the co-captains for the next season,” Ivantechenko said.</p><p>Though the season ended sooner than they would have liked, the Lady Lobsters still have a positive attitude about the season as a whole. “We’re losing a lot of players this year, but the captains are great, and we have a lot of strong players to build a new lineup next year,” Ionkina said. Some of the freshmen have already begun to help the team significantly, such as Kahan and second doubles Palak Srivastava, who had overall records of 6-3 and 6-4, respectively.</p><p>In order for the Lady Lobsters to continue their success and increase their chances of beating intense schools like Beacon, the young talent on the team will have to step up to fill the gaps in the lineup left by the seniors.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:50:45.161279	24	1	Despite a disappointing end to the season, the Lady Lobsters look forward to next season with optimism.
206	﻿Peglegs Finish with Pride	peglegs-finish-with-pride	<p>The Stuyvesant Peglegs ended their season with a warm farewell to their seniors. Friday’s Homecoming game at Pier 40 saw a large crowd full of supporters showing their gratitude for the hard work the team had put in all season. With awards being given out and banners commemorating the seniors, the stage was set for a final season hoorah.</p><p>However, the game did not go as planned. While the Peglegs ended up losing in a blowout, senior kick returner Rafsan Hamid gave the crowd something to cheer for. Having already taken a commanding lead late in the first half of Stuyvesant’s own homecoming football game, Frederick Douglass Academy was kicking off yet again. It was a short boot this time, without much air under it. The ball struck the ground well short of Hamid and seemed to meander towards him, seemingly bouncing without any rhyme or reason. Hamid approached it gingerly, anticipating the ball’s next maneuver. As he went to pick it up, it grazed off of his fingertip and came to a stop at his feet.</p><p>It seemed like déjà vu: Stuyvesant had already lost one possession to a muffed kickoff in the first quarter, so another fumble would have been the nail in the coffin with the game rapidly spiraling out of control. However, as quickly as he had dropped the bouncing ball, Hamid recovered it, promptly turning upfield and heading down the right sideline. In a slick sequence of jukes, Hamid snuck past the cover men, with the last tumbling to the floor like a horse on rollerblades. At that point, he was running free. With nothing but daylight in front of him, Hamid burst into the endzone. On one play, a swift sequence of no more than 10 seconds, Hamid had changed the course of Stuyvesant’s homecoming game and had given the Peglegs life—or so it seemed.</p><p>The return was called back due to a penalty. In an instant, all the hope and thrill that Hamid’s moment of greatness had brought was gone and erased. The Peglegs never recovered after that. As it turned out, that touchdown would have been Stuyvesant’s only score of the night, as the match ended 42-0 in favor of Frederick Douglass Academy, which was a disappointing culmination to a disappointing 0-9 season.</p><p>Despite what the scoreboard and standings table indicate, however, the Peglegs still have plenty of reason for optimism. While the Peglegs were outmatched by fierce competition throughout the season, they learned the lesson of getting up after being knocked down and never giving up through it. Ultimately, that is an indicator of success. “I believe each of these athletes will benefit from the experiences and memories from this season, no matter how much [a] 0-for season might hurt now,” head coach Mark Strasser said.</p><p>The night was a fine commemoration of the cherished time the team spent playing and bonding together. Playing their last game in the chilly air and under the lights of the pier, each of the seniors celebrated the amazing journeys and team experiences. As senior and co-captain Rafsan Hamid enumerated, “We all love and support each other, and we grew into one big family. Even though we had a tough time this season, we had a lot of fun.”</p><p>Co-captain and running back Perry Wang was just as grateful for his time as a Pegleg. “Reflecting back, I can say with confidence that some of my fondest memories of high school have to be playing football under the lights on Friday,” he said. “I've grown tight with a group of brothers I know I'll stay close with 30, 40, 50 years down the line. It's been an amazing journey, and I don't regret anything.”</p><p>The team may continue to struggle into next season, as the losses of graduating players with key positions will be tough to overcome next year. The team will rely on its current juniors to step up and fill these voids. Replacing senior quarterback Rigneyla is an area of controversy. While his play was somewhat inconsistent, with a completion percentage and passer rating of just 45 and 46 percent, respectively, one must account for the variables around him. Stuyvesant’s pass protection has been porous all season, with the quarterback seeing penetration from multiple rushers, especially up the middle, on any given play. Thus, the Peglegs’ passing offense was mostly limited to quick-hitting screen passes, and, in that dreadfully limited environment, Rigneyla was still able to hold his own. Junior Aidan Griffin is expected to take over as the starting quarterback, but it remains to be seen whether he will have the ability to lead the team every Friday, as his 30% completion percentage in limited action does not inspire much confidence.</p><p>Furthermore, the Peglegs must also replace much of their offensive line, including tackle Michael Kaydin and guard Matthew Au. Kaydin is an especially notable loss, as he became a lynchpin at left tackle toward the end of the season. His long arms allowed him to beat rushers to the edge, keeping the respective blind sides of Rigneyla and Griffin relatively clean. Au is no slouch either and was a mauler in the run game, clearing the edge for Rigneyla and running backs Tahsin Ali and Perry Wang to pick up first downs on the ground.</p><p>However, as the sentiment of the team’s leaders this year shows, success to the Peglegs means far more than just dominance on the field. As coach Strasser suggested, “Teams are unfairly judged on records alone and not on actual performance, team culture, and improvement of the team from start to finish.” While the seniors may not be leaving next year’s team with a winning record, they hope to leave a positive impression on them. Wang’s advice to next year’s team members is “to cherish the time you have left. It disappears really fast and you have no idea where time went.” Through all of the team’s setbacks, including the ill-fated homecoming game, there was still a distinct pride and energy that wafted over Stuyvesant’s sideline. The way that the team erupted during Hamid’s kickoff return was electric and represented a winning culture in spite of a losing record.</p><p>While this year may not go down as the strongest for the Peglegs, there was more to this team than record implies. The Homecoming game showed the support the Stuyvesant community has for its team, and even though it got out of hand, the team battled throughout. Led with strong senior presence and overall dedication, this team played with resiliency and heart until the last snap of the season.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 18:52:43.171846	24	1	
251	﻿Teaching Through the Terror	teaching-through-the-terror	<p><h4>Matthew Polazzo, social studies teacher</h4></p><p>I was in the inner office here, and I was getting work done [...] and then I heard [Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey] Pedrick through the speaker and she said that it was a shelter-in, and then the next thing I knew there were tons of kids crowding into the SU. So I went out into the middle to see what was going on and through the windows there it seemed like all hell was breaking loose. There were like tons of vehicles driving from all directions, there were cops sprinting everywhere, some with guns drawn.</p><p>From these middle windows over here, you couldn't really see what was exactly going on, but then after watching people running frantically through that window I went out to the outer SU. From the outer SU, paradoxically—you can see it’s further to the south—you still get a better view of the north, because the angle is better, and so that was when, by that time, the police had already put white sheets over the bodies of the two cyclists that had been struck.</p><p>By that time there were a lot of rumors flying around: people said that they had been shot, the news media still had not yet really figured out what was going on, and so the students in the SU and [I] were just trying to figure out what was going on, what happened. Between all the people in there we were able to get a pretty good sense of what had happened, that it was somebody in a truck. We figured out that they had driven south, that the victims hadn’t been shot, they’d probably been struck. We could see the mangled bicycles.</p><p>I couldn’t help but think back to the September 11 attacks, I was in the building for that. On a scale of one to ten this was like a one and that was like a nine in terms of the magnitude, obviously, but in a lot of ways it was similar—the interruption of the day, waiting to find out what was going on, the evacuation of the building, [...] the fact that during both attacks students encountered death. Anyone who looked out the windows of the building were able to see the bodies of the dead people over here, and also paralleled with all those individuals that saw people jumping to their deaths during the 9/11 attack. And then of course the aftermath, in both cases going back into the building and trying to sort of calm down a population that may or may not be sort of shell-shocked by what they saw.</p><p>I never really felt afraid or worried for whatever reason, maybe that was—I don’t know—cockiness or foolishness or maybe an unearned feeling of immortality, but I didn’t feel personally endangered even when I saw the flaying of guns. I can’t really say what that was but I just felt that way. The only time I got a little bit nervous was after it became clear what had happened and I was a little worried that maybe there was like a bomb or something in the truck. But, after that fear was assuaged I never really felt nervous after that.</p><p>I was really proud of the way everyone at Stuy conducted themselves and I’m really sorry that people had to see this event, but hopefully as a community we can come through it together, and become maybe stronger and more resilient.</p><p><h4>Katherine Fletcher, English teacher</h4></p><p>I was with my 10th period freshman composition class [...] And the announcement came over the loudspeaker—it was somewhere around three o’clock—that we were in a shelter-in, and I could tell from the tone of Pedrick’s voice that it was not a drill. I don’t know how I knew, but I just sort of did.</p><p>My students had a piece of writing due that day and we had a sharing day, and the students were reading their writing out loud, and then it became very difficult for them to focus. I could feel the anxiety building in the room, so I actually ducked next door to the teacher workroom and I asked [English teacher Eric] Ferencz what was going on, because the students hadn’t started getting messages from friends and family yet, or checking the news, or whatever, and Ferencz told me that there had been an accident involving a school bus [...]  I was very worried that children had been injured and that was why we weren’t going outside.</p><p>I started trying to think of games we could play. We played three rounds of telephone, where you whisper things into people’s ears. We played a couple rounds of hangman. Some students tried to do some homework [...] Some students started singing “Feliz Navidad,” some students were singing “Guns and Ships” from the musical “Hamilton.” I tried to keep them from becoming incredibly rowdy. They kept their spirits up. But then, slowly, they started to get really restless. A couple of students started pacing.</p><p>When the detectives started coming around and it became apparent that the school was working toward an evacuation, many of my students put on their coats and acted like, even though we weren’t actually going to end up leaving for another 45 minutes or so, they put on their coats and they started hovering by the door. They were very claustrophobic, but very well behaved. I made sure they had all contacted their parents, and a lot of them had their phones out, they were receiving news updates about what was going on. I had a couple of sophomores in my room who didn’t have a class that period and needed to be in a classroom.</p><p>When it was time to evacuate, on 9/11, we had never had to think about how to evacuate in a safe and orderly manner. On 9/11, after the first tower collapsed, the assistant principal came over the loudspeaker and said, “Everyone leave the building and walk north,” and that was it. It was just get out of here and start heading north, and that’s what we all did. We didn’t even have the concept of a shelter-in back then, that didn’t exist; there was no shelter-in, there was no lockdown, that stuff didn’t exist. So I was really impressed of how well-managed the evacuation was. Even though it took a little bit more time, it was really orderly; it just felt very controlled and I was really grateful for that.</p><p>I went home. I have two children. They wanted me to be there to help them celebrate Halloween. I went home and my apartment building was having a Halloween party in the halls, and that was sort of a strange contrast. I didn’t have a sense of whether the whole city was reacting to this attack in the way that we did on 9/11, everything shutting down. If 9/11 had happened on Halloween, there would not have been any Halloween parties that would have happened. Going home to Brooklyn was weird because I realized how in some ways how local and contained the attack was, that it wasn’t reverberating throughout the city in the same way. My kids were not even really very interested in what had happened. My daughter was a little bit.</p><p>One thing that I was really curious about, actually, was what it would be like at school the next day, whether it would be one of these things that was no big deal, business as usual, or if students were going to be coming in the next day feeling really traumatized and needing to process what had happened. It was definitely the second thing. I was surprised at what it felt like to come to school the next day. I wasn’t expecting so many blocks to be cordoned off, and all the bright lights that were shining, and all the emergency vehicles, and it really felt like a disaster zone.</p><p>We spent a lot of time in most of my classes talking about it, and I am particularly conscious of how difficult it is for our Muslim students for the man who committed this act to have said “Allahu Akbar,” which is a prayer that our observing Muslim students say dozens and dozens of times a day, and it only means good and loving things, and so this for this man to sort of claim those words in this violent way, in this hateful way, is really hurtful, and so makes life really difficult for our Muslim students in ways that I wish I could protect them from. It’s horrible.</p><p><h4>Annie Thoms, English teacher</h4></p><p>I was teaching my 10th period Freshman Composition class; we were reading the Joy Luck Club, and we were discussing the story “Double Face,” and it was a lesson I really enjoy teaching and everyone was really into it. And then Pedrick came on the loudspeaker and announced that we were gonna have a shelter-in and I thought, “Oh it must be a drill, I didn’t remember seeing that on, you know the schedule for the drills, but you know it must be a drill.” And then she came on again like five minutes later and it was like, that seems odd. And then I started to be aware of the sirens outside and this classroom faces more north, so we started hearing emergency vehicles and seeing emergency vehicles and then hearing a lot of emergency vehicles, but I kept the lesson going and wanted to try and get to the end of it and also wanted to keep everybody focused on that, rather than gathered by the windows in a panicked state.</p><p>By the time we realized what had happened, it was over and then it was just sort of the waiting game [...] Pedrick just kept coming on the loudspeaker and then just kept telling us to wait in place, and my students are a really lovely group of ninth graders and they were terrific, I mean they were singing karaoke and some of them did their homework and they braided each other’s hair and they started doodling on the boards and they drew diagrams of mitochondria and started writing their Mandarin homework on the board.</p><p>In terms of the actual incident, this was a much smaller and contained incident than the attacks of September 11th. [...] On the morning of September 11th, I came in on a late schedule, and I actually got off the subway after the second plane had already hit. I didn't have a class of my own that morning, but I came into the building and then we were sent to homeroom fairly shortly after that. So I was with my homeroom, my freshman homeroom, and it was in the cafeteria for whatever reason, and so that was where we were evacuated from. So it was much more of a sense of a, chaos is a strong word, but it was much more a sense of like improvisation, you know; we didn’t know, the administration didn’t know what was happening.</p><p>After September 11th, I was in my second year teaching here and I had just become the theater faculty advisor, and so I worked with a group of [ten] students [...] and we created this play called With Their Eyes. [It used] interview-based monologues, so it was in the style of actors and playwrights and editors and so these ten students, the ten student actors, interviewed 27 members of the Stuyvesant community about their stories. [...] One of the things that struck me in 2001 and was one of the reasons why I decided to do this with the winter drama in 2001 is also very striking to me right now, which is that the human instinct [is] to tell your own story right after something like this happens. [...] I think that that’s a very human need, and I think that listening to the details of other people’s experience is incredibly valuable. I think that it is an exercise in empathy, and that it helps you remember and understand that our reactions to something like this are wildly varied and diverse and that’s fine, that’s totally valid.</p><p>I will say that one of the things that has frustrated me over the last couple of days was sort of the craziness of the media coverage, which was also true after September 11th. You know, you have reporters just like mobbing people, and mobbing our students [...] I had reporters calling me for the last two days, you know, calling me and e-mailing me. Everybody just wants to tell the same story, and they all want to tell like this tiny slice of the story, but all the same thing, over and over.</p><p><h4>Gary Rubinstein, mathematics teacher</h4></p><p>I was with my 10th period class and when we heard that there was a lockdown we eventually looked out the window and saw the bus that looked like it was crashed pretty bad, it looked like a bomb because there was a big charred area. We thought that was everything and that was the whole incident so we were watching out this window, the south window, we didn’t realize, had we looked out the east window it would be bodies on bike paths. Most of the time we were looking out at the bus rescue. We did not see the chase. On Tuesday the truck was right outside this window so unfortunately we were in a position where we saw things we wished we hadn’t seen.</p><p>It’s pretty scary to think that you could [have been] walking home from school or [have] been an innocent bystander in this and also I feel bad that my students had to see a bus crash and people coming out in a stretcher and that they had to see victims themselves lying on the ground and that was hard for them. I think a lot of students feel like they’re not affected by it but it might affect them later on, I worry about that.</p><p><h4>David Hanna, social studies teacher</h4></p><p>I was on the subway heading to Penn Station to catch a train home to New Jersey. I was unaware of what was happening. I didn't learn of the attack until my wife saw something about it online, after we had returned from trick-or-treating with our younger son. My initial reaction was shock, and then concern about students and colleagues at Stuy. It wasn’t clear yet what had actually happened. Just that people had been run into by a truck.</p><p>I walked across the footbridge about ten minutes before it happened. This upset my wife. She probably was thinking, “What if [he] had left ten minutes later?” My sons, in as much as they were aware of the attack, at least to my knowledge didn't associate it with Stuyvesant. And I would like to keep it that way, if possible. I don’t want them to worry about me being in New York. They have enough to deal with at school, etc., without worrying about me.</p><p>Sadly, I'm not surprised by these types of events anymore. It's the world that we've lived in for some time now. But you can't stop living your life. That was my feeling in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and I've held to that ever since. I will say that the eagerness of some to seize on this event to try to push a divisive agenda must be confronted. If ever there was a time to reach out and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our classmates, colleagues, and fellow New Yorkers who are Muslim, it is right now. I heard a story on NPR about the five friends from Argentina that were killed in the attack, and it really spoke to me. They were about my age, and they were out there living their lives to the fullest. I respect that. And I mourn for them, and the other victims of the attack, and their families.</p><p>I think it's important that the suspect be tried in a criminal court for murder, and not to give him the political "enemy combatant" platform he seems to want.</p><p><h4>“Eric Grossman, Assistant Principal of the English Department”</h4></p><p>By the time I realized what was happening, it was over because it happened very fast. It took me a while to register “Oh no!”</p><p>I wanted to make sure the students and staff were safe. I quickly found others from the administration and tried to get a sense of what they knew. The driver was apprehended very quickly, and once we were aware of something, he was already in custody. Very quickly, there were a lot of police officers and FBI agents. So I was not fearful about what was going on here. Overwhelmingly I saw kids were playing telephone, drawing on the board, signing songs; it seemed safe and not as horrifying and no one from Stuyvesant was seriously injured.</p><p>The feeling was very similar [to 9/11], the sense of some kind of outside threat that quickly became international news. We [were] in the building and getting e-mails and texts from former colleagues, former students, and faculty who were watching live while we were inside. The scale thankfully, was very different. The sense of participating in something historically can be tragic.</p><p>I don't know anyone who thinks anything other than what happened was terrible and the work of someone deranged. I know that the attack will be used for political purposes. My response is to want to make sure that all of our students, especially our Muslim students, can feel safe, respected, and totally free to change or anything like that.</p><p><h4>Dan Esposito, English teacher</h4></p><p>I was in the English teachers’ room and I was grading papers. That’s when we got the first shelter-in announcement. That seemed pretty normal. I think that a lot of people’s first impulse was that it was a drill or something. Just kind of out of curiosity I walked over to the window, and that’s when I saw people running. My first thought was that they were running away from basically where the World Trade Center was, where the Freedom Tower is. So that was kind of worrying. Those of us who were around sort of tried to piece together what was actually going on. The first thing we saw was the bus that had been hit, and it looked really scary. We didn’t really know what to make of it, so the next 30 minutes were just very confusing and frightening in the sense that we couldn’t get a full picture of what was happening other than what we could see out of this one, very limited, view of the window.</p><p>It was very jumbled at first, like it is in these things all the time. We were hearing all different things from different people, and I think that’s definitely scary. What was reassuring was seeing how level-headed everyone was staying, especially the students and the teachers. Everybody kind of knew what to do and knew how to respond. That was super helpful, not panicky or non-responsive. That was really inspiring. Throughout the night, what the school did such a terrific job of was, even though things were unclear and still very frightening, the school did such a good job of making everyone inside feel safe. At least that was the experience I had. There was a ton of announcements.</p><p>I think pretty early on, we got the impression that all students were safe inside, and that was a huge relief. I was kind of shut off in one little room with a few students who had been in the hallway.  I know Grossman was running around checking in on people, and you got this impression that everyone wanted to make sure everyone else was okay, and that was very reassuring.</p><p>What I remember is that everybody was kind of working together to piece together as much of a full story as we could get. We had one student with a laptop out who had a news report, and people were on their phone, people were sent Snapchat videos that other students on the bridge had taken. It did feel like very much like what a newsroom must feel like, of piecing together this story. It was just kind of surreal because we were in it, as we were trying to figure out what was going on. The attitude that all the students had for each other was very supportive and calming. Even though we were in here for so long, it made the whole thing more okay.</p><p>The Halloween parade runs right past my apartment. So I got off the train, and I was in the middle of this party and it was so surreal because I had gone from this really intense, emotional experience to this very silly Halloween party. That was, I think, jarring in a way. I went straight home. I feel like I got into my apartment, sat down, and I exhaled for the first time in four hours. I definitely needed to decompress for a little bit. I felt really proud of everyone else, and students especially. [I am] honored to be part of a school that can face crisis the way that Stuyvesant came together [and] faced it the other day.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 05:32:59.996854	27	1	
253	﻿After the Allahu Akbar Moment: How Muslims at Stuyvesant Feel After the Attacks	after-the-allahu-akbar-moment-how-muslims-at-stuyvesant-feel-after-the-attacks	<p>The attacks carried out by Sayfullo Siapov on Tuesday, October 31, occurred on Chambers Street, making Stuyvesant the center of a crime scene. After the attacks, it was publicized that Siapov yelled “Allahu Akbar” and has affiliations with ISIS, which has caused an influx of Islamophobia and hate speech against Muslims. Celebrities like Laura Loomer have made tweets that target and degrade women who wear hijab and Muslims in general, forcing Muslim students at Stuyvesant, who are no different from any other student who witnessed these attacks, to defend their religious faith and humanity.</p><p><b>Syeda Rahman, 10th Grade </b></p><p>“I was really annoyed to hear that that this guy yelled out, “Allahu akbar” when he came out of the truck, but I hate to say that I wasn't surprised. Whenever you hear about radical Islamists doing terrorists attacks, people tend to put all Muslims under the same umbrella. They think Islam is equivalent to radical Islamist views.</p><p>I stopped wearing the hijab out of fear. My parents told me that I should try not to look suspicious. People I know try what they can to not look suspicious and to hide where they're from essentially. For instance, some people with bulky bags try to carry less. Little things like that assure us that we aren't confronted.</p><p>After the attack, I can't stop replaying the sounds in my head, especially the gunshots. The fact that it happened is hard to process, but at the time, it was so surreal. I try to distract myself and tell myself I'm safe.</p><p>Being affected by the attack and seeing it makes it different. Honestly, every time you hear about an attack, we tend to slide it off and think of it as another attack. But I understand that every attack is important in its own way. Experiencing it myself kind of made me realize that it's not just another attack because it affects people in different places and ways. Also, I wish that people wouldn’t base their views about Islam on these attacks because they aren't representative the whole Muslim population. I'm afraid of the people afraid of me.”</p><p><b>Ayham Alnasser, 10th grade</b></p><p>“I was at Battery Park when the attacks happened. I heard the car crash, and I thought it was a UPS truck right in front of the park, so I didn’t think much about it. I walked up towards Stuyvesant to see if the UPS truck crashed. But that was when I saw the perpetrator walk out. I was going to take my phone out to record what was happening, but it was dead. I watched him run out and scream, “Allahu akbar.” After that, I saw the police officer shoot him six times. Being at the crime scene, a police officer escorted me to the school because it wasn’t safe for me to be there. When I was in school, I was a part of the lockdown for the next three hours. When I came back home, my phone charged, and I checked and saw that I got 20 texts. It didn’t really set in [that] I just witnessed this attack.</p><p>Reflecting on the situation now,  I consider myself to be a Muslim, so when I first heard him come out and say “Allahu Akbar,” I was irritated by the fact that he would say it. It’s clear that he isn’t really a Muslim because he killed people. He just pissed me off as a Muslim and as a student at Stuyvesant. I am not unnerved by the incident, even though I have seen a lot because the [cop shooting him] was warranted. I’m not traumatized by the incident. It only helps me further respect the NYPD. I don’t like how much this incident has been so publicized because it's become politicized, and it stops the incident from actually being an actual murder and just becomes a statistic.”</p><p><b>Stephanie Raza, 10th Grade</b></p><p>“I’ve heard various reports about whether the perpetrator even said, “Allahu akbar” when he came out of the truck. It could be that he was just saying something in a foreign language and people are so scared or racist they just assume he said “Allahu akbar.” I was kind of disappointed seeing people categorize this attack as being done by another Muslim and it being so publicized because of that. When the Las Vegas shooting happened, people jumped to the assumption that he had a mental disorder before they said the massacre was a terror attack. But in this case, they jumped on the opportunity to call it a bloodbath or a terror attack without having details fully confirmed.”</p><p><b>Yasmeen Hassan, 9th Grade</b></p><p>“A lot of my friends saw the attack happen, and they didn’t hear the man say “Allahu akbar.” I know that people have different stories, but I think just that part of the story stuck because people want to know this was part of a community or a bigger organization, so they can [turn their fear into] hatred. The next day on the subway, I was coming to school, and there was a newspaper on the seat right next to me, and the front page had “Terrorist Attack: Deadliest Since 9/11.” This title isn’t true because there have been a lot of attacks and mass shootings which have killed hundreds of people. Also, when I was going to the subway, I was terrified about what the people next to me are going to do or say to me when they see me because I’m Muslim. There was literally a woman reading about the attack on her phone, and I was just sitting there worrying if she was going to say something to me.</p><p>I was a bit shaken up by the attacks. I wondered why would Muslims do this to other people. If he was really a Muslim, why would he do it? He would be putting his family and everyone that is close to him in danger. I see this as a test from God to see how Muslims are going to handle this situation. Someone told me, ‘Our religion is going to be put under a lot of pressure, and it’s a test to see who’s going to power through and have faith in God to protect them.’</p><p>I know this community is pretty safe, but there is always one person that’s going to do something that is not right. I think the best thing we can do is stay strong.”</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 05:47:15.682872	27	1	
254	﻿After The Attack	after-the-attack	<p>I’ve written this article before—or at least something very similar.</p><p>I wrote it in 2015, after the Paris terror attacks; suicide bombers targeted a stadium and various restaurants and cafes, killing 130 people and injuring 413. Prior to that attack, various Middle Eastern countries had already been targets of deadly shootings, bombings, and explosions, but I think of the Paris attack as the first in a pattern of homegrown domestic terrorism in Europe, incited by ISIS’s propaganda. It was jarring to Europeans, Americans overseas, and the world at large. In the Opinions article I wrote following the attacks, I mourned the victims. I cautioned people not to paint Muslims with the brush of terrorism. I condemned the cowards who claimed to be Muslims and then took innocent lives.</p><p>It was a message that I knew I might have to deliver again—when the Brussels and Istanbul attacks occurred, when trucks drove over civilians in Nice and Berlin, when a van struck pedestrians on the London Bridge. But I never anticipated an attack near Stuyvesant. I never anticipated the masses of police officers that would be standing outside our school the next day or the deafening silence as throngs of people wearing black navigated a maze of barricades and orange vests, unsure of what to say and where to walk. We referred to it as “what happened yesterday” instead of calling it a terrorist attack—the latter would have felt too real. Frankly, I don’t think I ever anticipated Stuyvesant would be on the news for anything besides our cheating scandal, racial imbalance, and alumni disputes, but here we are.</p><p>I consider myself fortunate that I don’t have to deliver that message again, that I don’t have to remind you not to conflate Muslims with terrorists, that I don’t have to tell you that the Diversity Visa Lottery is one of America’s finest points, because I’m not entirely convinced that you need to hear it. I keep thinking of the way Stuyvesant responded to Donald Trump’s inflammatory remarks during his campaign; the way Stuyvesant came together after the 2016 election; the way we responded to the travel ban. Pundits online blame the attack on America’s supposedly lax immigration system, calling for stricter vetting and limited immigration, but I’m not sure they know that this is the last thing on Stuyvesant’s collective mind and that we are more focused on looking out for each other than looking for someone to blame.</p><p>I certainly never anticipated the words “Allahu Akbar” to come out of a terrorist’s mouth after he attacked my community. Allahu Akbar doesn’t belong in the mouths of evil; it belongs during prayers, during congratulations and celebrations and dinner and laughter, during miracles. You might have heard that Allahu Akbar means “God is great.” This is false. Allahu Akbar means “God is greater.” Greater than you or me, greater than some psychopath who is so afraid of life that he would try to snuff it out. Not everyone at Stuyvesant is religious, of course, but I think the concept of believing in something greater than yourself is one that strikes a chord within all of us.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 05:51:14.279719	27	1	Who even knows, honestly?
211	Finding Peace with Violence	finding-peace-with-violence	<p>The hallways were bustling with a plethora of entertaining and unique costumes, teachers were handing out candy, and people were animatedly talking about the usual struggles of Stuyvesant—tests, quizzes, and the lack of sleep. Later that day, I was planning on going trick-or-treating or at least overdosing on Skittles or M&M’s. Tests—and the ensuing anxiety—were coming up, but today was going to be a wonderful day.</p><p>I exited onto the bridge and down to the wall across the Tribeca Bridge. The sky was brilliant, the sun left a warm embrace on the pavement, and the air was crisp, yet comfortable. One could sit there on the wall, forget about the struggles of schoolwork and homework, and just appreciate how beautiful the weather was.</p><p>My friends and I were talking about something, and everything seemed to be so normal, when a loud bang interrupted our laughter and banter.</p><p>A horrifically dented school bus was the first thing I managed to discern through the putrid smoke in the air, and then, a deafening silence filled the air. Even the incessant movement of traffic seemed to freeze for a moment as everyone took in what seemed like a terrible accident.</p><p>“What just happened?” How could this have happened in the first place? The truck was in an extremely awkward position, and never in my life had I heard such a loud accident.</p><p>“He has a gun!”</p><p>For a moment, I froze in shock. A man got out of the truck, but from my angle and across the street, I could not discern a gun. For a moment, I stood there in awe.</p><p>Then I saw the running, the screaming from across the street, and the panicked expressions on the people around me. It suddenly dawned on me that this was something much more serious.</p><p>I sprinted down Chambers Street, and behind me I heard four gunshots. I didn’t even stop for a moment at the busy intersection. What the hell was happening? Police sirens pierced the air, and they joined together in a progressively louder wail that only intensified my heartbeat.</p><p>When I got home, I turned on the news, and I felt a sense of numbness. I was in shock. The helicopter footage showed my school and a scene of carnage that could only be described as traumatizing. I saw the bike path me and my teammates occasionally ran on strewn with the wreckage of bikes; on Snapchat, I saw the body bags.</p><p>Terrorism had struck with its evil scythe right in front of my own eyes, and suddenly, a concept we learned about in history class became so real.</p><p>At first, I only felt a sense of emptiness, of shock, of denial. This couldn’t have happened. Not in my world.</p><p>That night, the nightmares came in full force. Gunshots, me dying, my friends dying; I saw it all. I woke up early that morning, in a panicked sweat.</p><p>It had scarcely been a day since the attacks, and on the way to school, I still only felt shock. The long, slow procession of students marched around the crash site, under the watchful eye of thousands of policemen. The usual sounds of honking and chatter were replaced with the eerie drone of helicopters and the scary silence of West Street. This is all a bad dream. I walked the detour to school with the same friend that had run with me across Chambers Street when the attack started, and we couldn’t help feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>At school, the teachers all tried to return to business as usual, but a subdued sense of fear and sadness loomed over us all. People hugged me that day, and for the first three periods at least, I was holding up well.</p><p>The tsunami of emotions finally came crashing down when I went to guidance to talk about the incident. I didn’t even see it coming, but as soon as I sat down in front of my guidance counselor, the tears came rushing out. I had written about the events the night before, but now the gravity of the situation rained down on me with full force. All the thoughts that were suppressed by my stress response the night before came rushing out. Eight people died that day, and I was just in grief and extremely afraid. At that point, words couldn’t express the emotional roller coaster that I was on.</p><p>When I got home that day, I cried some more; I had homework that night, but I did so little of it. The usual background noises of sirens triggered me, and once again, my sleep was plagued with nightmares.</p><p>On Thursday, the Tribeca Bridge reopened, and life seemed more and more normal. With the exception of the police barricades and the flowers left for the victims of the attack, it almost seemed like the attack never happened in the first place. I no longer felt emotional pain or thought about the attack 24/7.</p><p>Now, the attack’s emotional trauma is gradually fading away from my mind, and in its place, new feelings have taken place. I hug my parents more often, I take the extra minute or two to appreciate them. I feel a newfound sense of appreciation for the world around me and the city I live in. My friends and I have grown closer, and our bonds have become stronger after this tragedy.</p><p>The terrorist attack on Halloween struck fear in my heart, but even though that fear has still not subsided, I strangely feel at peace with the demons in my heart. I still feel terrible for the eight families who won’t be able to appreciate their loved ones, but as their legacy, I love the people close to me even more.</p><p>I am forever changed by the Tribeca Attack, but I hope it’s for the better. This evil coward who tried to terrorize me has only made me feel more thankful to the greatness of humanity and the wonderful people my friends and family are. This act of terrorism hasn’t divided me—it’s stitched me back together, stronger than ever.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 20:42:24.022143	11	1

256	﻿Student Responses	student-responses	<p><h4>Julian Giordano, freshman</h4></p><p>I was in the Student Union room on the second floor [...] the doors closed and some guy started talking, and he said something along the lines of “there’s a guy [and] he has guns.”</p><p>Everyone else in the room was like, no, there were no shots, no, he doesn't have a gun. We didn't hear anything, so it made no sense. Two minutes later, all of a sudden, we heard the distant sirens. [So] we went to the window [and] we saw traffic at a complete standstill. You walk over the West Side Highway every day [yet] you never see the cars stop. But here you just have, it’s like someone clicked pause and all of a sudden all the cars are just stopped where they are.</p><p>What was most alarming to me and sort of frightening was [that we] saw no one on the path. There was this one Citi Bike right in front of the window just dropped, sitting on its side. It was next to a group of Citi Bikes, but there was this one fallen. And if you looked up the path to your left there was this one Citi Bike and it was folded [on the] path. I didn't see anything at first so I tried to look it up on the news. There were rumors we were on a soft lockdown, no one really knew what was happening. It started popping up on the news and when I walked back to the window I saw these white sheets on the ground.</p><p>We heard the PA system and then the Student Union coordinator [Matthew] Polazzo was in the hallway. He came in and he started looking out the window as well and he told us to stay calm, and then an announcement came over the PA system about a lockdown, and then we started getting news from multiple sources. And then people started calling their parents, and all you heard was people calling their parents and everyone was huddled by the window.</p><p>By around 4:30 [p.m.], approaching [5:00 p.m.], FBI agents and the police came into the school, I think. Some walked into our room with administrators and told us to get away from the windows. No one had been thinking that, no one knew what was happening but it could have actually been a threat to look out the window. If there had been an active gunman that could have been a problem.</p><p>Not knowing what happened was almost worse than knowing. I knew people who had ninth and 10th periods free sitting by the [mural outside], and that was literally where the man crashed the car by the intersection. No one knew if their friends were okay, and it was really worrying and really, really scary to not know.</p><p><h4>Andrew Hirtle, sophomore</h4></p><p>I was walking to Pier 40; the car must have driven by me on the bike path. We were on the river so we didn’t see it. We got to Pier 40 and then we saw like 10 ambulances and tons of police cars and fire trucks, and we just assumed it was a bad car accident so we went into the pier, [but] like five minutes later we came back out to check it out. We walked up to the bike path and we saw pools of blood, bloodied-up jackets, broken bikes with blood on them, and people crying. It was something out of a movie almost.</p><p>It didn’t hit me until the day after; I was like, wow, that sucks, it’s really messed up, but I wasn't in shock in the moment, I was like, wow, this is terrible. I had known the shots had happened at Stuy by then, [but] I didn't know what was going on, I didn't know if they were connected or not.</p><p>We tried to ask a police officer what happened, [but] they brushed us off, so we went back inside to Pier 40 on the field and waited while helicopters flew over us, and we just waited for our coach to come who was like, “You should go home.” It happened between [3:00 and 4:00 p.m.].</p><p>Yesterday, what I saw and what happened, I wouldn’t say I was traumatized but I was in shock yesterday; it was all kind of surreal, all that had happened in front of me. It wasn’t that bad coming to school, it was more like when everyone talked about it, just thinking about it made me uneasy almost, but like I’m fine now.</p><p><h4>Michelle Yang, junior</h4></p><p>I was at the window that was facing the lawn, so if you tilted your head you could see the school bus but you couldn’t see the actual truck that came from the West Side Highway. It started with the lockdown. I didn’t think that it was a serious thing. I thought that it was another drill since Stuyvesant usually does all these drills. I started realizing it was getting serious when [Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey] Pedrick was on the announcements saying the drill was going to continue.</p><p>My mom called me. She works at Union Square and she found out what happened before I did. She called me right when it was 3:35 and I was still in class and she said she was coming down from Union Square all the way to Chambers Street. I asked her, “Why are you coming to Chambers Street? Don’t you know there’s probably a suspect out there?”</p><p>I didn’t expect school to be open [Wednesday, November 1]. I kind of did expect it. I just thought that things were going to be a little different, but surprisingly classes were still pretty normal. I just didn’t know New York was going to be the next target. I heard about such attacks in Barcelona or in Las Vegas but I didn’t expect New York, again in the same territory as 9/11. As a person who grew up in New York, I felt kind of attacked in my identity.</p><p>Oh, and the reporters. When I was walking out of school there were all these reporters lining up, there was literally an entire string of TV channels with TV cameras set up. They were so malicious in a way; they just approached students and were asking questions like “Did anything happen?” [and] “Did you see anything? What did you feel?”</p><p>There was this one reporter who kept asking me for [my] name. They just kept asking my name. I explicitly told them I wasn’t comfortable telling them my name. Then they asked me, “What’s your English name?” [and] I was kind of offended. Next, they asked me, “Can I get a photo of you?” and I was like, “No, I’m not comfortable with that either.” The way they wanted information just to be added to the next article, it was just not what I expected from the media.</p><p><h4>Laith Bahlouli, freshman</h4></p><p>We saw him walk around the vicinity, walk around the road, and he was carrying two guns, [at least] they looked like guns. Then someone screamed he has a gun, and then immediately a lot of people started running away, and then this dude in a green shirt started to chase after the attacker, tried to chase him, and they were running around the entire intersection, and then the attacker [came] very close to the sidewalk. The sidewalk is separated by the road by a gate, he was right at the gate.</p><p>They continued walking around that area and chasing after each other. I turned my head because my friend said that we should leave, and then I heard the gunshot, four or five, I look back and I see Saipov on the ground and somebody screams and then everyone starts running, it was almost like a stampede. And then I run like three feet, and then me and this kid turn around and we run back to continue to see what happened.</p><p>[My friend and I] went on top of the bridge and we saw exactly what happened. They hadn’t covered the bodies yet and we were able to actually look at the bodies. They were on the side of the highway where the Citi Bikes are. There were two bikes crushed, just thrown about, and there [were] two bodies: one right next to the Citi Bikes and one back next to the trees.</p><p>It was pretty scary because Saipov came really, really close and he even looked back on me. And we actually saw, well I only caught a glimpse of the Home Depot truck crashing, [but] it was pretty intense.</p><p>It felt weird [coming back]. It was unbelievable, the way the police had blocked everything off, it was a big crime scene that people just the day before had died on the very land. I heard that eight people had died; it was kind of scary to see all the police with their heavy weaponry, everything was so odd going through a different entrance, and even the victims and the injured weren’t even released at that time. It was very uncomfortable.</p><p><h4>Debi Saha, sophomore</h4></p><p>I was in Spanish [class] when everything happened. I was closest to the window following Pedrick’s announcement. Everyone thought it was a drill. We joked about sitting out of the view of the windows and crouching under our desks. However, after the subsequent announcements and the audible sound of sirens, it was clear that this wasn’t a drill. The thing I remember most is the astounded silence with this backdrop of silence. The gravity of the situation was unclear but as people started to pull out their phones, a feeling of dread started to make its place in my stomach. The gravity of the situation truly sunk in when an FBI agent checked our IDs, when I saw the flashing red lights, [and] when I saw the suspect’s truck the next morning. Everything I had heard and seen was a whirlwind in my mind. I had peers who had seen the suspect pull out the fake guns, fearful that they were real. I had peers who were there and started running. I had peers who had seen the trail of dead bodies. That was something I kept thinking about. Imagine seeing these victims. Imagine not knowing where the bikes started and the bodies ended. If I [had been] there, I [don’t] know if I would have ran away or tried my best to help. My friend later [showed] me a picture of a dead body. I could not stop returning to the eight people who lost their lives. These were people who had families, loved ones, homes, and it was taken away from them. Following this was a barrage of posts on Facebook. Each one I saw seemed to break my heart and repair it back simultaneously. The posts about terrorism made me stop.</p><p><h4>Maxwell Lin, senior</h4></p><p>I was coming back from the subway station and I saw some freshmen running away from the direction of the bridge, but I thought they were running from a fire because they had set fire to a bag as a joke. So I didn’t think anything of it. So I kept walking to the bridge. And when I got to the intersection, I saw the the terrorist guy. He was holding up two guns. He was also chasing two other people from what I saw around the cars. When he rounded a corner, I just heard three shots and then I just turned around.</p><p>I didn't take it too seriously because I just wanted to get back into the school and didn’t know that he had already did so much damage with his vehicle. So I just thought that he was one gunman.</p><p>I did try to get back onto the bridge, but when I was on the bridge they had already administered the lockdown, so the doors were locked. I was with four other Stuy kids but they couldn't get in, either.</p><p>I was with the four other kids and the five of us were just really angry because what if the gunman had come up onto the bridge with a real gun. The five of us would've been dead. I think it's reasonable that they had the lockdown, but I think they should have put two guards at the door to let the students in because we couldn't get in and we were just stuck on one end of the bridge.</p><p><h4>Sehrish Ali, junior</h4></p><p>When we first heard the tires, obviously we thought, we are in the middle of New York City, so it wasn’t a huge thing, but someone who was sitting next to the window kind of gasped so everyone ran to see what happened and we ended up seeing people getting hit and stuff. Before they called the shelter-in we knew something was happening. We didn’t know it was as serious as it ended up being, but we knew people got hit.</p><p>I wasn’t in my class at the moment, I was up on the ninth floor. The teacher who was on the ninth floor with that class did not continue teaching, but eventually I had to go back down to my math class and the teacher downstairs thought it was a drill when they announced a shelter-in so he kept on teaching until students told him that people had actually died outside.</p><p>During the shelter-in, announcements were being made, [and] I thought that [they were] shocking. I get that they were trying to keep kids calm, but I felt like the way that they went about it, first of all not telling us what was going on outside, which made a lot of teachers think it was a drill and not an actual shelter-in, and then the way they were kind of cheery about it. I guess they were serious, but the way they were talking about it made it seem like Pedrick was cheering almost. I thought that was shocking given the circumstances because I felt that she should have been more solemn and more appropriate for what was going on outside.</p><p>When I was walking back to my class, I am not going to lie, I was pretty scared because there was no one in the hallways. I felt that there should have been more teachers standing in the hallways just to make sure that if kids were out using the bathroom or something that they would safely get back in the classrooms.  I guess there was no threat in there but at the same time we as students didn’t know what was going on outside because no one told us.</p><p><h4>Ziyun Zhang, sophomore</h4></p><p>I was walking down the staircase toward Terry’s and then I came back up to the bridge. I saw the crash into the post and saw the man take out two pistols and then I heard gunshots. I think my brain has kind of washed out the rest but that’s pretty much all I saw. [The people] were all crazed and as soon as he came out I heard screams and people were scrambling for cover. I saw the elementary schoolers across the street rushing back inside.</p><p>The vehicles just kind of stopped there, I think. The bikes were all knocked over. There was soil all over the ground. And the truck was pretty smashed up [...] and it smelled like gunpowder. I could smell it from the bridge. I was dazed and I honestly had no idea how to react. If it wasn’t for my friend dragging me back up the stairs towards Stuy I don’t think I would have done anything at all. I was frozen to the spot.</p><p>I remember some stayed by the staircase to keep watching and someone took out their phone? I don’t remember who. But others ran back. They were shocked and they didn’t know what was happening but someone screamed that there was a man with a gun outside.</p><p>I didn’t really feel anything but I think I’m finally getting the aftershock that this really happened and all these what ifs are running through my head and I can't imagine what the families of those who died must be feeling right now. Honestly, I think social media kind of blew the story out of proportion. I heard that some claimed it was a terrorist attack and I think it just kind of promoted Islamophobia again.</p><p>Some were making jokes about the whole situation and others were like, “I heard the man said, ‘Allahu Akbar’ as he took out the guns,” and I think that it’s wrong to just spread a story like that because it’s really easy for facts to get twisted along the way.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 05:57:38.336002	27	1	
257	﻿“I’m extremely scared:” From Dr. Zhang’s Perspective	i-m-extremely-scared-from-dr-zhang-s-perspective	<p>I found Dr. Yanjun Zhang in one of the biology labs on Thursday, November 2. Despite being the only person from Stuyvesant directly harmed in Tuesday’s attacks, he had only missed one full school day. Dr. Zhang, a lab specialist for the biology department, seemed to be doing well. He was shuffling around the labs with another teacher, cleaning things up, and arranging for the next lab. His right pinky and ring finger were both bandaged, and his right hand was noticeably swollen—a battered rainbow of yellows, greens, purples and blues—but it didn’t seem to bother him at all. He even asked me to come back during his free period because he didn’t want to leave the other teacher alone with the work.</p><p>During the attacks on Tuesday, Dr. Zhang was one of the Citi Bike riders hit by the truck. He was only injured in a minor way, but the person in front of and behind him were both killed. When I finally did get to talk to him, he told me his story.</p><p><b>Tell me what happened from your perspective.</b></p><p>My working hours are from eight to three, so on that day, I left a few minutes past three. And then I went downstairs as usual and picked up one Citi Bike. You know there’s a yard in front of the building and the bike path. I had just entered the bike path. I saw a truck driving in my direction, southbound, very fast, so I got very scared. I immediately stopped my bike. My position was about half in the path. The truck was very fast. Actually, the truck was on the other side of the path, so if the truck kept going in that direction, it wouldn’t hit me. I think the truck intentionally turned in my direction to hit me, and it hit my front wheel. Because the truck was so fast, the bike was hit, and then it tumbled, so I was also flipped backward.</p><p>It happened so fast—I don’t even remember what happened. I remember I tumbled backwards and stood up. I remembered that there were some instructions from my old instructors for emergencies, that I was supposed to talk to people right away, so I immediately asked people, “Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding?” and then they responded saying, “You’re okay, you’re okay.” But I was actually bleeding. And at that time, I heard somebody say, “He’s got a gun!” So I hid behind something solid. I ran behind a building, and I heard something similar to gunshots—I had no idea if they were gunshots because I was on the other side of the building.</p><p>Later on, I came out. I saw a lot of policemen, and I went to look at the bike I was riding. The front wheel was distorted. At that time, I was bleeding, so I told the policeman that that was my bike, and he told me to sit down and that he was going to get an ambulance for me. A few detectives also came to me to get information and take pictures of my driver’s license. I was put in an ambulance, and after some time, it brought me to the hospital, very close to the Brooklyn Bridge. I think it’s the Brooklyn Bridge, but I don’t really know.</p><p>At the hospital, they made me go through a lot of tests to make sure that my body was not damaged. One of the EMT guys said that I probably had my hand broken, because it was deformed so badly, but after all the x-rays, they found out that it wasn’t broken—it was just tissue damage.</p><p>There’s a lot of bruising and swelling. The whole body—there are lots of minor damages.</p><p><b>How long were you at the hospital?</b></p><p>I think they brought me to the hospital at about six. I was released at about 11. I remember I arrived at home sometime around 11 or 12, so I would say about five hours. Two of my colleagues actually came. They somehow got information from detectives. Detectives usually don’t give out information like that, but they came to visit me. It was very moving. The FBI has some kind of victim counseling agents, and there was a lady there to provide some kind of comforting effort, and my two colleagues came, so we were talking about it. At that time, I was very disoriented and very confused, and with them talking to me, it began to clear my mind a little bit. It has been very helpful.</p><p><b>How come you only stayed at home for one day?</b></p><p>Yesterday, I felt that there were too many wounds, and I shouldn’t come. But today, I felt that I should come, mostly to be with my colleagues and talk to them in a stable environment. It’s psychologically better to be communicating in an environment where people can talk to each other.</p><p><b>Do you feel okay?</b></p><p>Um, not okay, but not really that painful. I just can’t get the swelling off. But I asked some people, and they gave me all sorts of suggestions.</p><p><b>So how do you feel about it?</b></p><p>I don’t really have a lot of general opinions about it yet, but I’m deeply moved by the support that I’ve gotten from my colleagues. There are times where in normal situations we might have conflicts, but when bad things happen, the true natures of my colleagues show up. They are very, very decent people. They care about me very much. I believe that I care about them just as much.</p><p><b>How has the attack affected you?</b></p><p>Yes, I feel I have been very fortunate.</p><p><b>Were you here for 9/11?</b></p><p>I was in a different high school. At that time, I worked in Jamaica High School in Queens, so I saw it from the other side of a river.</p><p><b>Did that experience change your experience of this at all?</b></p><p>It’s difficult to say. I should say yes, because since then, we’ve gotten all sorts of trainings. Our whole society is more alert. At that time, we weren’t informed that easily.</p><p><b>Has the administration contacted you?</b></p><p>The principal called me! And even after that, he gave me his personal phone number and asked me to call him anytime. They are very concerned, and they are very supportive. Also, my colleagues are very supportive too. I am here and they always ask me not to do anything and whatever I want to be done, they will do it for me (He chuckles). It’s very moving.</p><p><b>Have you been emotionally affected by this?</b></p><p>Yes. I’m extremely scared. I have never been in such a situation where two people have died right in front of me. I still can’t comprehend the situation. Two bicycle riders were, just a moment ago, alive people, and now they’re lying there, lifeless. It’s very difficult to deal with. That’s part of the reason I want to be with people. To be stabilized by people. After all, we are social animals.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:00:28.374291	27	1	
214	Regarding My Experience on October 31st, 2017	regarding-my-experience-on-october-31st-2017	<p>Screeches and then a loud bang. Car crash, was my first thought. I moved from my group of costumed friends to the staircase to see what the commotion was. Smoke from the crushed front of the pickup truck. Black oil spilled all over. I waited, pensively. All traffic on the West Side Highway had slowed to a crawl. A group of ten or so middle schoolers had gathered on the other side of the street. </p><p>Why was no one going to help the person inside get out? I kept thinking. I waited, expecting the person to stagger out or some altruistic individual to step up. Suddenly, the door banged open, and the man inside leaped out. I vividly remembered his golden handgun being the only thing I could focus on. He looked all around with his handguns pointed, looking for a target, wildly turning. I was frozen. Holy [expletive], I thought, he’s going to kill somebody. Someone behind me screamed, “He’s got a gun,” and I heard shrieks and footsteps taking off back into the school. I was still glued watching. He looked at the group of kids at the other side of the street, and strode towards them. I wish I could say I did something heroic, like turn his attention away from the kids, or that I threw something at him, but I just turned around towards Stuyvesant, and sprinted through the metal doors back into school. </p><p>I was herded by Mr. Tillman and the school police officers into the Student Union room. I went to the windows and watched as the police cars swarmed around the crashed truck. After several minutes of craning my neck to see, someone pointed out the two bodies on the bike pathway and the crumpled, strewn Citi Bikes. Police officers crowded over the bodies. Everyone was asking where the ambulance was. When the police officers brought out the white plastic covers, the questions stopped.</p><p>I live by Stuy, and the next night, as I was walking home, I decided to check out the deathbeds of those lost on that day. There was a police officer every 10 steps. There was a police officer stationed at the bloodstain of the biker. The police officer, a 35-year-old man with dark eyes, nodded at me and looked away. I sat down on the side, staring at the darker part of the concrete. The closest I had been to death before was with my great-grandparents, and that was when I was much younger. I don’t know how I feel. I’m still stuck with a lot of questions. I don’t think many of them will be answered anytime soon.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 20:49:07.363018	11	1	
215	Speed of Life	speed-of-life	<p>9/11. I always knew that it was an extremely sensitive topic to discuss. Every year at school, all my teachers would talk about how terrible and traumatizing that day was, how firefighters from the five boroughs were brave enough to go to the World Trade Center, and all of those kinds of comments. I practically have it memorized like a tape recorder. I get it. 9/11 destroyed our nation’s sense of immortality. I almost felt guilty that I didn’t feel as bad as all those people who lived through it. I was merely an infant—I didn’t really live through 9/11. It just felt like the world had always had increased, dramatic security and Islamophobia—all caused by a day in infamy that happened years ago. Isn’t it a little too much? 9/11 wasn’t really a day of infamy for me. But the Halloween of 2017? That was real. That was my day of infamy.</p><p>I was so excited to see my friends that day. I was 16 years old, full of life, only expecting to see the best of New York City. I was ready to make fun of my friends’ “hard-worked” costumes. That afternoon, I walked across Tribeca Bridge, which was normal as ever. I didn’t see any unusual activity. But as I descended the steps of Tribeca Bridge, a row of curious young faces started approaching my direction. All eyes were on me... or so I thought. As curiosity turned to concern, I finally looked at what was behind me—what everyone was actually looking at: a car accident. I couldn’t really pinpoint what my eyes were seeing. The white pickup truck looked like a black hole. A huge cloud of smoke rose from the vehicle. I tried analyzing what had actually happened. Instead, a few burning ash particles went inside my eye. Everyone was still looking at the incident.</p><p>I started moving away from the scene, thinking it was insignificant. I was mid-conversation with my friend when I suddenly heard somebody shout, “He’s got a gun!!” My ears couldn’t believe what they were hearing. He’s got a what? All the memories of 9/11, of Sandy Hook, and of Paris started racing through my mind like crazy. Instinct took over me. I started running further away from the scene, with a few other confused teenagers. However, my friend thought otherwise. “Maybe it’s just a couple of freshmen who wanted to pull a prank,” he said. Maybe. But that wasn’t a good reason to risk death. I always wondered what I’d do if I was the main character in a suspenseful movie, and I’d have to run for my life. Well now, this was it. I continued running. My friend ran along with me.</p><p>Breathe in, and out, in, and out. I ran past West Broadway and Church Street, intersections at Chambers Street. Four gunshots. Those were bullets, my friend shouted. We started running even faster, jaywalking and petrified with fear. The situation became even more dire. I passed Church Street onto Broadway. I heard some more shouts—was it safe? Please, please don’t tell me I didn’t run fast enough. Turns out, my calculator, its batteries, and a few books had fallen out of my backpack. A young man said, “Ma’am! Your book-bag is opened!” The man picked up all of my fallen belongings and kindly handed them to me. “Take it easy, Ma’am,” he said. I couldn’t run anymore with my hands full of batteries and books, so I walked more slowly. My friend waited for me near City Hall. I asked him to hold my stuff while I called my dad. I panicked as I spoke to him and couldn’t formulate words correctly.</p><p>At the City Hall station, I relaxed a little bit more and took out my Metrocard, but I clearly wasn’t relaxed because I had trouble swiping it correctly. My hands were trembling. I didn’t really talk with my friend. The sound of the bullets and shouts were still fresh in my memory.                    </p><p>I got off at 14 Street-Union Square to take the L train. Everyone around me just acted so normal, like everything was okay. Everything was not okay. How could they all just stand there typing on their phones? Suddenly I heard some more sirens from aboveground. People just obliviously glanced up and then looked back down at their phones. No one on this platform had the knowledge that I had. My eyes started swelling with tears, which then started streaming from my eyes. I was scared to death, and nobody knew about it.</p><p>I greeted my family with hugs and sobs. I told them about what happened to me, and they asked me how I felt. How I felt? I didn’t really feel a feeling. I felt like I was in some parallel universe, or a movie scene—the director was going to say, “Cut!” at any moment. But the director never appeared. This scene was too surreal.</p><p>The city isn’t as great as it seems, my parents said to me. But they were wrong. I love New York City. I love New York City more than I love anything else in my life: my school, my friends, and even my own family. But I have seen the best and worst of my favorite city. I once said to a friend, I’ve never had a bad experience. Yet, on that day, I experienced terrorism. And because of that, I will never be the same person. And? Well, that transformed me. I never thought New York City would experience terrorism again, especially after 9/11. I always thought I would be safe in NYC’s bubble and that life was like a box of chocolates—sweet and fulfilling. That day, however, surprised me. I’m sure it surprised the younger children it affected even more. Nobody should ever feel like a situation means life or death. Nobody should feel like their city can’t protect them in times of crisis. I’m even more passionate about stopping terrorism and crime, because if I have learned one thing from this experience—it’s that bad things do happen, but nonetheless, our city will remain strong.</p>	108	5	f	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-11-26 20:50:15.323176	11	1	
258	﻿Staff Editorial, Volume CVIII Issue 5	staff-editorial-volume-cviii-issue-5	<p>During 10th period on October 31, The Spectator Editorial Board was celebrating Halloween in room 639, on the west side of the building. We were distracted by candy, college apps, and talk about our next issue. While some students were facing horrors no high schooler should have to, we only began to learn of the attack from Snapchat stories and Twitter feeds. We were able to follow the news minute by minute from inside our classroom, occasionally reading inaccurate accounts during the preliminary stages of the investigation.</p><p>Most students had a very different experience. Some were on the Tribeca Bridge or on the wall, some were watching out the window, and some heard gunshots. Some teachers continued to teach their classes. Although every student in the building was on the same block as the attack, we were isolated through the well-enforced three-hour lockdown, sealing us off from the incident. You can find many of their stories in their own words throughout this issue.</p><p>Though the attack has been covered heavily in the media, Stuyvesant’s role has been largely overlooked. Students provided much of the footage and photographs used by police and media outlets. The first floor of the building was used as a command center for the investigation and hosted the mayor and governor as they were briefed on the events of the afternoon. The exterior of the school was used as a backdrop for press conferences. Most of all, the event has a lasting effect on students, though reactions have differed greatly among individuals.</p><p>Students have cried, students have made jokes, students have posted long reflections on their social media accounts. The various ways that students have expressed their feelings on the subject have prompted many to question others’ reactions. While some do not hesitate to call jokes inappropriate, others have used humor to distract themselves from the gravity of the events. Everyone copes differently, and the way one expresses him- or herself on the outside does not always reflect how he or she is feeling on the inside. Inappropriate responses do exist, but the line is not easily drawn. Despite the differences, the majority of the school came together on Wednesday, November 1, to wear black in mourning for the victims, a show of solidarity and support that transcends individual opinions.</p><p>And to freshmen, this incident should not cast a dark shadow on your four years at Stuyvesant. This attack has clearly made us aware of transgressions against our safety—bringing terrorism to our doorstep. It is understandable to be afraid. Yet, in light of this, we celebrate the overwhelming strength and compassion that the school at large responded with to the terrible attack. This solidarity comes without surprise to the upperclassmen of the school. The Stuyvesant community—from teachers to students—will be here for you in this time of distress.</p><p>We have dedicated this issue of the paper to the attack to show our school’s response and to provide an outlet for students. This is not about getting the best story or making waves, this is about representing our school and its experiences in the wake of an event that has affected all of us.</p><p>Countless tasks have gone unappreciated, performed by teachers, administration, first responders, and more. They have stayed up until nearly midnight planning for our safety, and despite being equally impacted by Tuesday’s events, they have carried out the everyday tasks that keep our school running.</p><p>Thank you to Principal Eric Contreras, Assistant Principal of Organization Jeremy Rynders, Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey Pedrick, Assistant Principal of Health and Physical Education Brian Moran, and the countless other administrators who helped organize the school’s response.</p><p>Thank you to the teachers, who waited for us in our classrooms, administered the evacuation, and provided support the next day.</p><p>Thank you to the School Safety Officers and NYPD, who always put our safety, and the safety of the city, before their own.</p><p>Thank you to the counselors and the United Federation of Teachers, who have helped students and staff recover from Tuesday’s tragic events.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has helped us through the past week.</p><p>The Stuyvesant Spectator Editorial Board</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:00:51.569859	27	1	
259	﻿Remember, But Don't Remind	remember-but-don-t-remind	<p>An often forgotten aspect of many terrorist attacks and mass shootings is how to deal with their aftermath. Often, these attacks happen in places that are used regularly and serve an essential purpose to a community, such as Sandy Hook Elementary School or the Mother Emanuel Church. Similarly, the attack on the Hudson River bike path is particularly challenging to deal with because it happened in a public, heavily-used area.</p><p>Different places have responded differently to violent conflicts. After the devastation at Sandy Hook, the school was torn down completely and a new one was rebuilt. At Columbine High School, the library—the main scene of the trauma—was rebuilt into an atrium. On the other hand, an Arizona Safeway where six people, including a Congresswoman, were shot reopened just a week later.</p><p>When it comes to the site of last week’s horror, the best course of action is to leave the bike path as is. While it is important that the people who died are remembered, memories don’t have to be set in stone—they will always be in our hearts and minds.</p><p>This is a response of resilience, not amnesia. By showing that Americans will continue to bike up and down the path just as they did before, we demonstrate to terrorists that the people of New York City will not be intimidated. Stuyvesant students will continue to hang out at the scene of this carnage just as they did before.</p><p>By the end of the week after the attack, the heavy media presence in the area and the bouquets of flowers honoring those who perished will be gone. We shouldn't etch the memories of this traumatic incident in stone: creating a constant reminder of the pain people felt on that horrible day helps no one. Students and teachers want to get over this distressing experience, not relive it everyday.</p><p>Instead, we must show how acts of violence will not affect our collective psyche. The bike path reopened the day after the attack, and right away, Citi Bikes were riding down the path.</p><p>The day after the attack, rather than missing school to recover, everyone came in for a mostly normal day of classes. Many teachers did not even feel the need to mention the attack to their students. Ultimately, teachers and students desire a return to normalcy. No one will forget what happened on Tuesday. It will continue to weigh very heavily on my mind. That memory is all we need: the school doesn’t have to erect a monument for us to feel the pain that we all felt on Tuesday.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:02:18.447098	27	1

Students lined up beside tables covered in multi-color tablecloths, in the hopes of partaking in arts-and-crafts activities or viewing poster boards.</p><p>The Earth Day Fair focuses on a specific environmental issue each year, and this year’s topic was American environmental policy. Members of the Environmental Club worked in groups to create presentations, with topics ranging from oil drilling to the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. “[The Earth Day Fair’s goal] is to raise awareness in Stuyvesant so our  students can go out there and make a change in the society through their voices,” sophomore and Environmental Club secretary Kenny Wong said.</p><p>After investigating water regulatory policies such as the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants in certain waters, freshman and Environmental Club member Derek Lao became quite familiar with the subject. “I believe that the US has taken amazing actions to make sure the quality of our water is in check,” he said. “However, there are still bodies of waters in the United States that are hazardous due to the amount of pollutants [and] I feel that more can still be done.”</p><p>This kind of information was shared with attendees of the fair both through Club members’ presentations and through other activities.         “One of the highlights of the fair was the seed planting. [...] It's a great experience to learn how to plant,” freshman George Zhou said.</p><p>The fair also included entertainment such as a StuyFlow demonstration and a student juggling performance.</p><p>The Environmental Club hopes to improve upon the fair next year. “We weren’t looking to partner with other clubs this year, [but] that would be our idea next year,” Wong said.</p><p>In the meantime, the Environmental Club has many other events planned to raise awareness and improve the environment. These initiatives include terracycle bins, the billion oysters project, a rooftop garden, and a toner recycle program.</p>	107	15	f	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-11-27 06:07:52.444052	1	1	The Environmental Club hosted the annual Earth Day Fair, with the goal of raising awareness on critical environmental issues.

You will love spending an excessive amount of time blankly staring at your article,</b> hoping that some text will magically appear. It cannot be guaranteed, however, that it will be something coherent. You might slip in a “screw you, editor” somewhere in the article.</p><p>More likely, though, you will type “uriehfliuwer” after you fall into a deep slumber. If you were writing for the Arts and Entertainment, Opinions, or Sports departments, “uriehfliuwer” would most likely be published.</p><p><b>2. You will enjoy seeing your article plastered all over the floor of the bridge.</b> In an ultimate sign of veneration, students will trample over your article. “When I walk all over The Spectator, it becomes the ground I stand on,” senior August Hochman said.</p><p><b>3. You can write absolutely anything you want.</b> Posting about the Greyducks in all four Dear Incoming Facebook groups? Why not also write three 1000-word articles? Want to curse teachers for assigning homework? (How could they?!) Feel free to write a news article on the true plight of being a Stuyvesant student. Back it up with statistics such as “99 percent of second-term seniors surveyed believe that teachers should let students cut class.”</p><p><b>4. You will drastically improve your speed-writing skills.</b> When your editor interrogates you about the status of your article five-and-a-half days after the due date, you will develop a supernatural ability to fabricate a 2000-word article replete with seven interviews in under an hour. Your impressed editor will gladly oblige in rewriting half of the article.</p><p><b>5. You will not have to fret about finding journalistic sources for interviews.</b> Certainly, quotes serve no real purpose; everyone’s intentions can be implied.

221	﻿Stuyvesant Celebrates Día de Los Muertos In Honor of 10/31 Victims	stuyvesant-celebrates-dia-de-los-muertos-in-honor-of-10-31-victims	<p>Colorful decorations, delicious food, and festive music filled the fifth floor halls during the Foreign Language Department’s Día de Los Muertos celebration on Thursday, November 2. Día de Los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, is a Mexican holiday to celebrate ancestors and lost loved ones.</p><p>The event was put together by Spanish teacher Abigail Carpenter with help from the rest of the Spanish teachers. “Carpenter started this [last year], which we [hoped would] be a tradition. She is an excellent organizer,” Spanish teacher Frida Ambia said.</p><p>The students in Carpenter’s four classes were also instrumental. They helped create and set up the decorations for the celebration. In addition to the colorful skeletons and paper garlands covering the walls of the fifth floor, students made a traditional Mexican altar.</p><p>Traditionally, the altar is created in someone’s honor. After the terrorist attack on Tuesday, October 31, the students in Carpenter’s classes decided to dedicate the altar to those who passed away in the attack. “I thought the tribute was really sweet. I think it was really important that the victims were commemorated and really nice that the Spanish Department thought to do that,” freshman Jessica Kwok said.</p><p>Throughout the day and after school, many students came to see the decorated floor. “The highlight was definitely the fifth floor because it was so beautifully decorated. All the bright colors and decorations were just extraordinary and made each morning great,” junior Kathryn Jano said.</p><p>“[Carpenter] painted faces for the students, which I think most of the students really enjoyed,” Ambia said.</p><p>Spanish classes also held small celebrations in their classes on November 2. They went outside to look at the altar, and during class they listened to and sang Spanish music.</p><p>Some students also made pan de muerto, which roughly translates to “Dead Bread,” a traditional food that is eaten on Día de los Muertos. “In the classroom, it was extremely fun to learn about it, especially the traditions. The recipes [for the food] were also extremely fun to make,” Jano said.</p><p>Many students enjoyed the celebration and also learned more about the holiday. “I learned about how different cultures are able to appreciate and celebrate those who have passed away. Seeing how food is a major part of Día de Los Muertos was very interesting,” junior Francis Park said.</p><p>Carpenter thought that the event was a success, as well. “It was just fun, and not everyone understood why we did it or what for, but it was still really fun to see people participate and just have a really good time. That was a tough week after everything that happened on Tuesday, so to be able to just take our minds off it and relax, that was special. It was pretty and festive,” she said</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:21:05.525179	1	1	The Spanish Department held a celebration for “Día de Los Muertos” on the fifth floor on Thursday, November 2.

The run was organized by the Stuyvesant Homeless Coalition and the Wellness Council and was sponsored by Clif Bar & Company. The event was in support of Back On My Feet, a non-profit organization that provides homeless people with resources.</p><p>The event is an important part of the Homeless Coalition’s strategy to encourage students to reach out to homeless people. “The run is really important because we were spreading homelessness awareness when the weather is starting to get colder and rates of homelessness are exponentially growing in NYC and nationally,” senior and president of the Stuyvesant Coalition Anna Pacheco said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>This was the first time that the Wellness Council worked with the Homeless Coalition to coordinate an event. “We joined the event because it’s a run, so it promotes wellness in the Stuy community,” junior and event department head of the Wellness Council Sophia Day said.</p><p>To advertize the run, the clubs convinced teachers to give extra credit to those who participated. “We contacted a lot of teachers to offer extra credit for the run. [Many] teachers also share the same belief that running is a great way to promote proper well-being, and that through running, a lot of their students would learn either something related to their field or just a healthy practice overall,” junior and president of the Wellness Council Jerry Ye said.</p><p>Students who wanted to participate were able to sign up beforehand and choose to run either one or two miles. The participants had to sign in before starting the run and sign out when they finished. The runners also received complimentary CLIF bars from the event organizers.</p><p>“The run was different from other years because there were way more people,” Pacheco said. “We had more goodies to give out thanks to [physical education teacher Peter] Bologna.”</p><p>Despite the turnout at the run, the event organizers fell short of their fundraising goal. The Homeless Coalition is passing out pamphlets to encourage students to keep donating to organizations that help the homeless. “We didn’t raise as much money as we wanted,” Pacheco said. “One of our members at the homeless coalition matched the money we did make, so we raised $300 in total.”</p><p>Students will have many more opportunities to support the Homeless Coalition and to contribute to their cause. The club will be holding a shoe drive and a book drive before the end of the year.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:22:09.672276	1	1	The Homeless Coalition, in partnership with the Wellness Council, held its second annual Homeless Coalition Charity Run on Friday, November 17.
223	﻿Israeli Defense Forces Come to Speak at Stuyvesant	israeli-defense-forces-come-to-speak-at-stuyvesant	<p>Two former Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers - Keren, a Jewish woman, and Tom, a Bedouin Arab - described their experiences while serving on Wednesday, October 25.</p><p>The event was organized by the Jewish Student Union (JSU). Senior and co-president Caleb Smith-Salzberg worked with Stand With Us, a pro-Israel educational organization, to arrange for the IDF soldiers to speak. “I am an intern at Stand With Us. They provide us with some potential speakers, and I thought that bringing soldiers to speak at a public school would be really cool and a good experience for a lot of students,” Smith-Salzberg said.</p><p>Unlike in most other countries, military service in Israel is mandatory at age 18 for both men and women. Men are required to serve for three years while women serve for two years. Arab Israelis are not required to serve; however, some volunteer for the draft.</p><p>Keren, a Jewish woman born in Israel, moved to New Jersey with her family when she was two years old and attended a public school in the state. Nevertheless, Keren always felt that Israel was the homeland for the Jewish people.</p><p>When she was 16, Keren decided to return to Israel. She lived with her grandmother in Israel until she joined the IDF at age 18. “The reason that I really wanted to join the IDF was because my family [had] been serving in the IDF and protecting Israel for three generations,” Keren said.</p><p>Upon joining the army, Keren began training to become a drill sergeant. “It was my dream job, perfect for my personality: yelling at people,” Keren said. She was injured two weeks before completing her training and had to shift to an office job with the army. Keren served in the Gaza border, a small strip of territory that lies between Egypt and Israel and the site of perpetual conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>While serving in the army, Keren experienced being less than a kilometer away while missiles were being launched into Israel from Gaza. “There was this insane siren that shook us up, warning us that we had up to 15 seconds to run [to the next bomb shelter]. What we thought was going to be a 15-minute annoyance turned out to be a six hour night. It was terrifying,” she said.</p><p>Though Keren was discharged in November 2013, she continues to feel connected to the IDF and the paratroopers she worked with. During the Israeli incursion into Gaza in 2014, Keren described her feelings of helplessness and fear for the soldiers she had worked with. “I couldn’t believe that my babies […] were on the battlefield, protecting me and my family and the country we love so much,” she said.</p><p>Today, Keren is a student at Ben Gurion University, delving into topics such as Middle Eastern Studies, Politics, and Government. As part of a scholarship, she worked with Arabs and Jews and encouraged them to work with each other. “It's two groups of people that usually wouldn’t meet each other, and they got a chance to meet and become friends [...] even if they couldn’t speak the same language” Keren said.</p><p>In turn, Keren has started to develop new perspectives on the people on the other side of the Arab-Israeli conflict. “I had my own stereotypes. When I met with Arab Muslims [who] believed exactly what I believed, it was a wake up moment. The stereotypes were ridiculous. We don’t have to fight each other, and we can make peace with [each] other,” Keren said.</p><p>Tom, an Israeli Bedouin Arab, grew up in Bir al-Maksur, the largest Bedouin village in Israel. Bedouins are traditionally a nomadic Muslim group. In spite of the tensions between Jews and Muslims, Tom knew he wanted to join the IDF, as his father and brother had done before him. “[I joined] because [I felt] a sense of duty to protect the country that [I] grew up in,” Tom said.</p><p>Tom served in the air force with an anti-aircraft unit, which later worked on the Iron Dome, a missile defense system that detects, assesses, and intercepts rockets, artillery, and mortar that are shot at Israel. He was stationed in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory, where he faced molotov cocktails and stone throwing on a daily basis.</p><p>On one occasion, Tom arrested a Palestinian man who intended to launch a terrorist attack on Jews. When Tom questioned the man, he explained that he was doing it for his family. Tom was told that the Palestinian government gives monthly payments to the families of terrorists, yet those imprisoned by Israel are well fed and taken care of.</p><p>After experiencing life in the IDF, Tom is now a student who works with a nonprofit to physically train teenagers for their military service. Like Keren, Tom believes that everyone, irrespective of his or her religion, can cooperate and work together to create peace. “I believe that each [...] of us have a unique voice. We can work together toward our common goal,” Tom said.</p><p>Many of the students at the event enjoyed listening and learning from the soldiers. “I thought that the speakers were really cool. Since one of them lived in New Jersey her whole life, we could relate to her more and learn about her experience and transition going to Israel,” senior and vice-president of the JSU Elizabeth Chernob said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:26:11.247662	1	1	A Jewish woman and an Arab man came to Stuyvesant to talk about their experiences as soldiers in the Israeli army.
224	﻿Senior Caucus Hosts Second Annual Pep Rally	senior-caucus-hosts-second-annual-pep-rally	<p>It was almost like a scene out of a movie: during the second annual Pep Rally on Friday, November 3, the Stuyvesant Peglegs ran into the third floor gymnasium and broke through a banner that read #StuyStrong. The event was organized by Senior Caucus President Pallab Saha and Vice President Abie Rohrig  It was held in the third floor gymnasium and featured dance and cheer performances, as well as a dodgeball tournament.</p><p>Rohrig and Saha came up with the idea of having Stuyvesant’s first Pep Rally last year to lighten their class’s mood and raise school spirit as they felt morale was being dampened by heavy coursework.</p><p>Inspired by the success of last year’s Pep Rally, Rohrig and Saha decided to continue the tradition. “We were very happy with the Pep Rally last year. Over 230 people attended and we got lots of positive feedback, so we thought it would be wonderful to continue the tradition,” Saha said.</p><p>The planning for the Pep Rally began about a month in advance, with support from school administrators, including Athletic Director Peter Bologna.</p><p>It was held soon after the terror attack that occurred near Stuyvesant on Tuesday, October 31. Saha and Rohrig hoped it would help unite the Stuyvesant community. Principal Eric Contreras, who gave the initial remarks, added a minute of silence and spoke briefly about the solidarity and spirit of the Stuyvesant community after the terror incident. “This event was meant to benefit the school by giving the student body something to rally around, especially after the terrorist attack on Halloween. We felt that the event would be a platform for students to show their Stuyvesant grit and unity in an extremely profound way,” Saha said.</p><p>Members of the Peglegs also recognized the significance of this year’s Pep Rally falling so closely after the terror attack. “Especially after the attack earlier in the week, it felt amazing to be at the center of something that brought our school community together. Stuy can sometimes seem too big to have cohesive school spirit but the turnout proved me wrong. I hope we only get stronger from here and the event is a special way to achieve this,” junior and Pegleg member Ariel Melendez said.</p><p>“In my opinion I think more people attended the Pep Rally and attended the football game. More alumni attended the football game that day to feel like a family, to feel close together in that regard,” Bologna said. “There is no specific mascot for the school, a lot of the sports teams are not very highly promoted, or not many students come to see the sports programs in this school, so I think this is a way to showcase some of the teams, some of the accomplishments of the teams in the school.”</p><p>One of the highlights of the Pep Rally was a performance by Stuy Legacy, Stuyvesant’s competitive urban dance team, who debuted their new routine. The performance was followed by rounds of dodgeball between students of all grades levels. Each grade competed in brackets, until the Class of 2018 was the ultimate victor. This was then followed by another round of dodgeball between seniors and teachers, which ended with another senior victory.</p><p>“Holding another pep rally during our tenure as Senior Caucus is definitely doable. However, we are open to many different options. [Rohrig] and I are working meticulously in trying to find various other ways to celebrate Stuy athletics, and those ideas may come to life soon enough. But we urge our successors to continue our legacy and host at least one pep rally every year,” Saha said.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:27:10.565282	1	1	Stuyvesant held its second annual pep rally on Friday, November 3 with highlight performances from Stuy Legacy, cheer and dodgeball games.
227	﻿Three Solutions for Canada’s Mounting Refugee Crisis	three-solutions-for-canada-s-mounting-refugee-crisis	<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength[.] #WelcomeToCanada” in January. Compare this to President Donald Trump, who tweeted, “I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016” just a year before. Canada currently has an immigration policy that is much more permissive of refugees, which has led to a mammoth influx of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, with around 10,000 coming across the border in July alone. While Canada welcomes these refugees with open arms, strain is showing—there is currently a backlog of over 40,000 refugees awaiting hearing, with some having arrived before 2012. In Quebec, the province with the most displaced people, the refugee acceptance rate has fallen as low as 50 percent over the last year. There, the city of Montreal has set up 1,500 beds to be filled with displaced immigrants, half of whom could be turned away.</p><p>Canada has its heart in the right place, and I propose three policy solutions for this problem of immigration.</p><p>First, the process that grants hearings to refugees should be less rigorous. These types of reforms have been played with in the past, such as when Parliament drafted and passed legislation that removed the requirement for lengthy hearings for refugees from seven Middle Eastern countries, including Yemen and Burundi, in response to humanitarian crises there. This legislation could be extended to the bulk of refugees with great success, as it removes the need for the longest part of the vetting process.</p><p>However, while the legislation didn’t have any noticeable drawbacks then, some would argue that expanding immigration policies to allow a much greater number of refugees might allow entrance to some with dubious refugee status or a prior criminal record. For instance, in response to an increasing number of Somali criminal deportations from the United States, a small number of criminals from Somalia have been claiming refugee status and coming across the border under false identities. But these examples are the exception rather than the norm, and the reward of productive new members of society would outweigh the risk of a few criminals.</p><p>Next, Trudeau should put his money where his mouth is and increase funding for the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), with the only real downside being the cost. Because such a large scale migration from the U.S. is completely unprecedented, Canada’s system is unprepared for the number of immigrants coming across the border. The Board currently only has enough manpower to hold a maximum of 24,000 hearings per year, not nearly enough for the thousands that cross the border monthly. Furthermore, the costs would be offset by the economic benefits: getting immigrants and refugees employed and paying taxes as permanent residents as quickly as possible. It’s irresponsible for Trudeau to welcome such a large amount of immigrants into a country that isn’t ready to handle them. He needs to make sure that Canada is able to accept them as quickly as possible.</p><p>The last option for Canada might be counterintuitive, but it may in fact alleviate a lot of the strain on the system: limiting the flow of refugees until the backlog has been resolved. Canada can actually take it more slowly than many think. Over 90 percent of deportations are done in states that don't border Canada. Thus, it's possible for Canada to temporarily limit or cease refugee action across the border until the situation becomes more manageable. Of course, there would be exceptions, such as a response to the recent threats from the Trump administration against Haitian refugees living in America, 8,500 of which crossed the Canadian border in August. Limiting the flow of immigrants and letting specific, threatened groups through buys time for the system to fix the mounting backlog and stop the type of bureaucratic limbo that 40,000 people are living in today. However, this is a temporary fix on its own, because when the backlog is eliminated Canada will have two choices: go back to their previous policy and let it mount up again, or stick to the less permissive one, a secondhand version of America’s much harsher policy towards illegal immigrants.</p><p>The third solution cannot stand alone. Instead, it’s designed to create a blank slate for the implementation of one or both of the other two solutions and prioritize the vetting of those who have waited for years to be recognized as members of society. The current backlog is the most pressing issue right now and the people it’s made of deserve to be put through the system first, but if refugees are to be limited until the backlog is gone, Canada needs to adopt either or both of the other solutions to streamline the immigration progress. Canada must first stabilize the system by fixing the backlog, but after that, Trudeau must either do away with a portion of the vetting process or give more money to the struggling IRB if he wants to realize his vision of a truly welcoming Canada.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:32:14.620996	2	1	Canada’s current acceptance of refugees creates a threatening backlog of people who might be turned away at a moment’s notice.
229	﻿Russia Again?	russia-again	<p>After months of endorsements and almost $1.4 billion spent on campaign expenditures, a Hillary Clinton victory in the 2016 election seemed like a sure thing. Donald Trump’s shocking triumph took the whole country by storm; immediately after results were announced, Democrats rushed to invalidate them. Cries of collusion with Russia deemed the victory as undermining to American democracy. Lacking in substance as well as relevance, claims of Russian election interference still plague the Trump administration almost a year later. Though recent investigations have recovered definitive ties between Russia and a campaign, it certainly wasn’t Trump’s.</p><p>American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, who extensively investigated claims of collusion,  assured that "the same Russian lawyer who allegedly met with Trump’s son discovered that she [Clinton] was actually one of the unnamed sources for the Russian dossier." Clinton’s campaign (along with the DNC) essentially funded opposition research to be done by Fusion GPS, a foreign firm, and for it to be released as maliciously as possible in order to smear the Trump campaign. The organization is now in a legal battle with the United States government for refusing to show their bank records.</p><p>Clinton also tried to keep her campaign off the name of the organizations who funded the dossier. Studies by Mother Jones indicate that talk of the dossier had been around ever since October 2016, on which it was very vaguely put that the effort was “originally funded by Trump’s GOP opponents.” When it emerged in October 2017 that a very significant benefactor had, in fact, been the Clinton campaign, the dossier had already sparked much of the media’s attention. Clinton’s involvement was often de-emphasized by media trying to push a narrative that antagonized Trump.</p><p>But these sort of unethical tactics stretch all the way back to Clinton’s time with the Obama administration. From 2009 to 2013, Russia was trying to monopolize the uranium market by gaining control of a substantial amount of all uranium production capacity on American territory. Since uranium purchases have implications on national security, they must be approved by a committee composed of representatives from the United States government. Amongst those representatives was the Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton.</p><p>As Russians gradually assumed control of uranium production, Canadian records showed that an unprecedented cash flow made its way into the Clintons’s pockets. The chairman of Uranium One made four separate donations to the Clinton Foundation, totalling a whopping $2.35 million. Despite an agreement struck with the Obama administration to publicly identify all donors, this information remained disclosed until now.</p><p>Trump’s connections to Russia, in contrast, appear rather mild. His son, Donald J. Trump, met with a Russian lawyer during the heat of the campaign season. Other than a rather inconclusive e-mail and some false claims of the lawyer having access to “damaging information about Clinton,” the meeting was arguably none other than poorly handled opposition research. The lawyer ultimately didn’t provide the promised material on Clinton, and Trump Jr. fully disclosed the e-mails in a later tweet.</p><p>Even though this event was what began the Trump-Russia controversy, Trump’s campaign (and his presidency) was marred by many such dubious accusations. National Secretary Advisor Flynn—who has since been fired—was said to have communicated with Russian officials; however, the president wasn’t aware of nor directed any of the efforts Flynn potentially made. Even Trump’s meeting with Putin to simply discuss American-Russian relations at the G-20 summit was used as viable evidence of an unseemly alliance. According to “The Atlantic,” accounts from the meeting state, “Trump had pressed Putin hard about Russian interference.” The rest of the time was dedicated to talks of resolution for the conflict in Syria.</p><p>Trump’s administration is forced to spend time defending themselves against allegations, which can be better used to defend the country. Clinton’s goal was never to warn the American people of Russian collusion, which she’s been building up as the biggest threat to American democracy, and a force that shouldn’t be reckoned with. But maybe the biggest manifestation of this sort of corruption is Clinton herself; after all, she got herself more profit and Trump more bad publicity than ever before.</p><p>Months after the controversy, media outlets have exhausted the topic of Russian intervention in the election. Speculation concerning the “Russia scandal” has taken up an incredulous amount of their attention; in one airing of CNN’s “New Day,” 93 percent of air time was devoted to Russia and less than five percent was spent on the GOP’s new healthcare bill. This misdirected focus allows for the neglection of arguably larger issues afflicting our nation. Between some flimsy links and a suspicious e-mail exchange, there appears to be nothing of substance in regards to the Trump campaign’s involvement with Russia—that alone should have been very clear months ago.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:33:54.408863	2	1	Speculation concerning the “Russia scandal” has taken up an incredulous amount of their attention, and allowed for the neglection of arguably larger issues afflicting our nation.
226	﻿Chaos in Catalonia	chaos-in-catalonia	<spec-reference id=228></spec-reference><p>Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region in Northeastern Spain, has historically been influenced by French culture and customs. It remained independent from Spain until the fifteenth century, when the marriage of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile united most of the Spanish peninsula. Catalans have always maintained a strong sense of national pride, which only grew stronger in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This increasing national pride was repressed under the rule of the military dictator Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975.</p><p>After Franco’s death, Catalonia gradually regained its semi-autonomous status and grew into one of Spain’s wealthiest and most industrialized regions. Even in the modern world, historical and cultural tension exists between Catalans and their Spanish counterparts. Catalonia has its own culture and a language which is more similar to that of France than Spain. Historical rivalries between the Catalan and Spanish governments and the increasing influence of nationalism in Europe have combined to create a Catalan public that is distrustful, and even hostile, towards the Spanish government. This tension has reached a boiling point, with the regional Catalan government holding a referendum on whether or not Catalonia should secede from Spain.</p><p>In this point-counterpoint, Opinions writers examine whether or not Catalonia could and should secede from Spain.</p><p><hr></p><p>Americans are no strangers to the difficulties a fight for independence presents. In 1776, America successfully rebelled against the most powerful nation on Earth and went on to transform itself from a minor country on the world’s hinterlands into a global power. Over two centuries later, history seems to be repeating itself, this time in Spain.</p><p>Catalonia, a wealthy region of Spain with a proud history, is currently striving for independence. In what the Spanish government has declared an illegal referendum, Catalans overwhelmingly voted in support of secession in October 2017. Though Catalonia faces a long and arduous path to independence, Spain and the rest of the international community should recognize Catalonia as an independent country.</p><p>The underlying justification for the Catalan referendum is a basic right to self determination. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the cornerstone of modern international law, states that “All peoples have the right to self determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.”</p><p>Catalonia has the political and cultural traits necessary for independence. It already has its own police force, known as the Mossos d'Esquadra. It has its own flag, Parliament, and healthcare system. Catalonia even has a series of “missions,” which are de facto embassies that promote investment and trade with Catalonia.</p><p>Catalonia has its own language and regional culture that many of its citizens feel are not respected by Spain. This tension dates back to the 20th century rule of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who banned the Catalan language. In present times, Catalan is spoken by more people than other official EU languages such as Danish and Finnish, but it is still not acknowledged as an official language by Spain.</p><p>Despite this, Catalonia, its language, and its culture continue to thrive. Millions of books are written in Catalan every year. People across Spain are familiar with popular media outlets such as El Periódico, Catalunya Radio, and TV3—some of which have been threatened with a takeover by the Spanish government. Catalonia has hundreds of years of history, great cities such as Barcelona, and artists such as Salvador Dali to its name.</p><p>Beyond being an idealistic expression of democracy, independence is also a practical solution to the concerns shared by the Catalan people. Catalonia is one of Spain’s wealthiest regions, and it is home to nearly a fifth of its total population, making it larger than four of the EU’s 15 member states. It contributes 19 percent of Spain’s GDP and a fourth of its exports. In 2014, Catalonia paid almost $12 billion more to Spanish tax authorities than it received in government funding. This has enraged many Catalans who feel that they are being forced to “carry” Spain’s economy at their own expense.</p><p>If Catalonia were to secede, it would have a GDP of 215 billion euros, larger than that of Greece. Catalonia is a center of tourism, attracting nearly 18 million tourists a year. Its largest city, Barcelona, is Europe’s eighth most visited city. Approximately a third of Catalonia’s population has a college education. These characteristics would lay the groundwork for Catalan economic success. Though the unrest caused by the independence referendum has hurt the Catalan economy in the short term, the long term economic prospects for an independent Catalonia are bright.</p><p>In defiance of the Catalan people’s right to self determination, the Spanish government has declared the independence referendum unconstitutional and jailed eight Catalan officials on charges of rebellion and sedition. It is also seeking to arrest Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Catalonia who is currently in Belgium in order to avoid arrest.</p><p>The Spanish government’s repression of the voice of the Catalan people and democracy should be condemned by the international community. Its decision to violently attempt to prevent the vote, injuring over 900 civilians, is undemocratic, a throwback to Franco’s brutal dictatorship, and a stark reminder of how vulnerable democracy is.</p><p>Due to the chaos and violence surrounding the previous referendum and the subsequently low voter turnout, Spain should allow another independence referendum. This time, it would be legally binding and allow the Catalan people to vote without fear. A BBC analysis found that over 70 percent of Catalans support a referendum. As a democratic government, it is the Spanish state’s duty to give a voice to its constituents, including Catalans. Until the Spanish government permits a legally binding referendum on Catalan independence, it will continue to tarnish its own reputation and that of the democratic world as a whole.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:31:50.788096	2	1	The idea that all people have a right to the democratic process is one of the axioms of Western political theory.
228	﻿Catalonian Secession: A Regression for Europe	catalonian-secession-a-regression-for-europe	<spec-reference id=226></spec-reference><p>A strong national identity, a legacy of separation, and perceived economic unfairness were all factors when United Kingdom voters decided to leave the European Union in what is now known as Brexit. Great Britain is now set to leave the EU behind, along with its free trade and migration, for an uncertain economic future.</p><p>Catalonia, a province of Spain, is charting the same path. In a recent referendum held by the Catalonian government, voters chose independence, and the regional government declared its secession from Spain. While the Spanish government effectively crushed independence in the short term, temporarily revoking the province’s autonomy and arresting secessionist officials, the drive for independence is unlikely to be quelled for long. However, Catalonian independence would only hurt both Catalonia, Spain, and Europe.</p><p>First and foremost, Catalonia would probably be denied membership in the European Union. Accession would require the approval of all 28 member states, which is unlikely considering that all EU member states support the Spanish central government against Catalonia. Because two-thirds of Catalonia’s exports go to the EU (and one third go to Spain itself), EU membership should be a huge factor in the Catalan people’s decision to secede. The European Single Market provides Catalonia with access to 500 million consumers, but if Catalonia were independent, nations could impose high tariffs and other trade barriers on Catalan goods.</p><p>There are many other factors to consider, such as how the debt situation with Spain would be handled. Spain currently has a massive debt load, and it’s unclear whether Catalonia would have to assume some of that burden in an independence deal. There’s also the question of whether Catalonia would create its own currency or continue using the Euro. In the face of these uncertainties, multinational companies have already begun to relocate their head offices outside of Catalonia.</p><p>The now-deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has refused to recognize the difficulties and complexities that independence would bring, drawing a striking similarity to the rhetoric of populist politicians elsewhere in Europe, such as Nigel Farage.</p><p>The most decisive argument against independence for Catalonia is that most Catalans don’t actually support independence. While the latest referendum had a 90 percent vote for secession, it was conducted illegally, and the Spanish government urged “no” voters not to vote, resulting in a turnout of only 42 percent. In fact, prior to the beginning of the crisis, only 35 percent of Catalans supported full independence. Hundreds of thousands of protesters turned out in a pro-Spain rally on October 29; many of them were angry with the course of action the local Catalan government, the Generalitat, had taken. In fact, the Washington Post finds that around three-quarters of Catalans culturally identify with Spain, as well as Catalonia.</p><p>Catalonia’s role as a citizen within the European community also needs to be considered. Over the last two decades, the majority of Europe has come together in the belief that an international community of European countries would bring economic prosperity and maintain peace. That stability, however, relies on its 28 member states staying unified internally, both in their national and European identities.</p><p>However, this solidarity has shown major cracks. According to Pew Research, 51 percent of people within the European Union want their own countries in control of future trade deals, not the EU, and 53 percent want their own country to hold a referendum on continued membership. The most dramatic result of these pressures thus far was Brexit, reflecting the rising nationalism in Europe, with citizens increasingly wanting political and economic control to return to their own countries.</p><p>Catalonian independence isn’t an immediate rejection of the EU, but of Spain. However, the independence movement is inherently nationalistic, with supporters viewing themselves as Catalan, not Spanish. The success of this movement would send the message that the nation is the most important political unit in Europe. At a time when Europe faces crises such as a weak economy, uncertainty of U.S. commitment to European security, and the challenge of dealing with refugees, EU leadership provides solutions: improve the economy through the single market, centralize European militaries to fill a void left by the United States, and divide up the responsibility of handling refugees. Catalan independence would harm Catalonia, Spain, and Europe by splitting them at a time when unity is required in the face of adversity.</p><p>Spain’s handling of the Catalan referendum left much to be desired, with police violently repressing voters and voting officials, but that does not make independence a more promising future than unity with Spain. Though Catalonia has had its autonomy temporarily revoked in response to the crisis, beforehand, Catalonia enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy from the central government under the Constitution drawn up in 1978. Under this arrangement, the Catalan government had broad authority in matters regarding education, commerce, justice, public safety, and culture.</p><p>The Spanish government should restore Catalonia’s privileges and make an effort to resolve differences regarding the Constitution. Additionally, the Catalan government should try to cooperate with authorities in Madrid. There is no perfect solution to the problems facing Spain and Catalonia, but if both sides can come to an agreement, both Spain and Catalonia will be better off.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:32:45.558589	2	1	While Catalonia has legitimate grievances against Spain, independence would only hurt Catalonia in the long term.
225	﻿Behind the Scenes: Cheerleading	behind-the-scenes-cheerleading	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>For years, television has presented stereotypes that have defined cheerleading, causing us to conjure up the image of girly, shallow, popular mean girls. It’s easy to tell who’s a cheerleader because she’ll always have her uniform on. After school, cheerleading practice (that takes place after hours of preening in the bathroom) just consists of waving pom poms for an hour while looking pretty. But who could blame them. It’s not even a real sport.</p><p>All these stereotypes exist even at Stuyvesant to a certain degree; most students didn’t even know there was a cheerleading team until they were at the football homecoming game.</p><p>But this year, there is an unprecedented growth in the number of people joining cheerleading. A lot of the new members of the team are our high-achieving friends, often making us wonder what compelled them to join.</p><p><b>Challenging Stereotypes: Building a New Reputation</b></p><p>In the past, cheerleading didn’t have the best name. “Though I wasn't on cheer my freshman year, I know that there was a lot of issues with the team,” junior Xinyue Nam added. “Last year, the coach didn’t really try to grow the cheer team, and we didn’t go to competitions. We depended on the football team. We are so much more than just pretty girls, and guys, waving pom poms while shouting, ‘Let's go Stuy.’”</p><p>A lot of the cheerleaders had difficulty being able to have their parents respect their decision to join the team. Cheerleading is a costly sport that is underfunded and overlooked because of the team’s lack of success in the past. “Cheerleading is very expensive and it hurts that people don’t respect us. A lot of people have to pay for their cheer costs and our parents aren’t on board with things,” Nam revealed.</p><p>This lack of support causes many Stuyvesant cheerleaders to obtain money from after school jobs in order to stay on the team.</p><p>Furthermore, the commitment required to be a cheerleader is unanticipated and can cause a strain on a cheerleader’s social life. “To be honest, because I spent a lot of time in practice and other cheer-related events, I haven’t been able to spend much time with my friends. I think that they fully support me being on cheer, but sometimes, it’s hard to not talk to them for several days because I’m so busy with it on top of schoolwork and other clubs,” sophomore Angelina Chu said.</p><p>Now, with good advertising and people involved with Student Union on the team, the  influx of new members this year is challenging the typical stereotypes of what it means to be a cheerleader.</p><p>“Clearly, if we’re at Stuyvesant, I think you can tell that we don’t fit the stereotype,” senior Patricia Tan commented. Many members take AP classes and are involved in ARISTA, proving they still have the GPA to be at the top of their class.</p><p>In addition, cheerleading isn’t just waving pom poms around, because strength is a necessity for all the teammates. “You’re not just dancing and trying to look good,” sophomore and flyer Theresa Teng explained. “Especially if you are one of those people on the bottom, and you’re literally lifting people up. You need to be strong. We condition just like other teams.”</p><p>On the other hand, male cheerleaders are often labeled as gay. But junior Xinyue Nam has been on the cheerleading team since her first year at Stuyvesant, and she understands the crucial role of males like junior Kevin Zong on the team. “They are the glue of the team,” Nam said. “Our guys don't care about the stereotypes. It gets annoying, but we know these things.”</p><p><b>A Bond for Success</b></p><p>The bond that the team has can be clearly seen. “Cheer is really emotionally stressful sometimes, and I feel that a huge reason as to why we are so close is because we always somehow overcome the obstacles,” Zong said.</p><p>As we walk into the third floor atrium after tenth period, we see the cheerleaders warming up and practicing their impressive stunts. The beginning of typical practice doesn't stray far from an average baseball or football practice: stretching and warming up. These are necessary steps every athlete, including cheerleaders, must take in order to prevent injuries. During warmups, cheerleaders can be seen running laps around the school and reinforcing positive motivation to get each other through the tiresome workout. Afterwards, the members break off into their respective stunt groups and go straight to work. Many stunts are dangerous and consist of flyers getting lifted up into the air by the bases and backs supporting them. Typically, the male cheerleaders are at the base.</p><p>“We try to clean our dances, our cheers, and also work on new stunting skills to incorporate within our routine for Nationals,” Zong described. With improvement in stunts, flyers are learning how to do more intricate and difficult routines just in time for Nationals. For example, in a high to low tick tock, the flyer has to switch legs and end up standing on the opposite leg with the other leg bent.</p><p>Zong plays an extremely crucial role because he is one of seven males on the team. Being the “back” of routines, he's responsible for literally lifting up his teammates, a feat the average person cannot do. Before joining the team, Zong initially joined the PSAL Stunt team due to a friend recommending it. When Cheer season came around, he saw no reason to leave the family. “Cheer has become such a huge part of my life. I dedicate myself to it because I want to be part of something great,” Zong explained.</p><p><b>New Coach, New Goals, New Cheer</b></p><p>The introduction of Coach Nicholas O’Stanton has proven to have given the team more opportunities. Because Stuyvesant’s team wasn’t the only commitment the former coach had, he would only be able to come to one out of every few practices and didn’t allow stunting while he was absent. “Coach Nick comes to every practice, so we really have been able to progress in terms of stunts and skills. He really fosters our ability to prepare and set goals,” Tan explained.</p><p>A major change under Coach O’Stanton is the addition of a Junior Varsity (JV) team. “They tried to implement it last year, but it didn’t really work. This year, we have a total of over 50 people, which means we can definitely split it into Varsity and JV.” Tan said. If JV acquires the skill, they will also be competing at these competitions, but in their own division. In addition, with a new JV division, the team is a lot more organized.</p><p>This implementation is providing positive results rather than negative ones. Rather than unhealthy competition, the addition of a JV team is a providing a stronger team bond. “Many of the JV members are working hard to earn a spot in Varsity. I think that this helps motivate us and strive to always be the best that we can be,” Zong explained. Members in JV are with people that have similar skills and can help each other grow.</p><p>The greater opportunities for people to become more involved in cheer has led to the evolution of the team’s reputation because it is a lot more inclusive. In addition, cheerleading is attractive because it has so many members and radiates a sense of community to whoever might be interested in joining. The team’s growing integration into Stuyvesant’s culture can be seen with the performance at the pep rally as well as the creation of a future cheer club.</p><p>In addition to making them physically stronger, cheerleading challenges them mentally. Members have to dedicate themselves to improving and ignoring the judgement they receive on their physical appearances.  At competitions, members are evaluated on both their skill and physical appearance in front of large crowds. The long and frequent practices don’t ease this either because it adds a great deal of stress with a huge time commitment.</p><p>In prior years,  the team never competed at official competitions, so members are very excited because they’re focused on literally throwing people up in the air. The Stuyvesant High School Cheerleading Team will be competing at Regionals, hoping to bid there and get to the ultimate dream: Nationals.With the new coach, members finally have a target to aim for. “Coach Nick actually set [goals] in stone. ‘We’re going to Nationals,’ ‘This is the date we want to go to,’ so we’ve been working up to that goal of going to Nationals so far since the summer,” Tan said. “The idea of people taking us seriously at Stuyvesant once they hear that we bid at Regionals and potentially [go] to Nationals is a good thing to me.”</p><p>Currently, the team is already preparing to go to Nationals in Orlando around Christmas break of this year.</p><p><b>Moving Forward: Together as a Family</b></p><p>Reflecting on her past three years on the team, senior and captain Michelle Moe is</p><p>excited for the team’s upcoming season. “I’m looking forward to taking my team to Nationals, if we bid at Regionals,” Moe said. “I look forward to sharing the experience that a lot of cheerleaders across the country dream of with my favorite people.”</p><p>“I know that we have the potential to become great,” Zong said with enthusiasm. “So this year, I hope to take the ‘in’ out of ‘infamous’ and rise above what others think of us.”</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 10:33:22.963934	3	1	With the support of new Coach Nicholas O’Stanton and one goal in mind, Stuyvesant’s underrated cheerleaders are working harder and are more determined than ever.
260	﻿We Need To Do Better: Challenging Staff Apathy	we-need-to-do-better-challenging-staff-apathy	<p>“Hello everyone! Thank you for your patience! The shelter-in… does continue!”</p><p>A cacophony of groans drowns out the rest of the announcement that projects patronizing gratitude for how incredibly patient we’ve all been.</p><p>“Yo, I heard a freshman got shot.”</p><p>“Apparently four little kids from the elementary school were in the bus.”</p><p>“Did you hear about the lab assistant? What’s his name again?”</p><p>The room buzzes with chatter; some verbalizing updates from uncertain news sources, some on the phone with relatives, some complaining about how hungry they are, and some fidgeting, waiting for an announcement that will confirm or deny the rumors flying, or provide any kind of update at all.</p><p>This announcement is not forthcoming.</p><p>Entering Stuyvesant the next day, I notice the school has a somewhat muted quality to it. Not like the hallways echo less noise, but like someone threw a heavy afghan over us. From time to time, the P.A. blares. Counselors are in the theater. Counselors are in the theater. Counselors are in the theater. We float from room to room, waiting to hear what our teachers will tell us. Waiting for our teachers to guide us in our reactions and responses. Waiting for them to pay respects.</p><p>Many of us are still waiting.</p><p>For a school that claims to prioritize its students’ health and safety, the lack of an organized and empathetic response from the staff was disappointing, if not shocking. During the evening of the West Side attack, the administration’s policy of retaining necessary information would have been appropriate for an elementary school—not so much for a high school full of teenagers and adults with Internet access, social media, and the maturity and experience to understand the implications of a terror attack. This tactic may have been effective 30 years earlier, but not today, when the sheer terror of not knowing is amplified by a plethora of false news reports and frightened gossip. When the majority of the student body is bombarded with rumors and posts and is simultaneously infantilized by the administration, panic spreads—the very same panic the administration had been trying to avoid.</p><p>Even more upsetting was the lack of a collective decision from the staff on how the attack should be addressed in class—despite receiving and ignoring advice from the counseling department on how to broach the issue—which resulted in a variety of teacher responses. Some chose to act blasé, asking at the beginning of class, “Remember, if any of you feel too traumatized or distracted to focus on the lesson, just leave to counseling now… no one?” Others decided that the attacker didn’t deserve the attention of a class discussion and said as much before moving on to the planned lesson, leaving the question hanging in the air: What about the victims? Do they not deserve discussion either? Still others chose to pretend it didn’t happen at all, even having the audacity to administer a quiz the following day. Not all teachers were indifferent—there were teachers, particularly English teachers, who did allow their class to become a space of open discussion and free thought about the attack. It wasn’t until I had English myself that I realized the full absurdity of focusing on coding and equations and imperfect tenses when a literal terror attack had occurred in our front yard not even 24 hours earlier. It was an insult to our intelligence, but more importantly, it was an insult to the memory of the victims of the attack.</p><p>The point is that we’re resilient, right? In fact, we’re so resilient that a single P.A. update on the crisis happening 20 feet from our doors is clearly too much for us kids to handle, so we’re just going to frantically refresh Snapchat in desperate hope that not even one of the rumors is true. We’re not going to let this affect us, so we’re going to isolate this conversation in the theater and ignore it in the classroom. We’re going to trust that the teenagers of a competitive school will choose to seek support on their own in lieu of attending classes they can’t afford to fall behind on, taught by teachers so oblivious and unconcerned one would think they had slept through the past two days. We’re not going to mention eight dead people, or their mourning families, or the news crews colonizing two streets, or the students who didn’t come to school, or the students who really shouldn’t have come to school. We’re so resilient we’ve chosen to set an apathetic example for our students to follow—which many of them did. We’re going to keep moving forward into the same numbness that we criticized in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting—a legacy perpetuated by the staff and carried on by the student body. Somehow, by proving theorems and discussing Andrew Jackson’s contributions and failures during his presidency, we’re supposedly refusing to let “them” win—but the ultimate loss isn’t just ours, it’s that of the grieving families devastated and left unmentioned.</p><p>Of course, there isn’t a way to be prepared for every imaginable crisis. However, a news update and a more coordinated effort toward empathy and respect isn’t a special request, it’s a basic responsibility. If the Student Union can organize a school-wide gesture of respect for the victims of the West Side attack the night before, the staff can pause or postpone their lessons. We’re not asking for perfection, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expect the adults in charge of us to do better—or even, inconceivably, to care.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:02:51.456035	27	1	For a school that claims to prioritize its students’ health and safety, the lack of an organized and empathetic response from the staff was disappointing, if not shocking.
233	﻿What to Bring Back to Broadway	what-to-bring-back-to-broadway	<p>With musical remakes of “SpongeBob” and “Mean Girls” on their way to Broadway, theater followers have reason to be both skeptical and excited about the 2017-2018 Broadway season. In addition to these new productions, shows including “Carousel” and “Once On This Island” have returned to the spotlight. In satisfying the demand for iconic and nostalgia-inducing hits, revivals play a key role in keeping the theater industry alive. With today’s ever-changing social and political climate, returning shows can take on a new meaning and reiterate the importance of issues that have now become prevalent. Here’s a selection of shows that would rake in audiences and convey powerful messages if revived on Broadway.</p><p><b>Next to Normal</b></p><p><i>2009</i></p><p>Written by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, “Next to Normal” ran on Broadway for two years and earned three Tony Awards, as well as the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Centered around a mother with increasingly severe bipolar disorder, the musical stands out by providing a raw and honest depiction of how an individual and those around him or her can be affected by mental illness. Showing a range of perspectives, from that of overachieving and neglected daughter Natalie to frustrated yet determined husband Dan, “Next to Normal” stands out because it allows audiences of all ages and denominations to see themselves represented on stage. Many audiences were also intrigued by the show’s many parallels to “Dear Evan Hansen,” the musical that won this year’s Tony Award for Best Musical. With the issues of mental illness and dysfunctional family relationships constantly growing in prominence, a “Next to Normal” revival would increase awareness surrounding these issues and also further touch on the importance of not romanticizing poor mental health and treating it like any other chronic illness.</p><p><b>A Chorus Line</b></p><p><i>1975/2006</i></p><p>An iconic staple of musical theater, “A Chorus Line” follows the story of 17 dancers auditioning for a spot in a Broadway musical. After winning the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1975, the production was later revived in 2006, and many believe that it is due for another return to Broadway. One of the longest-running and more well-known musicals, a revival of “A Chorus Line” would be received with significant enthusiasm from fans of classic musical theater and balance the ratio of classic to contemporary and current shows that are trendy today. Centered around a critical element of showbusiness, the audition, the show depicts a timeless struggle that all performers can commiserate with. With all the elements of a standard Broadway musical, “A Chorus Line” would spark a renewed enthusiasm for more traditional shows and tell a heartfelt and timeless story to its viewers.</p><p><b>In the Heights</b></p><p><i>2008</i></p><p>Years before Hamilton’s rise to popularity, another musical by composer Lin-Manuel Miranda gained attention after it opened in February of 2008. Telling the story of three days in the life of a close-knit Latino community in Washington Heights, “In the Heights” was given the 2008 Tony Award for Best Musical. The production was criticized for its overly sentimental dialogue, but praised for its high energy and spirited score. The show also broke barriers by being one of the first major hip-hop musicals. In an industry that is dominated by tap dancing and big choral numbers, “In the Heights” stands out by bringing a different and exciting element to the stage. A return to Broadway could attract the attention of fans of “Hamilton” who want a show with a similar hip-hop influence. The themes of “In the Heights” are also especially relevant to the country’s current political tension. With many nods to the hardships and discrimination that surround the immigration process, a revival of “In the Heights” could speak volumes with its strong statements about issues that are extremely prominent in today’s society.</p><p><b>Heathers: The Musical</b></p><p><i>2014</i></p><p>Though never actually running on Broadway, the “Heathers” musical remake received considerable praise from audiences and fans of the 1988 cult classic film. The production’s dark yet humorous plot follows 17-year-old Veronica Sawyer, as she and her boyfriend accidentally murder the leaders of her popular clique in an effort to reduce her high school’s social tension. If finally given a Broadway run, the musical could rake in attention from younger audiences who yearn to see more representation of the high school experience on stage. With a catchy score and witty humor, the black comedy is sure to keep viewers entertained for a full two hours. Though the Off-Broadway production was positively received, many remarked that the show’s low budget resulted in an overly simple set design. A Broadway production of “Heathers: The Musical” would allow for a more dynamic set that would pair well with the other vibrant elements of the show, such as the soundtrack and heavily ‘80s-influenced costumes. Satisfying both lovers of the iconic film and teens that can relate to the show’s themes about the struggles of fitting in in high school, “Heathers: The Musical” is sure to be a hit if brought to Broadway.</p><p><b>Into the Woods</b></p><p><i>1987/2002</i></p><p>One of the many masterpieces of famed composer Stephen Sondheim, “Into the Woods” puts a dark spin on beloved fairy tales such as “Cinderella” and “Little Red Riding Hood.” Their whimsical storylines intertwine, as various characters journey on different quests through a threatening and mysterious forest and eventually team up to fight a murderous giant. Opening on Broadway in 1987, “Into the Woods” was later revived in 2002 and adapted into a film in 2014. Though the show has achieved large success on its many runs, many theater enthusiasts wish to see it make a comeback. Sondheim’s musicals are known for their fast-paced and tongue-tying scores, and “Into the Woods” is no exception. A notable favorite from the show is “Giants in the Sky,” a song that is known for being vocally hard to execute. If given a chance to make a resurgence, “Into the Woods” is sure to draw in those looking for a well-thought out musical with a story that is wild from start to finish.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:51:11.163576	18	1	A look at five shows that are due for a Broadway revival.
412	﻿Greater Stuyvesant Empire Proclaimed	greater-stuyvesant-empire-proclaimed	<p>The electrified atmosphere in the theater was palpable as senior and Student Union (SU) chancellor Tahseen Chowdhury walked on stage to address the Stuyvesant body. As he walked toward the podium surrounded by a roost of 500 SU officers, the entire crowd rose in unison to salute him. It was the one year anniversary of Chowdhury’s rise to absolute power. To honor this occasion, Chowdhury officially proclaimed the birth of a Stuyvesant Empire.</p><p>This proclamation has been a long time coming. Chowdhury’s lust for power was too great for the walls of Stuyvesant to hold. Chowdhury installed swaths of high-ranking SU officers as puppet rulers in all of the other specialized high schools—easily dominating their sheer numbers.</p><p>Chowdhury’s rise began at a time of great strife and internal struggle in Stuyvesant. Rampant corruption and political inertia within the SU led to disastrous mismanagement of a few dances.  The disenchanted student body turned to Chowdhury.</p><p>During his junior year, Chowdhury held rallies in the senior atrium where he gave captivating speeches. His supporters demanded access to the student lounge, and in the process, he organized it.</p><p>As a result of his initial goodwill, Chowdhury was unanimously granted full power, which he used to proclaim himself supreme chancellor. Chowdhury purged the SU of its former members and replaced them with his hundreds of supporters. He formed a secret police monitoring other class cutters and drug users. Social studies teacher Matt Polazzo wholeheartedly agreed with his policies, citing the importance of social contract theory in regulating the unruly Stuyvesant community.</p><p>Order had finally been restored, but Chowdhury knew that he could not maintain support for long with his repressive policies. He knew that for his regime to survive, he would have to expand. Using a staged incident in which a group of Brooklyn Tech students beat up a Stuyvesant freshman as casus belli, Chowdhury declared war on Brooklyn Technical High School. He quickly drafted an army with the entire freshman class and invaded the enemy school.</p><p>The students of Brooklyn Tech were brought back to Stuyvesant to be used as personal servants of the student body. Chowdhury justified his actions to the Stuyvesant community by demonstrating that with the help of servants, they would be able to delegate their work, allowing students to go to sleep on time, pass all their exams, and commit to a hundred extracurricular activities at the same time. Chowdhury then passed a rule forbidding teachers to question their students’ appearances, allowing the slaves to take exams for their masters.</p><p>“What am I doing wrong? Why aren’t my students failing? And why do my students look so different when they come in to take my monster exams?” mathematics teacher Glen Chew said in exasperation.

235	﻿“Going Grey” Pales in Comparison	going-grey-pales-in-comparison	<p>I remember sitting on my bed in 2014, listening to The Front Bottoms’s “Talon of the Hawk,” thinking to my angsty, seventh-grade self that it was one of the best albums ever made. The heaviness of the lyrics, juxtaposed with the upbeat, almost cheerful sound of lead singer Brian Sella’s gritty vocals, was definitely something new to me. Over the years, The Front Bottoms has created a name for itself through exactly that—Sella’s unique voice and plucky acoustic guitar.</p><p>However, these characteristics of the band’s early music are, for the most part, missing from their sixth album, released October 13, 2017. “Going Grey” is the culmination of The Front Bottoms’s 10 years on the music scene, and as the title suggests, Sella and drummer Mathew Uychich are growing up; their hair is turning grey.</p><p>It is their cleanest and most vocally mature album, but at the expense of its original, unique sound. Gone is much of Sella’s boyish, high-pitched voice that many fans were initially attracted to because it was something different from other alternative bands. Instead, the album features more grounded, lower-pitched vocals that no longer distinguish the band from any other band on Spotify’s Indie Rock playlist.</p><p>Tracks like “Trampoline” take the biggest step away from the band’s original sound, integrating synthesizers into the melody. The chorus is almost Daft Punk-esque, but not nearly as well done. Rather, it sounds like two little boys experimenting with electronic music, neither of whom fully know what he is doing. Too often, the work of Auto-Tune is clearly heard, especially on the dragged-out notes of “Grand Finale” and “Far Drive.” Sella’s voice feels restricted as a result of this sonic tweaking, ultimately taking away from these emotion-heavy tracks. In short, the sound is less raw emotion and more toying with electronic pop.</p><p>Content-wise, the songs on “Going Grey” are extremely similar to those of previous works, with focuses on the cyclic joys and woes of relationships, nostalgia, and deep and inconsolable sadness. But none of the lyrics in the 11 songs featured on the album are particularly profound or thought-provoking. From “A temple of daddy” in “Don’t Fill Up On Chips” to “Sometimes when we’re together/We’re not together” in “Trampoline,” the lyrics are not inspiring in any way. Sella is capable of penning meaningful words, as exemplified in the line from the band’s 2013 hit “Twin Size Mattress,” “This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in.../And it should've felt good but I could hear the Jaws theme song on repeat in the back of my mind.” The change in lyrical complexity begs the question: how did we get from there to here?</p><p>However, there are still little nuggets of gold in the album, such as “Bae,” which is not as cringey and terrible as the title suggests. The Front Bottoms flips the idea of a “bae” on its head, instead putting forth the concept that the best relationships are not necessarily the most glamorous. The song is immediately catchy, opening with Uychich’s steady, thumping drum beat. The thrumming guitar in the chorus compels the listener to sing, “I gotta move my car, I gotta move your couch/I learned that love tastes good, you shoved it in my mouth,” with Sella.</p><p>Another noteworthy song is “Raining,” the track most closely resembling their old music, as Sella swaps his newfound mature voice for the raw, imperfect voice that rocketed the New Jersey band to fame in the obscure alternative world. In true Front Bottoms fashion, the exuberant guitar beat and Sella’s cheery crooning of, “How do you think that felt for me” creates a sharp contrast with the gravitas of the subject matter: being released from the hospital but still feeling “all torn up.”</p><p>Sella’s desire for sonic development is certainly admirable, and “Going Grey” is not a total leap to another genre of music. While there are tracks that experiment with new sound, others are reminiscent of the band’s original music. However, for the casual listener who has not listened to the band’s previous albums, what “Going Grey” lacks most is organization. It’s more of a jumbled mess than a coherent, deliberately crafted album. There is no real theme recurring throughout the album, linking the songs together. There is no unity in the album; songs are strung together simply so that there is an order to them rather than to make a statement.</p><p>The Front Bottoms’ sixth album is not unenjoyable, but it doesn’t dazzle. It isn’t as inspiring and heart-wrenching as “Talon of the Hawk,” but it is a commendable attempt at a new direction for the band.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-11-30 09:56:14.339903	16	1	The Front Bottoms’ sixth album, “Going Grey,” swaps out Sella’s raw, idiosyncratic voice and plucky acoustic guitar for vocal maturity and experimentation with a new, electronic sound.
263	﻿Politicizing Tragedy Through Social Media	politicizing-tragedy-through-social-media	<p>At about 3:00 p.m. on Halloween, Sayfullo Saipov drove a pickup truck down a crowded bike path along the West Side Highway, crashed into a school bus on Chambers Street, and got out of his truck with two imitation firearms. In the process, he killed eight people, and seriously injured 11 more. Shortly after the attack, President Trump tweeted, "In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!" How very like our president: he never misses an opportunity to use his Twitter account as a commentary outlet amidst political unrest, as opposed to holding an organized press conference. After a brief acknowledgment of the victims of the shooting, he continued to use Twitter to push his own agenda forward, showing more biased anger in his tweets than sympathy towards the victims and their families.</p><p>In particular, his xenophobic opinions were made clear. There was a stark difference between his reaction to the white Las Vegas shooting earlier this month and the recent attack by a foreigner. When asked if the man that shot and killed 58 people at a concert was a terrorist, Trump declined to answer. He used his infamous stalling tactics and barely brought up the possibility of his administration tightening gun laws in the future.</p><p>But after this attack by an Uzbek national in the name of ISIS, Trump wasted no time in proposing a new approach to immigration to Congress and the public through social media, proclaiming his desire to get rid of the Diversity Visa that brought Saipov into the United States. He tweeted, "CHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!" (Nevermind the fact that Saipov did not come here through chain immigration and that the people he did bring to the U.S. in this manner have not brought any harm to the country.) Trump acknowledged that there are bills going through Congress about ending chain migration, but asserted that they're being "stopped by Democrats because they're obstructionists."</p><p>In also immediately blaming ISIS for the attack, President Trump took advantage of this tragedy to add to partisan divide. The NYPD and the FBI had barely begun their investigation of the crime scene before he tweeted about refusing to let ISIS return to our country. His comments were clearly motivated by his bias against foreigners and Muslims, making this great tragedy no longer about the victims but about finding new ways to discriminate against these groups.</p><p>He also used this event as a jumping-off point to discuss further controversial matters, such as the death penalty and Guantanamo (which he spoke about in subsequent tweets). For instance, he discussed his annoyance with the justice system we have in place because he didn’t think this "animal" deserved to go to court or receive the leniency he would get (since the death penalty is illegal in New York).</p><p>Through social media, President Trump quickly politicized the tragedy that happened on our school's doorstep and incited arguments about immigration and justice, which effectively took attention away from the victims and the survivors. Instead of uniting our country after the attack, he used his platform to divide us on issues loosely related to the offender. Rather than following his lead, we should stand united, regardless of political differences, following such a tragic event.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:09:17.335996	27	1	
267	﻿The Media’s Right to Capture Our Reactions	the-media-s-right-to-capture-our-reactions	<p>What is the media’s main purpose? To inform and share experiences with the public—whether they’re from the United States, South America, or Europe.</p><p>People from around the country and across the world rely on the media to catch up on important events and to get educated on topics, but they can’t do that if they don’t have accurate news from reliable and primary sources.</p><p>The media provides us with the latest news, and without it, many would be lost.</p><p>“If the media wasn’t allowed to ask the students questions, there wouldn’t be a job for reporters. It is their duty to get the freshest information and spread it,” senior Joelle Lum said.</p><p>Especially with the whole spectacle of “fake news,” it’s hard to find out what actually happened on that horrid night. After only an hour had passed since the attack happened, there were already articles claiming that Stuyvesant students had been killed.</p><p>However, while we now know a majority of the immediate articles were either exaggerations or straight-up false, no one knew what was happening at the time, and as people read those articles, they became more fearful. That’s exactly what terrorists want—to instill fear and to interrupt our daily lives.</p><p>Because we don’t want these false headlines spreading, the only way to get authentic news is from the people who actually saw the event unfold. And some of those people happen to be Stuyvesant students.</p><p>In asking students about the event, there is also the possibility of obtaining new facts on the attack. One student may have seen something that the NYPD hasn’t picked up on, and that bit of missing information could perhaps help the ongoing investigation into the sudden attack on Tuesday.</p><p>If students were more open to talk about the event, they would create a less tense and more united environment. When people turn on the news and watch students continuing with their daily routines, it’s empowering, and it shows that the terrorists weren’t able to achieve their goal of instilling fear in the public. A student may have a very different story to share—one that can inspire others to stand up or teach others what to do while there is an attack.</p><p>Students can not only get through to adults but also to the scared younger kids in nearby schools affected by the attack. Students can show them that they are not alone in this and that other people are going through the same thing as they are, which can be super helpful and influential.</p><p>I’m not saying that reporters should continuously hound students who don’t want to be on the news. Obviously, if you are uncomfortable in the presence of cameras and reporters, you have every right to tell them to not film you, and they should respect you and your decision. However, reporters asking students to express their thoughts on Tuesday’s act of terror is not directly an attack on us.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:22:03.9163	27	1	The media has a right to ask students about their experiences during the attack on Tuesday.
268	﻿In Remembrance	in-remembrance	<p>Amidst the excitement of the chilly Halloween afternoon, two friends and I marked the end of our school day by photographing our extravagant costumes. I assumed the role of photographer, laughing at their silly poses while facing away from the West Side Highway.</p><p>Moments later, their wide smiles wilted into looks of sheer terror. I heard a loud crash behind me, and I turned to see body lying atop a crumpled bicycle. As the screams of bystanders sent shivers down my spine, I realized the immediacy of the situation. After finding shelter in a lobby, we sat for what what felt like an eternity under strict lockdown, with the doorman updating the body count every hour.</p><p>It emerged later that we had experienced a confirmed act of terror. Saifullo Sapov, an Uzbek immigrant turned radical, murdered eight innocent civilians after careening a truck down a bike path in Lower Manhattan. This tragedy hit close to home for the Stuyvesant population. Some students witnessed the attack firsthand.</p><p>In the difficult days following, students and administrators have debated how we can properly memorialize the attack. Some claim that commemorating such events would only serve as a constant, physical reminder of the horror we seek to forget.</p><p>However, we cannot deny that there was an attack. If the people most closely affected by this atrocity deem it forgettable by not erecting a monument, there is less motivation to prevent similar attacks in the future. Without attributing a plaque or monument, Stuyvesant sends the message that we’ve stopped discussing what we can never really forget. While the media promotes discourse for several days after the attack, spurring legislators and local authorities to act while fear still lingers, there is less public urgency as the massacre grows less recent. A monument will remind anyone who passes by of the vitality of change at a time where tragic attacks happen, and, if nothing is done, will continue to happen.</p><p>Some members of the Stuyvesant community argue that commissioning a monument would defy our defiant “business as usual” attitude. Marking the landscape impedes the normalcy of life afterwards. But that’s exactly the point: it isn't normal to have such a massive loss of life. It isn’t normal when we know the perpetrator’s life story but not the name of a single victim.</p><p>It’s crucial to call out these events as abnormal for the civilized, compassionate nation we aspire to be. We put up monuments after atrocities not to normalize the pitfalls of humanity, but to recognize the Americans who suffered. Their experiences will be normalized if we disregard this sentiment.</p><p>Therefore, we owe it to the victims of the latest terror attack to memorialize them. Their names and stories should stand out for years, even after the hype and urgency subsides. Moving on as a nation, as a school, and as individuals isn’t equivalent to repressing our memory of the attack.</p><p>The monument shouldn’t overwhelm the landscape (just as this horrific tragedy didn’t overwhelm our school), but it must certainly be present. The profundity of being so near a threat has affected us all. A monument would be a physical manifestation of this mindset: it could’ve been anyone that afternoon, so we must work toward it being no one ever again.</p><p>The following Wednesday after the attack, the hallways were overwhelmed with with students clothed in black. Friends gave each other reassuring hugs; hopeful smiles were flashed on escalators. Classes resumed as usual with remarkably high attendance rates. An otherwise tragic incident brought forth the spirit of our student body as we united for another typical school day.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:23:54.407799	27	1	We put up monuments after atrocities ranging from the Battle of Gettysburg to the Vietnam War to the Oklahoma City Bombing, not to normalize the pitfalls of humanity, but to commend the plight of all the Americans who suffered.
270	﻿Photography in Terrorism: An Exploitation	photography-in-terrorism-an-exploitation	<p>On the evening of Halloween, room 629 was a frustrating scene. My classmates crowded around the leftmost window, squinting their eyes at the only visible sliver of a damaged school bus (I sat back trying to finish my physics homework), when I realized what I had left at home: my camera.</p><p>All I wanted was a single shot of the window. Articles were telling us that two people were dead, which quickly turned into four, then eight, and it was all somewhere close by, outside that window.</p><p>For me, photography has been a way of understanding moments after they happen and of looking at a scene and highlighting the most intimate and meaningful things within it. It’s not always about capturing tragedy, beauty, or people in conflict. What truly matters about a photograph is simply its mood and its message, and it can convey those things in seconds.</p><p>The most recent attack has brought the role of photography in terrorism to the forefront, and it shows us how the media has abused photography’s true purpose. Rather than releasing images that should capture the strength and unity that our city must exhibit, they’ve instead taken photographs that exploit the Stuyvesant student body and the international community. And at its worst, this can only heighten feelings of fear and chaos.</p><p>On the night of the attack, Stuyvesant was surrounded by vans and trucks of several media companies that turned the streets of TriBeCa into photographer-and-reporter galore. As students walked down the moderated path leading towards train stations, many of us noticed the press all around—specifically, the men and women that were trying to take photos of us as we passed. Many of my friends and I covered our faces from the flashbulbs. We did not ask to be photographed, and we did not want to be.</p><p>Even the next day, a photographer had his camera pointed at such an obscure detail as our shoes, recording us all as we walked past him.</p><p>Be it a staff member or student, everyone at Stuyvesant experienced the attack either directly or indirectly, and the feelings that we have about it may be extremely personal. However, when media companies take photos of us without our consent, they bring our own private spheres out into the public. They violate our comfort in a place where we should feel motivated to learn. These are not simply individual headshots of a student or two; they are large-scale depictions of our student body.</p><p>Terrorism is meant to incite fear, but a photograph showing that all Stuyvesant students are frightened and nervous victims does not tell the truth: we are indeed shocked, but not weak.</p><p>The first photograph of Sayfullo Saipov (the Uzbekistani man who committed the attack) was released on the night it happened. His dull mugshot was the icon of nearly every single news channel that night. The most troubling part about this photograph is how little important information it gives us; all we see is the color of his skin and the fact that he has a long, black-haired beard—nothing else.</p><p>I don’t believe that releasing his picture to the general public will benefit anyone. The only purpose of this photograph should have been to help keep his face recorded on a federal level. Past that, it allows us to unconsciously group together a skin color with Islam or a beard with terrorism. The reality, however, is that there is no such facial feature as the “Islamic” kind. Slowly but surely, the photograph of Saipov contributes to sweeping generalizations about millions of Muslim people across the world. At this point, Islamophobia worsens at all costs.</p><p>Consider political activist Laura Loomer, who enraged the twittersphere when she posted pictures of two hijabi women walking on Chambers Street and blamed them for simply being in the area where the attack happened.</p><p>Photographs in the media are full of ideas and messages that we sometimes digest without even an ounce of conscious thought. Nonetheless, they are effective. A photograph should be a positive change in and of itself. But reporters and the media only seem to want to capture the grim and the grit, and this is the seemingly unfixable problem.</p><p>In a week from now, the media might be scrambling to tell another more “important” story. By then, the violent attack on our community will likely just become old news, tangled within a jumble of exploitative photographs, thousands of news articles, and Islamophobic media.</p>	108	5	\N	2017-11-10 22:57:55.149	2017-12-02 06:24:10.519468	27	1	A think-piece about the role media photography has during terrorism—specifically, how it exploited Stuyvesant students’ “private sphere” and serves unjust issues like Islamophobia.
231	﻿“Stranger Things” Brings Tubular Things to Season 2	stranger-things-brings-tubular-things-to-season-2	<p>Suspenseful music cues in as four boys decked out in tan jumpsuits with proton packs stand outside their middle school and stare agape in horror at the scene before them. It is Halloween morning and their day has already gone dramatically awry as more and more kids dressed in casual school clothes pass by. A gut-wrenching realization dawns upon the group as Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) dismayingly utters what they are all thinking: “Why is no one else wearing costumes?”</p><p>This scene is just one of many comical moments from the second season of “Stranger Things.” Iconic for its Eggos, nose-bleeds, and Christmas lights hung above the alphabet painted in black on a wall, the Netflix original series induced a global storm in pop culture ever since its debut over a year ago. Having a distinct nostalgic ‘80s vibe, “Stranger Things” has garnered a massive fan base by attracting old and new generations alike. The second season aired in late October with a whopping 16 million people watching the night of its much-anticipated premiere.</p><p>The story centers around the comradery between four boys, each with their own unique personality. Dustin, who is goofy yet protective, Will (Noah Schnapp), who is soft-spoken and kind, Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), who is pragmatic and serious, and Mike (Finn Wolfhard), who is optimistic and thoughtful, all band together in the pursuit to undertake evil.</p><p>Set in Hawkins, a fictional small town in Indiana where, presumably, nothing ever happens, everything changes one day when Will mysteriously disappears and the other three encounter Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), a girl with bizarre telekinetic powers who escaped the notorious Hawkins lab. Through her, they discover the presence of another dimension, the Upside Down, which is just like their world, but barren, dark, and teeming with Demogorgon monsters. Season one ends on a cliffhanger, with Eleven disappearing after killing the evil Demogorgon and a newly-retrieved, frazzled Will covertly coughing up a infantile Demogorgon, setting up the stage for what is to happen in season two.</p><p>The audience is introduced to a lively new set of characters in the second season. Max (Sadie Sink), a tough, skateboarding, and easily irritable redhead from California joins the boys on their adventures in navigating the mysteries of the Upside Down. Along with her character comes a wild and irredeemable step-brother, Billy (Dacre Montgomery), who poses as the town’s new human antagonist. We then are introduced to a less tangible, but ultimately more dangerous villain, the Shadow Monster—a gargantuan, faceless shadow that roams the Upside Down and threatens the human world with havoc and chaos.</p><p>Besides the introduction of these new characters, the second season differs from the first in that the story unfolds through individual storylines. Though there is less of a sense of comradery than there was in season one, the script delves deeper into each character.</p><p>The season is marked with an abundance of growth from the characters, as opposed to the first season, which mainly introduces the characters and plot. For one, Will, who appears in season one on only a few occasions, has a drastically greater involvement in season two. He becomes the physical link between the two dimensions, causing the other characters to worry endlessly and creating moving scenes as he battles the Shadow Monster’s attempts to possess him.</p><p>Steve Harrington, whose character in season one was merely portrayed as Nancy’s jock of a boyfriend, plays a much larger, more multidimensional role in season two. He is no longer “King Steve,” as known by those in his high school, and he discovers a new role as a guardian of the group—especially Dustin, who he helps not only in defeating multiple Demogorgons, but in navigating teenagehood as well.</p><p>Perhaps the most stunning growth comes from Eleven. In season one, she was portrayed as almost alien-like, always donning a hospital gown or an awkward a blonde wig and a pink dress of a costume. This season, we see her as a teenage girl trying to navigate a world that doesn’t quite accept her. To reconcile with her past, she ventures off to find her mother and her long-lost sister, Kali, whom she was separated from at the lab as a toddler.</p><p>The cinematography proves to be bigger and more ambitious than the previous season. The scenes embody ‘80s nostalgia, shot with a soft lense comparable to the equipment commonly used in ‘80s cinema. The set and costumes not only perfectly embody the nostalgia of ‘80s, but are very specifically mapped out to give us insight into the personality of each character.</p><p>For instance, the political allegiance of each of the boy’s parents during the ‘84 presidential election were shown in the signs on the front lawns of their houses. Mike’s parents, who are wealthier and much removed from his adventurous pursuits, showed allegiance to Reagan, while Dustin’s single, quirky, cat-loving mother showed allegiance to the campaign’s underdog, Mondale.</p><p>More references to that era include homages to classic films. The Shadow Monster was heated out of Will’s body in the fashion of “The Exorcist” (1973), Steve and Dustin walking on railroad tracks resembled a scene from “Stand By Me” (1986), and the group’s halloween costumes were of the squad from “Ghostbusters” (1984), whose theme song played on several occasions. Kali’s gang in the standalone episode was inspired by the gang from “The Warriors” (1979), and Joyce Byers’s (Winona Ryder) dorky boyfriend Bob Newby (Sean Astin) references the ‘X’ on a map as pirate treasure, as Mike Walsh (Sean Astin) does in “The Goonies” (1985).</p><p>The show’s soundtrack also features many songs from the time period such as “Whip It” by Devo and “Time after Time” by Cyndi Lauper. It is unusual yet refreshing to see the world of the ‘80s conveyed with modern special effects and by actors born in the 2000s.</p><p>In only nine hour-long episodes, the second season of “Stranger Things” managed to tie up all of the loose ends left from season one while also telling a story of unlikely allies, complex romances, dealing with grief, and the integrity and purity of a friendship between four boys.</p><p>Though they are growing up to not play as much Dungeons & Dragons, and their battle with the Upside Down grows to a much larger scale than in season one, the story always manages to stay rooted in these lovable characters.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-03 19:43:48.483233	17	1

And of course, lots of coffee helps with that energy boost!</p></p><p><h4>Dawn Vollaro, Math Teacher</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I am really bad about breakfast. I had milk, orange juice, and I had two litte Drake's apple pies. Breakfast is not my thing. This just goes back to when I had to commute to my high school; I just had to throw something down my throat and get out and go on the train, so it has to be fast. And I'm still commuting, to get to Stuyvesant, so it has to be fast. It's not good, but I can't commute on an empty stomach, so it has to be something.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I believe in breakfast. It's not my favorite meal, but if, you know, someone was making me a nice French toast with scrambled eggs, I would like it. I just don't have time for it. I wish I did, but I'm too busy in the morning, so I just eat something, and then I'm out the door.</p></p><p><h4>Marianne Prabhu, Biology Teacher</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>Today, I had a large cup of coffee, with half a Splenda in it, followed by a chocolate-covered Oreo. Most days, I usually have a large cup of coffee, but today, I snuck in the chocolate-covered Oreo.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I probably should have a better breakfast, but I don't. It's just coffee. I would have a two-egg omlette every morning, if I could.</p></p><p><h4>Barbara Garber, Health Teacher</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I have coffee for breakfast and a glass of water. Usually, I have a slice of oatmeal raisin bread with a little almond butter. Sometimes, I have cereal with some kind of low-fat milk. Then, I usually have a piece of fruit around 10 a.m.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>Some people say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. However, there are some people that really can't eat much in the morning. If I have something, I've usually been up for an hour and a half, at the very least. I can't eat first thing when I get up and I can't really eat a big breakfast.</p></p><p><h4>Christine Cabusay, Freshman</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I ate a piece of bread.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>If you're running late, you don't need it.</p></p><p><h4>Lara Somoroff, Freshman</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I had avocado toast.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I don't like to eat too much because it makes me feel heavy. But I still think it's important because I need energy for the day. My sister, for example, doesn't eat anything for breakfast. It's kind of bad. Also, I think it's important to eat healthy.</p></p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-03 20:25:33.178662	3	1	
234	﻿Entertainment is Good but Hollywood’s Rape Culture Isn’t	entertainment-is-good-but-hollywood-s-rape-culture-isn-t	<p>Hollywood’s rape culture is deplorable, and yet, it continues to exist. One of the main sources of the problem is Hollywood’s power complex. Many of the people seeking to break into the industry find themselves at the whims of others with more power in the business. Actress Gwyneth Paltrow, now a household name, had praised Harvey Weinstein in her first Academy Award acceptance speech in 1999, but now condemns him for his sexually abusive acts. After her first distasteful confrontation with the former producer, Paltrow said she kept quiet out of concern that she would lose her starring role in “Emma” (1996), and over the years, she had tried to ignore Weinstein’s alternating kind and bullying personality.</p><p>Within Hollywood’s atmosphere, monetary pressure and an unstable career can silence those who suffer. An investigation by The New York Times found that Weinstein has been paying off accusers for at least two decades in the three that he’s been known to have committed sex crimes.</p><p>One of the better known cases of this is with actress turned activist Rose McGowan, who had been assaulted by Weinstein at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. After McGowan made hints about making her allegations public, Weinstein’s close associate reached out to her with an offer of $1 million in exchange for signing a nondisclosure statement. With money and high esteem, Weinstein could easily boost careers and often did so after forcing aspiring young women to unwillingly succumb to his sexual acts.</p><p>The co-founder of the Weinstein Company isn’t the only sex offender who has been able to get away from the attention of the public eye for so long. In another recent series of allegations, “House of Cards”  star Kevin Spacey was accused of trying to seduce actor Anthony Rapp when Rapp was only 14 years old. Since then, at least a dozen others have joined Rapp in accusing Spacey, including former Boston TV news anchor Heather Unruh, who spoke of Spacey getting her son drunk before proceeding to grab the then 18-year-old’s genitals. In a Twitter response to the allegations against him, Spacey admitted to having sexually assaulted Rapp and came out as gay soon after.</p><p>Media outlets blew up, but rather than focusing on Spacey’s admission of sexual assault, they focused almost exclusively on the actor’s coming-out. Only when the public criticized the lack of attention on Spacey’s illegal actions did the media stop covering up the accusations. The media follows Hollywood’s lead and tries to make revenue through enticing topics like sexual orientation rather than heavy ones like sexual abuse. Comedian Cameron Esposito says it best in her reaction to Spacey’s tweet, “Being gay has nothing to do w[ith] going after underage folks.”</p><p>The media’s reluctance to address the real problems is a common issue. When an unpleasant subject matter is being covered, news sources will often still downplay the magnitude of the situation, as with the news coverage of Spacey’s tweets.</p><p>Though Hollywood promotes liberal messages, its rape culture is still prevalent. The scandals and sexual crimes that continue to pop up in the news are directly correlated to Hollywood’s biased nature and inability to confront its own problems.</p><p>The quietness of victims further enables sexual harassment. Of the more than 80-something women who have spoken out against Weinstein, only a handful have chosen to relay more information either themselves or through representatives. However, actress Scarlett Johansson defends those who are silent, saying, “It’s irresponsible to take a bunch of actors [...] and throw their name into a situation they couldn’t possibly comment on.” The people who refuse to or cannot speak are not to blame. Those who choose to take action can be putting their careers in jeopardy or may even face the failure of not being heard.</p><p>What may be contributing to victims’ inaction is the inaction of the community around them. Commenting on the rumors about Weinstein raping McGowan, actor Alec Baldwin said to Entertainment Weekly, “It was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.”</p><p>At times in his interview, Baldwin certainly sounded like the man he impersonates on “Saturday Night Live.” Though he extended his sympathies, Baldwin made himself complicit by victim blaming. It almost seemed as if Baldwin was trying to provide cover for the assaulters, or had tried to remain neutral for the sake of reputation.</p><p>In his interview, Baldwin implied that he wouldn’t want to risk his job just to help someone in need, and in a later tweet, he called the sexual assaults a matter of gender inequality. Despite his words of empowerment, Baldwin’s excuses for his inaction completely revoke his sympathetic gestures. These types of excuses are rampant in Hollywood circles and make many unknowing bystanders.</p><p>Hollywood’s efforts to be liberal are inconsistent since many of its actions directly counteract feminist messages. Few harassers are punished severely, and accusers often aren’t taken seriously or even believed. It’s increasingly problematic when also considering that actresses get asked questions about sexual assault more often than actors, including those who have responded to allegations. This proves the public’s difficulty focusing on the bigger picture: that both men and women are victims of sexual harassment and have the responsibility to act accordingly toward our problematic rape culture.</p><p>Each new allegation that arises doesn’t badly affect the industry, which is churning out more movies than ever. This year has had quite the movie lineup, with films such as the long-awaited revival of “It” (2017) and the recent releases “Thor: Ragnarok” (2017) and “Justice League” (2017).</p><p>Hollywood has set the standards for filmmaking and is revered around the world. However, in the social sphere, it needs to start taking initiative, even if that means having its best people marginalized. Many of Hollywood’s celebrities have been outed for their crimes, but have faced minor consequences and continue to do well in their professions. People need to get past the facade that actors and studio-goers put up and start prosecuting these criminals for hurting countless women and men. Like it does for its films, the American movie industry must also set the standards for how it treats sexual assailants.</p>	108	6	\N	2017-12-01 22:57:55.149	2017-12-17 14:45:49.905171	28	1	In the highly-pressurized environment of Hollywood, rape culture continues to exist and little is being done about it.
413	﻿Pool Freezes Over and Traps Several Freshmen	pool-freezes-over-and-traps-several-freshmen	<p>The pool froze over following a stressful week of blizzards and several mishaps with a recent chemistry lab involving liquid nitrogen, trapping several freshmen in swim gym.</p><p>Teachers have responded with outrage, demanding that an emergency rescue squad be sent in to recover the frozen bodies. One anonymous teacher was even willing to violate department rules and offer the frozen freshmen make-up tests once rescued. Though the rescue team was armed with ice picks, chainsaws, and an industrial-grade jackhammer, the rescuers’ efforts only managed to create an inch-deep crack in the pool.</p><p>After seeing their failed attempts, the biology faculty members decided to take matters into their own hands by pouring out their scalding hot mugs of coffee onto the ice. With the combined forces of the rescue squad and about 16 propane tanks’ worth of coffee, a single pair of moldy swim trunks jammed in the water filter was successfully freed from the ice.</p><p>The subsequent shortage of coffee put the teachers in a terrible mood for the rest of the day; extensive examinations on the effects of caffeine withdrawal on the human body were given.</p><p>Sophomore Steve Wang took this opportunity to improve his floor hockey skills for gym class. “This ice is perfect for practice,” Wang declared. “It’s exactly the same hardness as the gym floor, so I get to go through the same experience of falling on my face as I do in gym, except with even more numbing pain from the cold!”</p><p>While the pool remains frozen at the time of this article’s publication, another rescue attempt is projected to take place in early February. Now armed with the school’s supply of Bunsen burners, the team expects their next rescue to be a successful one. Until then, the freshmen are expected to survive off dank memes viewed through a giant projector above the pool.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:57:42.154183	2018-01-23 02:57:42.262926	5	1	After a series of unfortunate events, the pool froze over, inciting mixed reactions from teachers and students.

Stuy strong!” the Spartans shouted before starting their season on December 5 against Edward R. Murrow High School. The team fell 42-47 in the season opener, but there were many positive takeaways. “I saw some good wrestling from these beginners. This is an early tourney in the season, so obviously, I saw some mistakes as well. Me and the other captain, [senior] Adam Abbas, helped these guys grow as wrestlers, so it was real nice to see them perform well,” senior and co-captain Allard Peng said. Though senior Danil Chernov and junior Rubin Peci both joined this season, both came away with victories in the match. They will play big roles this season as the team tries to rise up in its Region 5 division.</p><p>Despite the many positives, Peng was disappointed with his own performance, saying, “I ended up taking third out of a bracket of six people. I feel like I didn't wrestle smart, and I didn't uphold my role as a role model.” These high standards will ideally translate into improvement as the season continues, as Peng’s drive for success will hopefully carry over to the team. Overall, this first match was a great starting point for the Spartans.</p><p>The team wants to bounce back from their 2-5 record from last year. They want to improve in hopes of getting to the playoffs. This will be tough without Cade Lueker (‘17), who finished second at the City Championships last year in the 170-pound weight class. In order to minimize the effect of his loss, Peng and Abbas are taking initiatives to train the younger people on the team. Specifically, “[We have] to stay focused and stick to the basics. In wrestling, what wins a match are the simple and practiced moves,” Abbas said. Repeating the same sets of moves over and over will drill them into the team, which will hopefully translate into in-game success.</p><p>Pushing each other both at practices and competitions can create the drive that can lead this team to where they want to be. A long-term goal, Peng said, “[is] to see Stuyvesant High School produce a State Champion.” It remains to be seen whether this season will produce one, but, one match in, the Spartans have their work cut out for them.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:03:52.492875	24	1	The Stuyvesant wrestling team showed a lot of potential in their season opener against Edward R.

319	﻿Peglegs Looking to Capture Fourth Straight Title	peglegs-looking-to-capture-fourth-straight-title	<p>There has never been a dark spot in the history of Stuyvesant’s boys’ table tennis team, the Titans. Ever since table tennis became an official PSAL sport three years ago, in 2014, the boys’ table tennis team has dominated the city and captured all three championships.</p><p>During last year’s playoffs, first-seeded Stuyvesant faced its rival, Brooklyn Technical High School, and won the match 5-0. The team easily won each of its games 3-0 (in a best of five). Though the team has lost five seniors, including first and second singles Alston Wang and Eric Amstislavskiy, respectively, it still hopes to continue its golden streak. Current senior and co-captain Isaac Rose-Berman said, “We've never lost a game in [the last] four years and [we] want to keep that streak going, especially as this is [Dr. Feigenbaum’s] final year. We definitely want to make him proud and perform to the best of our ability.”</p><p>Many of last year’s players, along with a mixture of new players, have had to step into a larger role this year. Senior and co-captain Alvin Chen, who became first singles this year, said, “We are definitely going to have a much harder time without last year's seniors, but I believe if everyone does his part, we can win again.”</p><p>Currently, the team is in first place in the Central Division. In the past three games, the Titans have shut out Brooklyn Community Arts and Media (BCAM) High School, Millennium High School, and Jacqueline K. Onassis Inter Careers all by a score of 5-0, not losing a single game in the BCAM match. New starters this year include sophomore Jeremy Lee as first doubles and senior Mahidul Shahel with freshman Dilan Apterman as second doubles.</p><p>One notable thing is that while they are still winning, the Titans seem to be struggling more than they have in the past. In the previous game against Millennium High School, the third singles game played by Rose-Berman and the first doubles match, played by Lee and junior substitute Linpeng Chen, were won by 3-1, meaning they each dropped a game to their opponents. While they both handily won their matches, it could become a more pronounced problem against a tougher team.</p><p>That tougher team is also their main rival, Brooklyn Tech. “It’s an uphill battle for us. A few people have to improve to have a shot at [defeating] Brooklyn Tech,” coach Feigenbaum said. He made it clear that this season is going to be much tougher than those of previous years because of the loss of key players and the new freshmen that Brooklyn Tech has acquired. However, as of right now, the team appears to be as strong as ever.</p><p>Since this could be coach Feigenbaum’s last year, he has to prepare his players for a coaching change and find the new coach. He does not believe that the assistant coach will step into that role and has been “looking for people that…know the rules and the strategy and have the time to do the job.” While it is still early in the season, it is never too early to think about the future.</p><p>The Titans are gearing up for another championship run despite the loss of multiple seniors from last year. They have shown a few signs of weakness compared to last year, meaning everyone has to step and work a little harder. Many of the players have had a lot of experience with table tennis and been part of the championship teams led by Dr. Feigenbaum and will again aim for a fourth straight City Championship.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:04:24.861601	24	1	The Stuyvesant boys’ table tennis team, the Titans, are looking to capture their fourth straight title amid the loss of key players.

It's a bike that allows you to ride long distances, and you use it to travel long distances. It was a long time ago. I think maybe my mother bought it for me.”</p><p><h4>Carlos Bravo (Spanish Teacher)</h4></p><p>“When I was about eight years old, my grandmother gave me a baked potato wrapped in tinfoil. I cried for two hours.”</p><p><h4>Kristyn Pluchino (Chemistry Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The weirdest gift I got from a student is makeup. I don't really wear much makeup, but they got me foundation. I've gotten a lot of other terrible gifts. In the ‘80s, my mom got me a little business suit, and I was a child with a blazer and gigantic shoulder pads.”</p><p><h4>Jason Econome (Biology Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift for me would have to be the birth of my son, a month before Christmas. George was eight pounds and quite beautiful. It was a great way to bring in the Christmas holiday. and it couldn’t be any better than that. The worst gift is probably clothing. I was a hyperactive kid; all I had on my mind was sports and music. I was actually thinking I was going to get a bicycle; I just needed one badly. Instead I got clothing: a pair of pants and a couple of shirts; what a disappointment!"</p><p><h4>Charles Kuang (Computer Science Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The weirdest gift I ever received was from this student I taught in middle school, but also teach now. She gave me a dictionary because I misspelled the word ‘class’ on the board like one time.”</p><p><h4>Marianne Prabhu (Biology Teacher)</h4></p><p>“That's tough, because for the most part, people are pretty good gift-givers. My mom is an excellent gift-giver; she's always so thoughtful. But I would have to say, one of the worst gifts was that a guy I was dating got me a gift card to a teacher's store. I was like, 'This isn't something fun; that isn't a personal gift!'"</p><p><h4>Ernest Oliveri (Assistant Principal of the World Languages Department)</h4></p><p>“I think I got a weird kitchen utensil once. It was one of those multi-tool kitchen utensils that don't work very well. I've also given some pretty weird gifts; I gave my wife a weed-whacker—not the kind of gift you give a woman. When we bought a house, I couldn't touch the lawn mower—she wouldn't let me go near it. I thought to myself, ‘She has discovered her inner gardener; I'm going to get her something that she can use in the garden.’ So I got her a weed-whacker. To this day, she has not touched that weed-whacker. And she did not talk to me for about three days.”</p><p><h4>Katherine Kincaid (English Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift that I've ever received was when I had first met my husband, we had first started dating, so he did my birthday gifts as a scavenger hunt. He hid the presents all over my apartment, and each present had a clue to finding the next present, and they got slowly better. They were all different things that I wanted, like a book or a nice shirt, and some of them were more sentimental things. The present that I liked the most was a little card that said he would take me out shopping to buy whatever outfit of my choice in whatever store I wanted.”</p><p><h4>Madeline Horan (English Teacher)</h4></p><p>“I'd say the weirdest holiday gift came from my grandmother, a devout Catholic who went to mass every day, which showed in her Christmas presents—usually holy cards, rosary beads, and prayer books. When I was thirteen, she gave me a statue of the Virgin Mary wrapped up in newspaper. I unraveled it to find a painted face smiling at me, but then I lost sight of the eyes as the head rolled out of the newspaper. She told me, ‘I dropped it in the St. Scholastica parking lot.’ I wasn't sure whether we should put it on the mantle.”</p><p><h4>Eric Ferencz (English Teacher)</h4></p><p>"As a Jewish child in a Christian country, I came to learn Hanukkah exists amidst the deeply-cast shadow of Christmas. It's a completely unfair comparison. Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Christ, a seminal holiday. Hanukkah is a minor Jewish holiday; a celebration of a successful Maccabean revolution, an event that cannot be found in the pages of the Old Testament. Hanukkah is not our Christmas. Considering this disparity, Hanukkah's proximity to Christmas on the calendar, and the gross commercialization of holiday gift-giving, Hanukkah is unfairly presented as the Jewish counterpart of Christmas.</p><p>In my family, Hanukkah was a progressive holiday: over the course of eight days, the gifts became progressively worse. The first night was always reserved for the best presents; a copy of Contra for the NES [Nintendo Entertainment System], or a new CD player. But as the seventh or eighth night rolled around, and parental creativity waned, gifts became more utilitarian as I'd received objects that I simply expected my parents to purchase for me. One could imagine the disappointed look on an eight-year-old tearing eagerly through decorative wrapping paper only to discover tube socks? Pencils? A new toothbrush? And as Jewish holidays begin when the sun sets, the anticipation of that night's gifts paired with some unrealistic daydreaming could only lead to disappointment when unwrapping the gifts of night four or five or six or seven or eight.</p><p>I know that I'm speaking of a child of great privilege, but at the time, considering the fortunes I perceived my peers had bestowed upon them, I somehow felt jilted."</p><p><h4>Liliya Shamazov (Music Teacher)</h4></p><p>“Mrs. Hall and I got a card picture of both of us. The kids went out to Central Park where people paint you, but in a caricature style. They had this guy paint us based on our photographs, and they brought it in, and it was really adorable and funny.”</p><p><h4>Lee Brando (Social Studies Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift that I've ever received is not anything material. It would be having my family members around: the people that I love, the people that are close to me. I'm thankful for the birth of all my nieces and my nephew, that my family is healthy, and my friends are healthy as well. And for my health. And also my students. That's the best gift I can think of; everything else is ephemeral. We do have lives, but in terms of total fulfillment, it's people.”</p><p><h4>Rebecca Lindemulder (French and German Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift I got was an iPhone a couple years ago, but it had hidden motives because my parents wanted me to stay in contact with them when I was away from them.”</p><p><h4>Maria Nedwidek-Moore (Biology Teacher)</h4></p><p>“I still have most gifts and cards I have ever received in my life, and Christmas is far and away my favorite holiday. Gift-giving is a precious thing, and I never want to forget when I am privileged to receive a gift from someone. I first thought of a Christmas gift from my parents that changed the way I think about the world. It was a small toy microscope, which I still have, and I was mesmerized, eventually pursuing biology as a career.</p><p>My father often took me to Tiffany's to look at the engagement rings when I got older. Eventually, I met my husband. Six months after the day I met him at my 25th Stuy reunion, he proposed. We went the next day for the ring, walking across Central Park to Tiffany's in the spring rain. I was excited to find something practical and pretty, and just what we could afford. We were married in August of 2014. That ring definitely qualifies as the best gift: something I wished for all my life, from the man I wished for all my life.”</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:26:28.446782	3	1	
321	﻿What Happens Online Doesn’t Stay Online	what-happens-online-doesn-t-stay-online	<p>This past year has seen an unprecedented number of cases of online harassment, cyberbullying, and intentional acts of hate in the Stuyvesant community. A group of freshman boys was found to have been ranking and commenting on their their female classmates’ appearances in a derogatory fashion. Screenshots of the messages, which were exchanged in a private group chat, were posted in the freshman Facebook group. The boys in question offered apologies only once they found the majority of the freshman class objected to their actions. Yet the issue did not and does not end there.</p><p>The effects of such a toxic conversation aren’t ended with a half-hearted apology. One of the girls they targeted cut class in order to avoid seeing them. The term “respecting women” has become the mocking mantra of a select group of students who believe what the boys did was an extension of their right to free speech. Arguments over Facebook have seeped into the daily lives of Stuyvesant students, adding a degree of undeniable severity. When incidents like this occur, students and the administration must take on certain responsibilities in order to address these issues effectively.</p><p><b>Responsibilities of Students</b></p><p>In the freshman Facebook group, being able to chime in on an issue online led to a massive influx of posts and hundreds of comments written by freshmen, chastising their peers. The comments began as condemnations of objectifying women and ended with personal attacks against the students in question. It got to the point where Student Union President Tahseen Chowdhury felt the need to block any new posts, writing, “All posts are moderated until the group is cleaned up and everyone learns their limits.”</p><p>There is a clear line between informing someone of inappropriate behavior online and constructively criticizing his or her actions. Students online must understand that name-calling and threatening someone for his or her beliefs is indistinguishable from harassment and cyberbullying. Once the provoking issue has been identified and the person approached and talked to maturely, students must learn to take a step back.</p><p>Students must also realize that everything they post online is their direct responsibility. Whether a message is posted in a public Facebook group or messaged in a private group chat, students run and must accept the risk of it being viewed by anyone. When other students have the opportunity to screenshot offensive or harmful posts, privacy and immunity from repercussions are not guaranteed, especially when these posts directly affect Stuyvesant students. In addition, witnessing cyberbullying warrants reporting it.</p><p>When incidents such as these occur, the first group to approach handling it should be the student body. This means expanding the role of Big Sibs and other upperclassmen to serve as unofficial mediators. Underclassmen who feel more comfortable talking to their fellow students instead of immediately going to their guidance counselors should be able to trust the upperclassmen, who in turn must be mature and responsible in handling it to their best of their abilities. When they feel the issue is a delicate one that requires adult intervention, Big Sibs must take the initiative to bring it up to the administration.</p><p><b>Responsibilities of the Administration</b></p><p>When a student has been targeted, the administration has the responsibility to offer the victim ways to cope with and resolve the event. The victim should be called to his or her guidance counselor’s office immediately after the administration hears of the incident. A guidance counselor should offer emotional support and ask to provide any services to the student, such as an appointment with the SPARK office. If the student would not like to discuss the event with an adult, the guidance counselor should not interrogate the student or force him or her to discuss the event. In this case, the guidance counselor can gently recommend the student talks to a Big Sib.</p><p>Further, the student who has been targeted should have a say in how the conflict between the harasser and the victim should be resolved. If the victim asks for it, he or she should have a chance to talk with the harasser and explain why these actions were hurtful. A guidance counselor should be present to mediate the conversation and make sure the situation does not escalate, but the counselor should not attempt to control the dialogue. Both students should be able to explain their sides of the conflict in a constructive way. The mediation session should end when the victim decides it should, and if the victim would like more than one session, their request should be granted.</p><p>We understand that students may not be able to appropriately rationalize their experiences with bullying and ask for help when they need it. However, guidance counselors must make sure that when a student does ask for their help, the situation is not taken out of that student’s hands. If a student only wants to talk about a traumatic event but would rather not attend a mediation session, guidance should not force him or her to discuss the event with the harasser.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-21 23:34:20.90978	8	1

Over the course of 12 hours, 250 middle school and high school students from New York gathered on the first three floors to brainstorm coding projects and to execute them.</p><p>Once all of the projects were submitted, they were judged by a panel of computer scientists, and the winning projects were awarded prizes, such as Amazon Echo Dots or Virtual Reality (VR) Headsets.</p><p>Stuyvesant alumni, seniors taking advanced computer science classes, and three experienced volunteers from Upperline School of Code, a gold sponsor of StuyHacks, helped the participants with their coding.</p><p>“This is probably some people’s very first time experiencing full-on coding, and for others it’s more just practice and trying to come up with new ideas,” said sophomore Ahmed Sultan, who was a member of the group that won first place.

328	﻿Stuy’s Take on the 2018 Grammys	stuy-s-take-on-the-2018-grammys	<p>Held in New York’s very own Madison Square Garden, the 2018 Grammys come at a time when the lines between politics, art, and advocacy are more blurred than ever. The annual Grammy awards not only provide a platform for artists from all genres to share their music with millions across the country, but often reflect the social and political issues at the forefront of the national zeitgeist. Both a competition between the country’s preeminent musicians and a celebration of music as both art and activism, The Grammys conclude the previous year and set the tone for the coming year in music. While music may not be emphasized at Stuy, it is an integral part of many students’ lives and perspectives. Below are analyses of major Grammy categories, identifying and breaking down major trends, likely winners, and what the nominees say about the state of the genre.</p><p><center>Air Date: Sunday, January 28, 2018<br>Time: 7:30PM - 11PM<br>Network: CBS</center></p><p><b>Record of the Year: Hip-Hop Strikes Back,</b> by Miranda Lepri and Jevina Wong</p><p><i>Who to root for: “HUMBLE.”</i></p><p>Rap and hip-hop have historically never been favored for Record of the Year, but the diverse nominees heading into the 2018 Grammys promise to set this year apart from its predecessors. No matter the outcome, these Grammys have already succeeded in resisting the status quo.</p><p>One of the top honors of the night is awarded to the Artist and producers of a single record. The category is stacked with juggernauts like Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” featuring Justin Bieber. As a Spanish-language hit, it is significant that the Grammys are acknowledging the track in such a major category.</p><p>This is the first time the list has been dominated by R&B and hip-hop, a refreshing and exciting change from such a pop-heavy category. Though a nod should be given to Bruno Mars’s “24K Magic,” Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.,” off of his profound and honest album “DAMN.,” cannot be ignored and is a shoo in for the honor—especially considering the 58th Grammys, when many criticized the way “To Pimp a Butterfly” was passed over in favor of Taylor Swift’s “1989” for Album of the Year. “HUMBLE.” brings to the table both the social relevance in its discussion of rap culture and objectification of women and widespread popularity, making it a favorite for the award.</p><p>Nominated too is Jay Z’s “The Story of O.J.,” a cutting and potent commentary on the injustice and dehumanization facing the black community as a whole regardless of individual differences, giving him a total of eight nominations. Capping the list is Childish Gambino’s “Redbone,” featuring a mellow beat and unique soulful twang, a clear contrast to its dancey upbeat peers.</p><p><b>Album of the Year: Art as Activism, </b>by Shray Tripathi</p><p><i>Who to root for: “DAMN.”</i></p><p>Among the iconic lyrics and groovy tunes that define 2017 are notes of musical, political, and social change. These distinguish the five nominees for the upcoming Album of the Year award: "Melodrama" by Lorde, "4:44" by rapper Jay Z, "DAMN." by Kendrick Lamar, "Awaken, My Love!" by rapper Childish Gambino, and "24K Magic” by Bruno Mars.</p><p>Jay Z, Childish Gambino, and Kendrick Lamar share roots in rap, but each of their albums use the medium differently, with songs that are smooth and jazzy or intense and awakening. Bruno Mars is the romantic standout, and songs in “24K Magic” expand and diverge from his characteristically funky, post-disco style. The nominated albums are extremely diverse musical explorations, and a win for any of them could inspire unique change for the music industry altogether.</p><p>Lorde’s name is, among the crew, fresh but not unheard: she is the same star that swept the music industry at age 16 when her hit song “Royals” won a Grammy award in 2014. But this time, she’s four years older, and “Melodrama” shines with her fuller experiences of love, social situations, and young adulthood.</p><p>A win for Lorde would be extremely similar to Adele’s win last year for the painful album “25,” which (to popular dismay) beat out Beyoncé’s profound “Lemonade.” This year, Lamar’s “DAMN.” might be in the same position. His album expresses themes of racism and black identity and even calls out FOX News’s Geraldo Rivera in “YAH.” The Academy’s tendency to lean away from art that explicitly addresses race and identity might not do justice to his art, but this should not lessen its importance.</p><p>No matter who ends up holding the trophy, all of these artists have zeal and meaningful messages to share.</p><p><b>Song of the Year: Pop Surrenders Its Throne,</b> by Tiffany Chen</p><p><i>Who to root for: 4:44</i></p><p>This year’s nominations for Song of the Year are catchy and soulful, ranging from Luis Fonsi’s and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito” to Bruno Mars’ “That’s What I Like.” Though this songwriter's award traditionally goes to pop hits like Adele’s “Hello” and Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud,” it’s refreshing to see an R&B nomination, Bruno Mars’s “That’s What I Like” on the list of nominees, showing the growing prevalence of R&B in popular music. Also much beloved by critics is Jay-Z’s “4:44,” a thought-provoking, raw, and masterfully produced ode to his relationship with Beyoncé following her critically acclaimed 2016 album Lemonade. Both albums have gained meaning since Jay-Z confessed to cheating on Beyoncé in an interview with The New York Times.</p><p>Also nominated is the woke “1-800-273-8255” co-written by Logic and Alessia Cara, among others. While the recording academy hasn’t favored the rap genre or songs that bring up difficult and often dark themes like “1-800-273-8255,” the song’s candid message of hope and redemption may redeem it in the Academy’s eyes as well.</p><p>Perhaps not on par with the rest of the field is Julia Michaels’s “Issues.” Similar to the nomination of Mike Posner's “I Took a Pill in Ibiza” last year, “Issues” is an emotional, beautiful song, but comparatively less powerful than the other nominations.</p><p><b>Best New Artist: Surprises Aren’t So Surprising, </b> by Emma Linderman</p><p><i>Who to root for: SZA</i></p><p>With such a wide variety of genres making up the 2018 nominees, it’s difficult to predict which artist will take home the award. The 2018 nominees are made up of artists SZA, Alessia Cara, Lil Uzi Vert, Khalid, and Julia Michaels. After “Ctrl,” her debut album, garnered widespread attention, R&B singer SZA stands out as this year’s most nominated woman. A New Jersey Native, SZA’s soaring voice and plaintive, often painful themes of love, acceptance, and coming of age, have made her a favorite of many R&B fans.</p><p>Also popular is Canadian pop vocalist Alessia Cara. Nominated for three other Grammys including Song of the Year with Logic for “1-800-273-8255,” Cara is not the only nominee with a notable past; R&B/pop artist Khalid has already been named “Best New Artist” at this year’s MTV music awards.</p><p>Up for an award shown to be inclusive to rap musicians (Chance the Rapper took home the award last year), Lil Uzi Vert stands out as having created music that incorporates elements from several genres, including rock, rap, and emo. In a category that is known for surprises, from jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding taking home the Grammy over Justin Bieber in 2011 to current legends like Lauryn Hill and Mariah Carey winning the title at the outset of their careers, it is almost impossible for any nominee to be ruled out or ensured a win.</p><p><b>Best Pop Solo Performance: Less is More, </b>by Andrew Ng</p><p><i>Who to root for: “Shape of You”</i></p><p>The nominees for best Pop Solo Performance this year range from overplayed summer hits to newer pop gems. The stand out song amidst the nominees is “Shape of You” by Ed Sheeran. An upbeat, party song with an immediately catchy tune which topped the Billboard Hot 100, a feat none of the other nominees managed to accomplish.</p><p>With the nominations of “Praying” by Kesha and “Million Reasons” by Lady Gaga, the Recording Academy seems to have taken a liking to stripped down pop ballads that have recently gained massive popularity. Kesha’s vocals are not hidden behind overproduction as she belts with strong emotions about moving forward and forgiveness. Gaga similarly approached “Million Reasons” with the same idea: less production is more.</p><p>Other nominees include “What About Us,” a run-of-the-mill P!nk song and “Love So Soft” by Kelly Clarkson, an upbeat, R&B-influenced pop song which is far and away the funnest song of the five with its swanky, fast-paced beat.</p><p>Overall, the song most likely to take the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance is “Shape of You” because of its mass appeal, but “Million Reasons” by Lady Gaga and “What About Us” by P!nk also are strong contenders.</p><p><b>Best Urban Contemporary Album: No One’s in “Ctrl”, </b>by Cheyanne K. I. Lawrence</p><p><i>Who to root for: All of them</i></p><p>This year’s Grammy nominations for Best Urban Contemporary Album are arguably the best albums of 2017, all pitted against each other. 6LACK’s debut, “Free,” is a moody, lyrical masterpiece that fuses emotional R&B with trap beats. SZA’s “CTRL” is a lively R&B album with standout hip-hop influences dealing with themes of love, sex, individuality, and navigating adolescence. In the same vein, Khalid’s “American Teen” is an upbeat chronicle of youth, with love songs like “Young, Dumb and Broke” that took mainstream radio by storm.</p><p>Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” is stylistically the most creative Album of 2017 with the hit song “Redbone” that dominated the charts for months. The sound of this album is almost impossible to pinpoint. The Weeknd’s “Starboy” is simultaneously gloomy and cheery but always poetic. He displays strong hip-hop influences and plenty of rap features as well as vocal growth since his album “Beauty Behind the Madness” which won the category in 2015; his vocal deliverance is more advanced than any of his previous albums.</p><p>Present among all the albums are distinctive sounds, masterful production, and influences from genres ranging from alternative to hip-hop. Urban Contemporary was a category created in 2013 by the Recording Academy as a space for Black artists that don’t quite fall into rap or R&B. By definition, the albums cannot confined to a single genre and the category continues to provide a platform for innovative Black artists to help their music reach a larger audience.</p><p>All of the albums nominated have very distinct sounds and are the products of some of the most talented Contemporary Urban artists to date. Predicting a winner is almost impossible.</p><p><b>Best Rock Song: Calm Before the Storm, </b>by Thomas Chen</p><p><i>Who to root for: “Run”</i></p><p>Though rock music may not be as relevant as it once was decades ago, which is evident through the notable lack of rock nominees for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist, this year’s contenders for the Best Rock Song are still as competitive as ever.</p><p>The 2018 nominations for the Grammy are Metallica’s “Atlas, Rise,” K.Flay’s “Blood in the Cut,” Nothing More’s “Go to War,” the Foo Fighters’ “Run,” and Avenged Sevenfold’s “The Stage.” Of these nominees, Nothing More’s “Go to War” and the Foo Fighters’ “Run” are the strongest contenders for the Grammy. “Go to War” is Nothing More’s first Grammy nomination, but it’s clear that it is one well-deserved—alternating between gentle, softer singing and dynamic, passionate belting at a constant, fast-paced tempo, complemented by bass riffs; “Go to War” is nothing but raw and intense.</p><p>Similarly, the Foo Fighters’ “Run” juxtaposes Dave Grohl’s slightly melancholic, inspiring singing with a frenzy of guitar, drums, and screaming, ultimately creating a genuinely energetic, compelling piece. “Run”’s vaguely political themes and heavy sound differentiate it from the Foo Fighters’ past music and help it stand out from the rest of the crowd. However, K.Flay’s “Blood in the Cut” (interestingly, the only female solo rock act to have earned a nomination this year) certainly is not one to be ignored, with Flay’s moody voice gradually growing more furious with the louder drumming and guitar.</p><p><b>Best Rap Song: Old School vs. New Wave, </b> by Carter Ley</p><p><i>Who to root for: “The Story of O.J.”</i></p><p>This year’s Grammy nominations for Best Rap Song, a songwriter award, feature a few standout hits including Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar’s sweeping and pointed critique of beauty standards and hip-hop stereotypes in “HUMBLE.” (from his recent album, “DAMN.”) and Cardi B’s fiery single that reached near ubiquity this fall, “Bodak Yellow.” While nominated in the same category, these songs represent a growing rift in rap between old school lyricism and a new wave of catchy, yet shallower content.</p><p>While not quite as radio-friendly, Jay-Z’s “The Story of O.J.” is equally powerful. Like the rest of his songs in his recent “4:44,” “The Story of O.J.” touches upon a variety of controversial topics and racial stereotypes as he features numerous pop culture references and frequently responds to his wife Beyoncé’s recent album “Lemonade.”</p><p>Alongside these popular hits is North Carolina rapper Rapsody’s “Sassy” from her latest album, “Laila’s Wisdom.” You may remember her from a feature on Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly” in 2015. Finally, Danger Mouse was nominated for his “Chase Me” from the recent film, “Baby Driver” (2017). This year’s Grammy nominations are particularly interesting for rap fans as it is the first year that two individual female artists are nominated for Best Rap Song, which many consider to be an important milestone in the ever-expanding female rap genre. Most critics predict that Kendrick Lamar will win this category with “HUMBLE.” because of its innovative style and controversial social commentary; however, it is possible that Jay-Z’s candidness and heavy-hitting lyricism will push “The Story of O.J.” to victory.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 16:52:00.36416	4	1	
331	﻿The Democratic Party is the Women's’ Party	the-democratic-party-is-the-women-s-party	<p>As the recent #MeToo movement gains traction, people have been shocked at the sheer multitude and severity of sexual harassment stories that women have to share. There are high-profile cases of sexual assault allegations across a number of industries, including film, journalism, and politics. And though individuals of all political backgrounds have been accused of sexual assault, the Democratic Party is the one acknowledging the issue and speaking out against it. Democrats have been vocal against sexual assault, something that has always been characteristic of their party.</p><p>Harvey Weinstein, one of the most infamous subjects in the recent discussion surrounding sexual assault, has had a multitude of sexual assault allegations made against him by women across the film industry. In the past, he has donated large sums of money to the Democratic party as well as to both Clinton presidential campaigns and the Obama-Biden presidential campaign. Despite his financial contributions, many Democratic public officials, including the Obamas and Hillary Clinton, have publicly denounced Weinstein’s actions toward the women he sexually assaulted. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has also been giving Weinstein’s donations back to charity, rather than using them for campaigning.</p><p>Democrats have also acknowledged the allegations against their own party members and are making a point to support the women who have made them. Senator Al Franken, who was accused of kissing and groping former colleague Leeann Tweeden, was condemned by many of his Democratic colleagues. Patty Murray, the most senior Democratic woman in the Senate, spoke out as well, saying, “This is unacceptable behavior and extremely disappointing…  I hope this latest example of the deep problems on this front spurs continued action to address it." Franken himself made a public statement, apologizing for his actions before stepping down, saying, "I understand why we need to listen to and believe women's experiences." This is what we need to hear from  perpetrators of sexual assault: an understanding that what they did was wrong and the importance of listening to women who make such allegations. Further, as in this situation, they need to accept the consequences of their actions.</p><p>Not only have Democrats been supportive of women who have more recently made sexual assault allegations, but they have also been reexamining their reactions to those who made similar allegations in the past. The most prominent example of this is Bill Clinton, who at the time was defended by many Democrats who did not believe the women who were claiming he sexually assaulted them. Quite a few Democrats have since gone back on their support of Clinton, including former Clinton administration official David Rothkopf, who said Monica Lewinsky “deserves an apology from many of us she has never received.” Though this realization should have happened far sooner and should not have taken thousands of women speaking out against their oppressors, the Democratic party has taken clear steps and admitted their past wrongdoings.</p><p>Conversely, the Republican party has many politicians who vehemently deny allegations of sexual assault or do not even acknowledge them in the first place. Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Alabama senator, denies allegations that he has sexually harassed and assaulted numerous teenage girls. President Trump insists that the allegations must be false since Moore has gone through many years of public service without sexual assault having ever been brought up. Many Republicans also ignored the allegations of sexual assault against Trump himself during his presidential campaign, despite his blatant disregard for women’s personal boundaries and their consent. Looking back on his actions in 1997, when he walked backstage at the Miss Teen USA Pageant, Trump said, “You know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good. You know, the dresses. You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.” This is a statement made by a man who was elected into the White House by his Republican allies.</p><p>Sexual assault is not exclusive to or representative of any one political party, and both the Republican and Democratic parties have been guilty of belittling it. But Republicans cannot cry wolf while standing behind their president. They should take a cue from Democrats and begin their fight against sexual assault, starting with their own leaders.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 17:00:17.553048	2	1	Democrats have always been against sexual assault, not because they want women’s votes, but because they truly support women.
334	﻿Stuyvesant Holds Annual Festival of Cultures	stuyvesant-holds-annual-festival-of-cultures	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>German tongue-twisters and Chinese yo-yo performances aren’t an everyday spectacle, but they were crowd pleasers at the Culture Festival held by the language department on Friday, April 7.</p><p>In previous years, the festival was held in the cafeteria, but this year, the two-hour-long performance was held in the theater. As in previous years, the aim of the festival was to expose the audience to activities from different cultures, ranging from Spain and France to China and Germany. Performances showcased various talents such as singing, dancing, and slam poetry.</p><p>The language department hoped to engage students who would otherwise not have the chance to see and interact with the more interesting aspects of other cultures.</p><p>Students responded positively to the festival. “I had a great time seeing everyone presenting the hard work they have done preparing for the show. I loved the great mix of humor and talent throughout the show. Originally, I went for extra credit, but it was super fun and exciting,” sophomore Brandon Chong said.</p><p>Similar to Chong, many noted that although they had initially attended the festival because of academic incentives, the show far exceeded their expectations. “I went to the fair last year just to watch some of the acts, but this year part of my motivation to go was an extra credit project,” sophomore Stephanie Naing said in an e-mail interview. “[However,] the talent I saw at the festival reached far beyond my expectations. The poem recited by [junior] Mansour Elsharawy, a member of the [Muslim Students Association] really stood out to me. [It] was really well delivered and the words were extremely powerful and pertained to not just one culture or race.”</p><p>Additionally, student performers emphasized how the festival gave them a rare chance to share cultural traditions with a larger audience and to bond with fellow performers. “It was my first time performing at Stuyvesant, especially with 90 other students on stage with me. It was just heartwarming practicing our parts as a group. I love the team spirit I felt from it and it really paid off,” sophomore Amy Lei said.</p><p>Other recent cultural celebrations, including that of Dia de los Muertos and Chinese New Year, have received similar regard within the school. The language department hopes to continue this trend through holding this annual Festival of Cultures in conjunction with their other cultural celebrations. It hopes that these events will offer a needed platform with which to showcase student culture and talent.</p><p>Students also look forward to similar future performances. “It was an eye-opener for many people, including myself.  I learned a lot about the characteristics of the cultures through their dancing, and the music as well. For example, this girl danced a traditional routine from Korea which was absolutely beautiful, unlike anything I have ever learned in dance,” sophomore Meredith Silfen said. “We should recognize the importance of a school like Stuyvesant that takes the time to embrace traditions and cultures.”</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:37:02.362309	1	1	The language department organized a festival to showcase student-produced performances from different cultures on Friday, April 7.

The last time StuyPulse was awarded this honor was in 2012.</p><p>They were one of 6,000 other First Robotics Competition (FRC) teams; among them were teams from Brazil, Colombia, and Turkey. Winning the Chairman’s Award allows StuyPulse to advance to the FRC World Championship in St. Louis from April 26 to April 29. The World Championship gives the team a shot to be inducted into the FRC Hall of Fame.</p><p>Qualification for the Chairman’s Award required additional aspects of preparation, including a presentation on the team’s community and outreach projects. This presentation included an essay, executive summary, short video, and oral presentation about the team.</p><p>“It’s part of FIRST’s mission to inspire others about science and technology, and encourage them to be leaders, and as teams part of FIRST, we believe that it’s essential to stay true to its values and mission,” junior Yedoh Kang said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Heads of the StuyPULSE marketing team, senior Courtney Chiu and sophomore Lamia Bushra, presented StuyPulse’s achievements to a small panel of judges.</p><p>The theme of this year’s competition was FIRST Steamworks. The goal of the competition was to create a steampunk-themed robot using gears. The robots were tested on certain abilities. “This year the tasks the robot could complete were to pick up gears and assemble them into a machine, pick up wiffle balls and fire them at a goal, and climb up a robot to hit a button,” senior and President of Engineering Jonah Sachs-Westone said. The StuyPulse team worked on the robot over the course of six weeks before shipping it off to Florida.</p><p>The team faced a few issues while in Florida and made it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated. A fuse in the control system blew right before the final match, disqualifying them from competing.</p><p>In order to be inducted into the FRC Hall of Fame, they must win the Chairman’s Award again at the World Championships. “[The FRC Hall of Fame] features the best of the best, and because we’ve never won before, StuyPulse is definitely working really hard to be a Hall of Fame team,” Kang said.</p><p>Before heading off to St. Louis, however, StuyPulse’s next competition is the New York City Regional at the Armory Track and Field Center from April 7 to April 9. Once again, they will be competing amongst top teams from all over the world and be aiming to take home the Chairman’s Award.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:40:17.65415	1	1	Piece about StuyPulse’s win at the South Florida Regional.
338	﻿Sandler Wins Williams’s George Olmsted Jr. Class of 1924 Prize	sandler-wins-williams-s-george-olmsted-jr-class-of-1924-prize	<p>History teacher Robert Sandler won the George Olmsted Jr. Class of 1924 Prize for Excellence in Secondary School Teaching from Williams College on Friday, March 10. He was nominated by former student, Aglaia Ho (’13), who was in Sandler’s AP United States History and New York City History classes.</p><p>The Olmsted Prize is awarded every year to four high school teachers during Williams’ “Ivy Exercises,” an award ceremony Williams holds annually. Every year, Williams seniors are given the opportunity to nominate a teacher that played an influential role in their education and lives for the award. Seniors who decide to participate have to submit an essay explaining the impact their teacher made on them.</p><p>Teachers are then notified of their nomination and are asked to submit an essay explaining their teaching philosophies and provide examples of exemplary student projects.</p><p>In his essay, Sandler wrote about the various activities he uses to engage students. “I conduct walking tours, have a lot of guest speakers, and use simulations with historical figures,” Sandler said in an e-mail interview. He also explained how he attempts to incorporate music and art into his lessons.</p><p>Williams also requested  recommendation letters from colleagues or supervisors.“I had to get recommendations from [Assistant Principal of Social Studies Jennifer] Suri, the principal [Eric] Contreras, and James Basker, the President of the Gilder Lehrman Institute for American History,” Sandler said.</p><p>“I thought he had a really great chance [of winning] because he’s such a great teacher. I know [his] students are very enthusiastic and many of his students still keep in touch with him and have written letters to him about the impact that he had on their lives and careers,” Suri said.</p><p>After applications were submitted, a committee of faculty, staff, and Williams juniors chose four winners who would each be given $3000 and an additional $5000 would be awarded to their schools.</p><p>Williams will cover the cost of the trip to the award ceremony on Saturday, June 3, for the recipients and their families, along with the honorary degree recipients. Attendees will go to a luncheon with both the Olmsted committee and the student nominators and their families. Afterwards, at the Class Day “Ivy Exercises,” the dean of Williams will present each recipient and the student that nominated them.</p><p>Sandler is looking forward to the award ceremony. “I have never been to the Berkshires and I think it will be really fun to meet my old student and her family at the ceremony,” Sandler said.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Sandler has won an award for his teaching. In 2013, he won the National Council for the Social Studies National Teacher of the Year Award and an award through the 9/11 Tribute Center for creating a curriculum unit on 9/11. In 2014, he was awarded the New York State History Teacher of the Year Award presented by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, after being nominated by his former student, Mitchell Teper (’15).</p><p>Senior Prangon Ghose, who was in Sandler’s Jewish History class and is now in his New York City History class, believes that a part of what makes Sandler deserving of the award is that he inspires his students to learn more about topics beyond what is taught in class. “It is not always that one has a teacher like Mr. Sandler. I think he truly cares for the students he teaches and strives to provide better learning opportunities for them outside of the classroom,” Ghose said in an e-mail interview. “Mr. Sandler truly deserves this award and he serves as a strong example to teachers around the country that they can make important changes in a student's life that makes him [or] her a better person. Awards like the Olmsted Award are important to impress upon our society that teaching is an [influential] profession.”</p><p>Sandler plans on spending the $5000 given to the social studies department from this award to buy books, films, and to go on field trips with his elective classes. He hopes that winning this award will help change the common public perception of teachers. “It will be a small step in counteracting negative stereotypes about teachers,” Sandler said. “I love my job and respect my colleagues intensely. There are so many hardworking teachers that stay [until] 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. and work all weekend. They all deserve recognition.”</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:41:18.087323	1	1	History teacher Robert Sandler will be awarded the George Olmsted, Jr., Class of 1924 Prize at Williams College on the weekend of Saturday, June 3.

However, the transgender community at Stuyvesant often goes unheard and unnoticed. Meet four transgender Stuyvesant students who each have something unique and special to add to the Stuyvesant community.</p><p><b>Eleanor Loprest, Agender (They/them)</b></p><p>Freshman Eleanor Loprest has always had a strong grasp of music. They first gravitated towards the piano at the age of two and a half, and they have sharpened their skills ever since, discovering their passion for singing and composing along the way.</p><p>However, Loprest’s understanding of gender is not nearly as strong as their understanding of music. In fact, they don’t have any grasp whatsoever on the concept of gender.</p><p>Loprest is perplexed by the gender binary, and thus does not identify as any gender at all. Instead, Loprest identifies as agender, a label used to indicate the lack of a gender identity.</p><p>Since coming to Stuyvesant, Loprest has found that their gender identity—or lack thereof—has confused many of their peers and teachers.</p><p>Yet, most people Loprest has encountered at Stuyvesant have made an effort to understand and respect Loprest’s identity despite their confusion, referring to Loprest with their preferred pronouns (they/them/their) and correcting people who misgender them.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people have a harder time using Loprest’s correct pronouns, like a teacher who resorted to not referring to Loprest with any pronouns and simply addressing them as “Eleanor.”</p><p>Seldom has Loprest felt directly attacked for being agender since coming to Stuyvesant, but there have been several instances where people have treated Loprest’s identity as a joke or insisted on addressing them with she/her pronouns.</p><p>Loprest has found the most welcoming communities at Stuyvesant to be the people they met through participating in the eighth period chorus, where they sing in the soprano 1 section, and Stuyvesant Spectrum, the SPARK club geared towards promoting LGBTQ+ causes and advocacy.</p><p>“My first thought when coming to Stuy[vesant] was ‘I need to find the queer people,’” they said. Since coming to Spectrum, they are happy to say that they have found the queer people they had been looking for and that they have a strong, passionate support system in a school that can sometimes feel so impersonal.</p><p>Stuyvesant is a challenge for everyone who walks through the cold metal doors of the bridge entrance each morning, but Loprest has begun their journey with their head held high. An intellectually curious person with high aspirations, they are happy to be at Stuyvesant. Despite the occasional bothersome and mildly transphobic comment, Loprest remains unfazed, and with an unbreakable smile across their face, they say, “A school stomping on my identity will not stop me from existing.”</p><p><b>Connie Walden, Genderqueer (They/them)</b></p><p>From the band room to the SPARK office, junior Connie Walden, with artificially colored hair and a distinct androgynous style, can be seen in all corners of the building carrying a messenger bag adorned with scores of pins.</p><p>Walden, a hacker, a trumpeter, a poet, and an activist, has made a name for themself in several ways since coming to Stuyvesant, but what many don’t know about Walden is that they identify as genderqueer and prefer to be addressed by they/them pronouns.</p><p>Since realizing they were gender non-binary in the beginning of their sophomore year, they have chosen to keep their gender identity relatively under the radar at Stuyvesant. “I don’t want it to be a defining factor of who I am. It’s not something that I want to be a big deal in my life,” they remarked, well aware that coming out as genderqueer entails confusion and possible harassment from peers.</p><p>Because Walden is well-acquainted with many different social circles at Stuyvesant, they are afraid that coming out to everyone at Stuyvesant will limit who they can be friends with.</p><p>They have found that many of their socially conservative friends make offensive jokes about non-binary genders and the transgender community as a whole. This practice doesn’t hurt Walden on a personal level, but is something they wish would stop.</p><p>Nevertheless, Walden has come out to many of their peers, facing a mixed array of reactions, not all of which have been positive.</p><p>For example, when they decided to wear eyeliner to school one day, they received several perplexed and sour glances, many of whom were from boys in the boys’ bathroom and locker room. “I’ve also received many positive, enthusiastic responses [to coming out], but they’re hard to notice when you’re scared to death of the negative responses,” Walden said.</p><p>While Walden has not found it easy to fully express their gender at Stuyvesant, they are taking cautious baby steps on their way to being comfortably out of the closet. “I’m out to several teachers, and I even go by Connie in some of my classes,” they said.</p><p>However, though many of Walden’s teachers are supportive and understanding, others harbor an old-fashioned mindset and don’t have a good understanding of what it means to be genderqueer.</p><p>To help people better understand matters involving the transgender community and other marginalized communities, Walden has dedicated much of their time to the causes they believe in. Recently, with the help of SPARK, they co-founded a publication at Stuyvesant with junior Pacy Yan called StuySpeaks, a space for underrepresented minorities to voice their struggles for liberation and social and economic equality.</p><p>Walden is also making a difference in the greater New York City community by volunteering at Bluestockings, a feminist, trans-friendly bookstore and café on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Walden described the environment of Bluestockings as radical, but comfortable.</p><p>“At Bluestockings, you don’t feel weird because of the gender you identify as. All volunteers are mandated to introduce themselves by their pronouns,” Walden explained.</p><p>Walden is also the president of StuyHack,  a math and computer science enthusiast, and is equally invested in music and writing. Walden plays the trumpet for the Stuyvesant jazz band and won a Scholastic Gold Key Award for poetry this year.</p><p>The next time you see Walden roaming around the Stuyvesant building, don’t be shy to approach them, because you’ll be bound to spark up an intriguing conversation of your own.</p><p><b>Kiran Vuksanaj, Female (She/her)</b></p><p>Like many people whose middle school experiences were subpar, freshman Kiran Vuksanaj came to Stuyvesant looking to reinvent herself. However, to Vuksanaj, this meant more than a drastic change in style—she was going to begin publicly presenting as female. Starting high school was a chance for her to introduce herself to people by her preferred name, Kiran, and her preferred pronouns, she/her. “It’d be easier for people to get used to calling me by my preferred name and pronouns, since it’s not like they have to unlearn the old [name and pronouns],” Vuksanaj explained.</p><p>Vuksanaj had known she was a transgender girl since she was twelve years old, and even before she knew what the word “transgender” meant, she knew she never felt comfortable being called a boy.</p><p>Before she came to Stuyvesant, she was only out to several close friends and family members.  Now, she has made sure that the Stuyvesant administration and all of her peers and teachers know her preferred name and pronouns.</p><p>Vuksanaj’s mother explained her situation to the Stuyvesant administration, and they did all they could to accommodate her. “They really do try and support me, which feels amazing. I’m allowed to use the right bathroom, and I have the right name on my ID card next to my legal name,” Vuksanaj noted.</p><p>She has also found the SPARK office and Spectrum, Stuyvesant’s gender and sexuality alliance, to be incredibly helpful resources. The SPARK office, as the school’s designated safe space, gives her a sense of social and emotional support.</p><p>Likewise, Spectrum has proven to be a passionate and supportive community of students, many of whom are transgender themselves.</p><p>Since coming to Stuyvesant, Vuksanaj has made an effort to surround herself with good people. She has particularly involved herself with Spectrum and the Transit Association, and she hopes to join more clubs in the future.</p><p>However, with every new club she has tried out, she has made sure to choose her friends wisely. “I know there are people [at Stuyvesant] who wouldn’t respect me, but I’ve done my best to avoid them,” she told me, though she said that she has occasionally heard derogatory comments in passing.</p><p>Through the Transit Association, Vuksanaj has been able to express her passion for transit systems. Reflecting on her love for trains, she said, “When I get into things, I get really into them.” As such, she has spent the past year expanding her knowledge of the MTA, exploring obscure buses and trains, and learning about their history.</p><p>Somewhat connected to her love of trains is her love of physics. Physics was Vuksanaj’s favorite subject in middle school, and she has considered it as a potential career option for the far future.</p><p>As a biracial and bisexual transgender girl, she knows that she is rather underrepresented in scientific fields, but, if anything, that has only further encouraged her. “I remember searching the internet for trans women who were successful in scientific fields, and finding out who they were was a really exciting and hope-filling moment for me,” she remarked.</p><p>A kind person with a passion for how things work, Vuksanaj has enjoyed her time at Stuyvesant thus far. She hopes to continue to make friends here and blossom as a scientist and a train enthusiast. Though it is not often that we see transgender women of color working in our labs, Vuksanaj can help pave the way for future Stuyvesant students, because she is a trailblazer in her own right.</p><p><b>Kris Khalilova, Genderfluid (They/them)</b></p><p>As soon as I sat down with sophomore Kris Khalilova for their interview, they were eager to tell me their emotional rollercoaster of a coming out story from start to finish.</p><p>Khalilova’s coming out story is quite unusual, because they came out as both pansexual and genderfluid, two labels entirely foreign to Khalilova’s traditional Russian family. “My parents are homophobic, so I grew up with a lot of internalized homophobia,” Khalilova remarked.</p><p>As such, Khalilova struggled with familial and self-acceptance when first discovering their identity, but it is these revelations that would shape the next chapter of Khalilova’s life.</p><p>At the time that Khalilova realized that they did not feel comfortable restricting themselves to a male or female gender identity, several of their middle school friends came to similar realizations.</p><p>Khalilova’s friends provided a sense of safety and community amidst a world of chaos and confusion. It was then that they and their friends were beginning the gruesome process of applying to high school.</p><p>For Khalilova, this process was especially challenging, because they had to research each school they considered applying to to determine whether or not it was a safe place for queer and transgender individuals.</p><p>When it came to making a final decision, Khalilova chose Stuyvesant because they had read in a news article that it was an LGBTQ+ friendly school.</p><p>Upon coming to Stuyvesant, however, they have found that this is not always the case. According to Khalilova, Stuyvesant is only “sort of okay” in terms of LGBTQ+ friendliness.</p><p>They seldom experience outright harassment for their identity, but they presume that is because they look traditionally female enough to pass as cisgender and straight.</p><p>Nevertheless, they hear people make derogatory jokes at the expense of the transgender community and patronizingly refer to transgender people as “special snowflakes,” comments that make them feel particularly uncomfortable. However, they know that most of these comments come from a place of ignorance and not hate.</p><p>“I may pass as female and have many of the societal advantages and disadvantages distinct to the female gender, but I am not a girl,” they told me matter-of-factly.</p><p>As a genderfluid person, Khalilova does not identify as a single gender—their gender identity varies by day. “Some days, I feel very girly, and other [days], I’m like, ‘Hey! I’m a dude!’ Sometimes I feel like neither,” they explained. For this reason, they feel that the gender neutral pronouns “they/them” fit them best.</p><p>The most open-minded, welcoming, and kind people Khalilova has met at Stuyvesant have been at Spectrum. A regular attendee of the club, they have found a sense of belonging there and made several lasting friendships. To Khalilova, Spectrum has been an especially helpful resource to have when their identity has left them at odds with their parents.</p><p>“Even though I have come out to my mom, she still refers to me as her daughter, and the only time my dad has ever spoken to me about my sexuality or gender was when he told me to take down the pride flag in my room because our relatives were coming over,” they said.</p><p>Though coming out has not been the easiest journey for Khalilova, they feel especially fortunate to be surrounded by good people at Stuyvesant.</p><p>A sweet, amiable person, all they wish is that Stuyvesant students would be more accepting of their transgender peers. “If someone you know has trusted you enough to tell you their true gender identity, don’t question them. Just love and accept them for who they are,” Khalilova advises the student body.</p><p>Even if you don’t consider yourself to be transphobic, they suggest you give their words some thought. After all, if everyone heeded Khalilova’s advice, Stuyvesant would be a significantly better place.</p><p><hr/></p><p>No two transgender students at Stuyvesant are the same, but they all have something in common: they are unique, creative individuals who, with their distinct brands of intellectual curiosity, are able to make Stuyvesant their home.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:43:01.910282	3	1	Spread featuring trans kids at Stuy who talk about their high school experience and their experience being trans.

Without hesitation, European leaders used the attack as an opportunity to further their anti-Muslim immigration rhetoric. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader and presidential candidate, immediately condemned the attack in London, not by offering her condolences, but by asserting that “we must control our borders.”</p><p>This rhetoric plays into the larger narrative of fearing and halting immigration championed by Le Pen and her Front Nationale. In the aftermaths of the attacks in Paris, Nice, and now London, other European leaders have also advocated for barring immigration. Nigel Farage used these attacks to bolster his anti-immigration platform during the Brexit vote, playing off of the fear of terror attacks within Europe.</p><p>During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump also played off of the fear of terrorism and issued an executive order which barred entry of anyone from several countries in the Middle East, such as Syria, Libya, and Iraq, into the United States. Although this order was shut down in the Federal Court system, the intent to further discriminate against migrants and visa-holders alike from Muslim nations remains in the administration.</p><p>This narrative is little more than fear-mongering. Masood was born and raised in the United Kingdom to British parents. He was a citizen radicalized within the country.</p><p>In France and much of Europe, Muslims have had a contentious history with the rest of the population. Many Muslims immigrated to Europe during the period of decolonization in the 1950s and ‘60s, but were forced to live in slums and among the lowest rungs of society. There was little effort from European governments, who saw them as temporary workers, to assimilate these populations. Alienated from contemporary society by both governments and people alike, Muslims in Europe have had a lot to resent, which has made them a prime target for radicalization.</p><p>But how does this relate to modern-day radicalization? The answer is that Muslims in Europe have not yet moved out of the slums they occupied 50 years ago, and because of their lower standing in society, they have also been targets of recruitment from terror groups. Masood was allegedly radicalized by Sheikh Abu Hamza, an Imam in England who was recently arrested for inciting terror. The New York Times notes that homegrown terror has taken a greater toll than jihadis coming from the Middle East, and yet the rhetoric of our politicians tends to focus on threats outside of our country rather than inside.</p><p>Le Pen is an outspoken proponent of the French ideal of Laicite, the full assimilation of religious minorities into the mainstream. This belief permeates her speeches and her support of policies, such as the now-infamous Burkini ban. But instead of assimilating Muslims, this belief only serves to increase resentment in Europe’s Muslim communities, as Jeffrey Reitz, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto, explains. He believes that “many young Muslim women feel an underlying resentment. They have to take off the headscarf when they get to school, but they put it back on immediately when they leave, feeling that it’s an important way to defend their identity.”</p><p>It is clear that the reactionary speeches and policies coming from Europe’s leaders aren’t solving any problems, but there is a way for European leaders to fight radicalization. The first action these leaders can take is to work with Muslim communities to better understand the problems that these communities face. There is a lack of Muslim representation within local and national European politics, which causes governments to be unable to address the issues of their Muslim populations.</p><p>Second, governments need to provide more resources to these communities, which, on average, receive less government benefits and attention: in France, entire Muslim neighborhoods are left unpoliced. In the 1950s, European governments pushed Muslim immigrants into shantytowns and largely ignored them, and for the past 70 years, this has not changed.</p><p>Most importantly, Europeans need to be more accepting of Islam. Secularism in Europe is different than in the United States; across the pond, it means the general abdication of religion by the mainstream. This is why policies, such as the Burkini-ban, are so hotly contested within Muslim communities: their need to maintain key elements of their culture comes at odds with the rest of society, which wants them to abandon their culture entirely.</p><p>Retaliatory rhetoric does little to help in the fight against radicalization and terror. Yet, in the wake of terrorist attacks, the public finds solace in these very words coming from politicians. If we want to end the issue of radicalization in both Europe and in the United States, we should instead expect our leaders to pursue policies that solve these issues and espouse rhetoric that does not alienate our Muslim populations.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:43:20.351529	2	1	
343	﻿A Moral Economy	a-moral-economy	<p>Outqoutes: “we need to prevent growing wealth inequality by encouraging a wider distribution of capital between firms and employees”</p><p>A little more than eight years ago today, the world was on the brink of utter collapse. While many of us were adjusting to a new school year, our parents, teachers, neighbors, and everyone else were overwhelmed with anxiety as they saw markets tumble. Despite the government’s attempts to remedy anxiety arising from the crash, the  U.S. economy has had a sluggish recovery and its people and businesses are in enormous debt. In short, the 2008 financial crash radically changed our economic system; it looms over us as a foreboding warning of dangers of our economy.</p><p>The 2008 crash came as a surprise; mainstream economists believed that the current system was stable and could provide unseen prosperity. In fact, they not only failed to predict the crash but have also been unable to create models to explain it. This inability shows that our economic system is fundamentally flawed. Specifically, our system focuses not on providing for the welfare of the people but on generating wealth through primarily financial ways. By analyzing the flaws that caused the 2008 crash, we can construct an economic system that does not exist solely to create wealth but rather to uplift others and help everyone live meaningful lives.</p><p>First, our economy is based on the idea that humans, institutions, and corporations are self-interested entities concerned with the maximization of their pleasure and the value of their shareholders. Therefore, economic transactions are thought of as joint meetings of two entirely separate individual interests.</p><p>Due to this self-interested view of human nature, our economic system reduces goods to their material significance to ensure the vast creation of wealth. I have lived in a house for the past four years. Over that time, I have formed countless memories with my neighbors and family. I am unable to separate material shelter and emotional significance when I think about my home. However, this separation is exactly what our economic system does. In the case of a house or land, it severs symbolic significance and only considers certain material aspects in valuing the property, commodifying goods into fungible assets.</p><p>This reduction allows bankers to construct a speculative and interconnected financial system. Consider a market for coffee beans with a going price of $10 per pound. Suppose I want to be able to buy 100 pounds of coffee for $11 two months from now. I would draw up a contract, called a derivative, with a farmer for the right to buy those coffee beans, and the contract would cost me an upfront premium. If in two months the price goes up to $15, I can sell the contract for a profit. In this process, no goods and services were moved and I didn’t care about the actual coffee beans, but capital was still generated. This example with coffee beans, which can be loosely applied to housing, shows how modern capitalism creates wealth not by trade or increasing production, but from other wealth. As a result, the wealth generated is disconnected from real world value.</p><p>Moreover, this system privileges financial institutions and banks over the people they serve. In regards to housing, banks exploit the need of the socio-economically disempowered for security by offering them loans at high interest rates. Consider Chicago resident Ida Mae Whitley, whose story is told in The Washington Post. At 62, she wanted to buy a nice house to retire in and so she was seduced by banks to take a high interest loan. Ultimately, she was put at risk to lose her home and lower her credit score because she couldn’t meet her monthly payments, hindering her ability to get more loans. Therefore, the financial system does not trickle down wealth but rather accumulates it at the top. The poor go further into debt and spend their spare money to pay down already lucrative borrowers, who use it to generate more wealth through capital gains.</p><p>No wonder the bottom 80 percent of Americans have only seven percent of the United States’s wealth. Despite this problem, proponents of capitalism suggest that the current system, which seeks wealth first, is the best possible way to lift people out of poverty and provide for their basic needs. At worst, the socially and economically disempowered, left behind by our economic system, are given welfare in the hope that the pocket change they receive can make up for the emotional damage that comes with being out of work and being unable to reintegrate into the workforce.</p><p>If we are to change our economic system, we must base it on a fundamentally different view of human nature. In line with the moral framework I proposed in “The Good Life,” I forward that the economy is not an end in itself but rather a means to an end, which is to help humans live virtuous lives. Therefore, economic transactions should be a reciprocal agreement about a shared goal of uplifting others between the parties.</p><p>Under this model, corporations have a social responsibility to their community and employees. This responsibility would take the form of a legal requirement that each company have a mission statement of long-term economic and social benefit to its community. A contemporary example of this is the British grocery retailer Tesco. The company cut the sugar content of all of its U.K. soft drinks by 20 percent from 2011 to 2016. The company is also a founder member of the World Cocoa Foundation and World Banana Forum, which exist to raise labor standards. With companies like Tesco, investors should be long-term holders who are committed to the company’s mission, instead of short-term shareholders who solely invest for profit.</p><p>Moreover, this model ties the lending of money to material investment: for instance,  by viewing debt in more relational terms in which profit and risk are shared by the lender and borrower. That is, borrowers would be stakeholders in the enterprises they invest in. One way of accomplishing this is to convert debt, which raises money by borrowing it and then repaying it, into equity, which raises money by selling portions of an asset. For example, if a family wants to buy a house, they take out a loan with a certain amount of interest from the bank, requiring them to pay back a portion every month. An equity-based model would have the family take out a mortgage in which the banks become part-owners. Every month the family would pay the bank a small rental fee to live in the property and then periodically buy part of the house owned by the bank. The bank now has a stake in the family’s well-being and the well-being of the community because its success is tied directly the community’s success. Moreover, the family has a lower risk of personal bankruptcy and repossession, which is economically costly and socially traumatic. Similar programs can be extended into consumer loans and commercial real estate.</p><p>We should also encourage the use of credit unions, which are banks in which the depositors are members and owners. First, since the members are owners, the bank is tied to the community, giving it a higher chance of investing in beneficial entreprises. Second, credit unions provide competitive interest rates and a broad range or loans and savings programs. Providing tax breaks and privileged access to credit to these banks would further encourage a system which prioritizes saving over debt-financing and fosters civil enterprises for the good of the community.</p><p>Furthermore, we need to prevent growing wealth inequality by encouraging a better distribution of capital between firms and employees. This includes encouraging employee stock ownership plans, which provide a layer of security and strengthen the bond between employee and employer. Second, this model means instituting a living wage at the national level and creating a system to negotiate family wages in varying locations. Workers would be less likely  to go into debt to finance expenditures, which increases consumer spending and in turn tax revenues. These revenues can be used to lower income taxes across the board  and provide tax benefits for small businesses.</p><p>Finally, higher wages and the wider distribution of capital should be complemented with a holistic education system that professionalizes the labor force. This can be accomplished through creating pathways of learning that fuse class-learning with vocational training for professions. Moreover, providing apprenticeships for various fields can create high-skilled and adaptable workers. Germany has a system similar to this model, in which apprenticeships are split between class instruction and training. For example, salesmen learn retail trade and management, construction workers learn civil engineering, and truck drivers learn logistics. In this way, workers have professionalized skills which are also adaptable to a wide range of careers.</p><p>The idea is that the goal of the economy is to serve society by strengthening social bonds, generating trust, and provide meaningful work. This is not to completely disavow the market system; rather, a moral society needs a moral economy that teaches us not to make money at the expense of others but rather teaches us to love, trust, care, and respect each other.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:45:28.998094	2	1	A Moral Society Needs a Moral Economy
344	﻿Oh, the Places We’ll Go: The Two-Way Street of College Applications	oh-the-places-we-ll-go-the-two-way-street-of-college-applications	<p>Four years of our lives boil down to four pages: the college application. We spend high school chasing college acceptance, obsessively competing with our friends for grades, leadership positions, and a seat at an elite university. We pour countless hours into perfecting how we look on paper rather than focusing on what we can learn from our high school experience.</p><p>Senior year comes with a mountain of stress and expectations; at Stuyvesant, everything is about the Ivy Leagues, and not getting into a dream school feels like a kick in the guts. Many students tend to self-deprecate when they are rejected even though they may have been perfectly qualified for the school. Yet, we have been taught that subjecting ourselves to this is a rite of passage.</p><p>With severely understaffed college and guidance offices, students find themselves stuck with these negative mentalities and without a proper support system.</p><p>To deal with thousands of students, the college and guidance offices look to the most efficient solution: mass emails. These emails are addressed to both parents and students, discussing what seem like the most important part of our adolescent lives. Though they attempt to expand college options beyond the famed Ivy League schools and reassure students, many of us feel that we have to go through this arduous process alone.</p><p>Despite certain resources, a relationship experienced over a computer screen cannot compare to a more meaningful, in-person relationship, in which a student can feel more supported through the often tiring and confusing college process.</p><p>Additionally, while there is an SSR meeting set up for each junior with his or her guidance counselor for the student to discuss the process, oftentimes, the guidance counselor does not reach out beyond the SSR meeting. Students will only receive support if they take the initiative to seek it out.</p><p>It is no doubt an overwhelmingly difficult task to advocate for yourself when you don’t know where to start. At 17, we may find ourselves scrambling for answers when there is no one to but us to teach our immigrant parents how to be what we need.</p><p>As of now, college counselors introduce juniors to the process with only an informative assembly during an English class and a thirty-minute private meeting with the student and his or her parents — not enough to provide serious, detailed answers.</p><p>Despite being a Title I school, the guidance office only glosses over financial aid opportunities. "It would be cool to get information about direct loans or scholarship programs so people who are making a tough decision have as much help as they can get," senior Shaik Abiden said.</p><p>The blame doesn’t fall solely on the shoulders of the college and guidance offices, since they are forced to deal with inadequate resources. In response, many students resort to facebook groups, which consist of recent Stuyvesant graduates and seniors giving anecdotal advice. However, those giving advice are generally students who have been accepted into elite schools; at times, they provide misinformation and cannot advise the general population.</p><p>Even after they have submitted their college applications, seniors face numerous problems, particularly after results are released. Aside from an email sent out to students about facing rejection, the college office does not directly reach out to students.Though receiving rejections from colleges can be a huge emotional blow, many students feel too estranged from the college and guidance offices to seek emotional support. On the bright side, it is made clear that the college and guidance offices have open doors.</p><p>Accepted students face problems as well, and many don’t understand the importance of choosing among financial packages. Seniors tend to receive limited help in deciding which school is the right fit for them, both academically and financially.</p><p>The first step to improving the college process is to communicate more closely with students and their families. The school could make automated phone calls and alert students about what they need to do for the college process and notify parents about upcoming college workshops. There also needs to be clearer support in both financial aid and mental health.</p><p>But ultimately, in a school of about 3,000 students, where guidance counselors have to write SSRs for over 100 students, it is up to us to take the initiative and reach out to guidance. We should be making sure that our counselors know who we are and develop a healthy relationship with our advisors—not just because they will be able to write better recommendations, but because we will also have an easier time finding much-needed insight. The college process should be a two-way street.</p><p>Four years of our lives do not boil down to four pages; we should not treat high school like an extended college interview. It shouldn’t be a burden or a source of anxiety — it should be a dynamic journey.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:45:52.914233	8	1	
346	﻿The Issue of Masculinity in Disney Princes	the-issue-of-masculinity-in-disney-princes	<p>Growing up, I’d always love watching “Mulan,” not just because the soundtrack was incredibly addicting to sing along with, but also because there was finally a movie with people of my race. But I never felt much of a connection between myself and the male lead, Li Shang, a tall, handsome military leader who trains soldiers; I am a short kid who can barely get through Ms. Rosenthal’s laps around the gym.</p><p>Another one of my favorite films was “Hercules,” but again, I was never really able to relate to Hercules. Slaying the Hydra, fighting titans, and saving Meg—all awe-inspiring feats and surely nothing I could do. How could I, a mere scrawny mortal, see myself in the shoes of such a strong, muscular, and celebrated hero?</p><p>Over time, Disney’s princesses have progressively become more developed and independent, breaking away from the original “damsel-in-distress” trope. The classic Aurora from “Sleeping Beauty,” who is asleep for the majority of the film and is only saved by her Prince Philip, seems more like a supporting character and plot device in her own film; a more recent character, Moana, saves her tribe and encourages them to become more adventurous while never depending on a man. But on the opposite end of the spectrum, most of Disney’s princes have remained the same “heroes-to-the-rescue,” from Li Shang to Aladdin to John Smith. Despite having their fair share of more gentle and romantic moments, such as Aladdin’s talk with Genie about his crush on Jasmine or John Smith being taught by Pocahontas about the wonders of nature, these characters ultimately remain the macho men.</p><p>The problem with this two-dimensionality in male characters is that many boys feel that the only suitable role they can fit is the dependable buff guy who has a weak girl depending on him. For example, in one of the songs from “Mulan,” “A Girl Worth Fighting For,” the soldiers sing about their ideal women. When Mulan says she would prefer women to be smart and outspoken, she is rejected by the other men, who sing about beautiful girls who would admire them for their strength, which influences younger audiences into believing that the only girls worth loving are the beautiful ones, and the only way to attract them is by showing off sheer dominance and masculinity—the exact opposite message Disney is trying to teach.</p><p>In addition, those few male characters with passive personalities or more effeminate appearances tend to be minor comical characters or villains, such as Merida’s boisterous father from “Brave” or the tall and slender Jafar from “Aladdin.” As a result, boys are not taught that it is okay to be themselves if they are just kind-hearted or fun-loving, but rather, to be stoic men whose worth are defined by muscle size. They are only taught to suppress their emotions, to make women depend on them, and to “man up.”</p><p>The origins of this issue stem from commonly defined gender roles in which men are expected to be the dominant, assertive voice and head of the household, whereas women are expected to be more submissive and simply do housework. For instance, in certain conservative sects of Christianity, women are still expected to not work, be obedient to their husbands, and are prohibited from serving as priests, popes, etc. Although the gender division in modern society has recently been blurred, men and women are still not equal.</p><p>Fortunately, some of the most recent Disney princes have strayed from the stereotypical “tough guy” image. Take Prince Naveen from “The Princess and the Frog.” While he is still an average, handsome romantic, he also depicts less masculine traits, such as naivete and clumsiness, causing his female counterpart Tiana to arguably be the more dominant character of the two. And despite not technically being considered a “Disney prince,” Kristoff from “Frozen” also demonstrates his kind-hearted, sensitive nature, and he ultimately does not play the “hero-to-the-rescue” as many of his predecessors have. Most recently, Maui from “Moana” plays the role of Moana’s friend and sidekick rather than Moana’s savior over the course of the film. As a result, young boys who watch future Disney movies will hopefully have a larger variety of role models who should inspire them to be less macho and more caring.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:47:44.597182	13	1	Disney princes have mainly been the same stereotypical muscular guys who go on to rescue the princess, which is not a good inspiration for young boys watching them.
348	﻿Beauties, Beasts, and in Between	beauties-beasts-and-in-between	<p>The fable of “Beauty and the Beast” first appeared over 250 years ago and has since  become an iconic and beloved fairytale. Bill Condon’s live action “Beauty and the Beast” (2017), Disney’s remake of their 1991 animated version, proves that despite the story’s long history, it is neither old-fashioned nor stagnant. Instead, the tale’s cautionary messages regarding the importance of inner beauty and tolerance make it a timeless classic, providing generation after generation with powerful role models.</p><p>The storyline, despite its infamy, is captivating. While staying true to the original plot, “Beauty and the Beast” is infused with scenes and moments that expand upon the story and solidify its morals, making it grow into a modern fairytale. It focuses more on Belle’s (Emma Watson) independence and capabilities, as she becomes more than a bookworm and changes into a wise and strong-willed figure.</p><p>Emma Watson displays her talent as an actress, as she instills within Belle an internal dignity and resolve that elevates the entire film. At times, she is determined with a steely demeanor, exhibited in defense of her father. At others, Belle displays a softer side, such as when she cares for the Beast (Dan Stevens). Watson is able to present Belle as a multifaceted and evolving individual, while emphasizing the character's defining aspects—her tolerance and potential.</p><p>Belle’s ability and skills are expanded upon within the film as well. Through her actions, Belle displays herself as a self-assured and capable young woman, driven by Watson’s genuine belief in public outreach about the empowerment of women. Rather than focusing on her own alienation within the community, Belle extends a hand to try and invite change, as seen in the scene where she teaches a young girl to read and boldly faces the backlash from her community. We see her as an innovator—laboring, thinking, creating—displaying her self-discipline and drive to be stimulated intellectually. Through small moments in which its characters show dignity in the face of hardship, “Beauty and the Beast” becomes a powerful tool for teaching self-worth and resilience.</p><p>The other characters are no less developed. The film expands upon the Beast’s narrative, revealing more about his difficult family background and showing his depth as a character: how he came to be so cold and disinterested as to warrant such a curse and why he deserved salvation. Though his initial cruelty is more pronounced, behind it lies a man tortured by loneliness, mistrust, abandonment, and despair—a man who can be vulnerable and surrender himself to unconditional and, more painfully, unrequited love. Dan Stevens’s performance is powerful and displays incredible range; ironically, he truly fleshes out the Beast’s character as achingly human. As the relationship between the two title characters develops, the Beast reveals a kindness beyond his cold exterior, brought out by Belle’s faith in him and his devotion to her.</p><p>The relationship between Belle and the Beast is the heart of this movie, and “Beauty and the Beast” is able to mold it into powerfully positive themes that serve as a model for young viewers. It makes a clear distinction between the failures marking the relationship’s rocky start and its progression into true affection. Only when the two are able to overcome their dislike for one another and treat each other with compassion and kindness does true emotion develop, and the importance of looking beyond exteriors is showcased.</p><p>At the same time, the film explores darker themes through Gaston (Luke Evans) and his role in the plot. Though his tremendous ego and superficiality immediately give him away as an unlikeable character, underneath is a truly sinister persona. His manipulative nature is impeccably portrayed as Evans’s face morphs into one of sickening insincerity, and his voice gains a melodic quality not present in its usually deep timbre as he capitalizes on his charm to manipulate the people. He becomes a character not only genuinely frightening, but also hauntingly familiar from a modern perspective, in a film that warns against blindly following charismatic leaders.</p><p>The original movie was widely renowned for its soundtrack, and in this area “Beauty and the Beast” also shines. The vocals in the film are full and powerful, and the musical numbers are endlessly entertaining. While the original songs are done great justice, “Be Our Guest” is nothing short of a breathtaking, colorful musical extravaganza, with endless formation changes and a loud, harmonic chorus.</p><p>The new numbers that are introduced in some ways surpass the originals. “Evermore,” the Beast’s ballad expressing his heartache at Belle’s departure, is not only beautifully executed, but contains a rare sophistication within its lyrics and composition. Dan Stevens’s booming voice fills the grand crescendos with heart-wrenching emotion, simultaneously providing a brilliant musical performance and expanding the depth of his character in a voice that captures true heartbreak.</p><p>The film truly is a sight for sore eyes, with a whimsical set and masterful costumes. Belle’s iconic yellow dress is even more breathtaking in the live action film, with a delicate, flowing skirt that shimmers and makes every movement graceful. Each costume is intricate, and even the minor characters are given attention, as in the opening ball scene where an array of white dresses with intricate lace, each unique, is seen.</p><p>The sets are likewise beautiful, infused with vibrant colors of meadows and Belle’s quaint provincial town, characterized by a modest, but homey design. The graphics allow the film to truly emulate a magical kingdom that is impossible to find in the real world, with the Beast’s imposing yet elegant castle of towers that seems lifelike in spite of the darkness clouding it.</p><p>“Beauty and the Beast” ticks off all the boxes. It is a film that gives and gives, creating an experience that is not only immensely enjoyable but also productive and inspiring. Ultimately empowering in its messages of the perseverance of good and the power lying behind external appearances, it leaves viewers with a sense of lightness and hope, reinforcing the potential within kindness to stimulate change. It provides young viewers with valuable lessons, teaching young girls they are capable and strong and reinforcing the importance of education and making your own decisions. This enlightened, relatable fairytale proves to the world that tradition and progress are compatible, meaningful, and bold, even evoking faith in the lost notion of “happily ever after.”</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:50:14.517299	13	1	
352	﻿“InTransit” Takes a Ride Through the New York Experience	intransit-takes-a-ride-through-the-new-york-experience	<p>We all know how important the New York subway system is, as most of us use it to travel the city, including riding to and from Stuyvesant every day. Thousands of passengers board each day from all over, navigating around hundreds of stations across the five boroughs, praying there aren’t any major delays or reroutes that make it harder to reach their destination. “InTransit,” the new Broadway musical at the Circle in the Square Theater, not only uses the subway system as a framing device for its story, but also as the core instrument of the show.</p><p>“InTransit” is the first a capella musical on Broadway, relying solely on the voices of the cast—and occasional banging on the set to provide some percussion—to carry the show’s musical numbers. This works incredibly well, since the cast has a fantastic vocal range that creates a captivating harmony.</p><p>The set resembles a New York City subway (though not any particular one, as there are signs for multiple stations around the set), with a conveyor belt giving the illusion of a train. Set pieces are moved to replicate other locations like a bar or an apartment. The unique nature of the Circle in the Square Theater, where the audience encircles the stage, provides an immersive experience. No matter where the actors are performing, they are always facing some part of the audience.</p><p>A particularly impressive aspect of the show is the sound effects, which are produced by the cast members themselves. The Boxman, for example, is a street performer who opens the show with impressive beatboxing and perfectly imitates sounds necessary for the story, such as the noises of an approaching train. He also monologues about the spirit of the city and helps other characters with their dilemmas, providing a unifying force for the story.</p><p>The show follows several different but tangentially related New Yorkers, all dealing with some sort of relatable turmoil common to citydwellers. Jane, for instance, wants to get out of her dead-end office job and become an actress, but struggles to land her dream role. Nick is recently unemployed and has to haggle with a subway booth attendant when his MetroCard runs out of cash. Ali recently got out of a bad breakup and suffers lonely Saturday nights, battling the urge to contact her ex over social media.</p><p>Though their stories are separate, they are tied together through distant relationships as their paths cross in the city, leading to developments such as Jane and Nick starting a romance. However, none of these feel contrived and instead accurately portray how despite the city’s busy nature, even if the train being on time is more important to us than a conversation, we can still make some surprising connections with the people we meet.</p><p>The most poignant storyline in the show is that of a same-sex couple, Trent and Steven, played by Justin Guarini and Stuyvesant alumnus Telly Leung (‘98), respectively. We see Trent conflicted when he returns to his hometown for a weekend (introducing Steven as a “roommate”) and faces affection from his family, but also has to sit through sermons where a priest condemns his sexuality as “sodomy.” Steven spends most of the story encouraging Trent to come out to his religious, narrow-minded mother, but Trent, understandably, doesn’t want to lose her love. “This is more important than ever!” Steven tells Trent, trying to convince him to marry him to take a stand against bigotry.</p><p>That line holds a lot of weight in our current political climate, and the scriptwriters are aware of it. In light of both the 2016 elections and Leung’s recent wedding to his own husband, James Babcock, the script was altered to be as relevant as possible. It doesn’t come across as preachy or overly political, but the tasteful way it addresses both those who are openly gay and those struggling to come out accurately represents New York’s diversity.</p><p>The cast is appropriately diverse for an urban setting. Anybody who takes the subway can relate to experiences such as constant train rerouting, people urinating on the walls, and panicking because the MetroCard machine ate your last dollar. Yet it isn’t just the misery of the city that’s explored, but also the glory of its hustle and bustle. One number represents this by blending together the noises of the city (e.g. construction work, deli carts, and MTA officers), featuring an actress in a unique dress made entirely of MetroCards in the center of it all. It’s a small set, but it immerses the audience in the city experience.</p><p>“InTransit” is a love letter to New York. Tourists will be able to relate to the characters and enjoy the music, true, but it’s a must-see for anybody who loves the city, even if they hate some things about it. It celebrates how every stranger has a story, and every story needs the city to thrive. The a cappella stylings are a perfect choice for a musical about New York; like the music in this show being made up of the cast’s voices, the mood of the city is defined by the people within it and all of their wild adventures—even when they come face to face with delays and reroutes.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:54:16.004501	18	1	A review of the Broadway musical InTransit.
325	﻿Under New Head Coach, Pirates Look to Repeat as City Champions	under-new-head-coach-pirates-look-to-repeat-as-city-champions	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>At the end of the 2016-17 season, the Stuyvesant boys’ varsity swimming & diving team had a record of eight wins and zero losses. The team also became the City Champions. This season, they are looking to replicate last year’s performance by defending their title.</p><p>There were only six seniors on the 32-member 2016-17 Pirates team: Brian Chan, Simon Chen, Lawrence Kwong, Joshua Lishnevetsky, Thomas Westfall, and Kevin J. Zheng. This means that this year’s team consists of most of last year’s undefeated team. One new addition, however, is Coach Silvana Choy.</p><p>Choy coached the Stuyvesant boys’ swim team before leaving after the 2006-2007 season. Now, after a 10-year break, she is back. “I am still getting to know the swimmers, but in the short time that I have been coaching them, it is easy to see that they are very hard workers in the pool,” said Choy about her first few days with the team. Usually, teams experience a rocky transition period following the introduction of a new coach, but Choy noted that her transition was quite smooth. “The captains have been very helpful with the coaching transition thus far,” she said.</p><p>To repeat as champions, the Pirates must have a roster of strong swimmers and divers. “I can tell you that the junior class is very strong and I expect great things from Nicholas Wen, Ethan Park, Axel Tolpina, Andrew Chopey, and Sean Roudnitsky. We are also very fortunate to have a diver, [senior] Cody Lin. He is diving beautifully and is going to contribute greatly to our points this season,” Choy said. Choy also commented on the new members of the team. “Two rookies, freshmen Osmond Wan and Tristan Pragnell… are both very talented, and I am excited to have them as part of our team,” she said.</p><p>Though the coach believes that the Pirates have a potent team, they still have powerful rivals to beat if they want to repeat as City Champions. Stuyvesant’s main rivals this season are the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School. “It’s going to be a challenge to defeat Bronx Science in the dual meet season,” Choy said. Last year, the Pirates beat the Wolverines twice, once by a score of 56-38 and the other by a score of 55-47. If the Pirates can beat Bronx Science on Thursday, January 18, they will have a good shot at becoming City Champions.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-22 18:17:07.932508	24	1	The Pirates have a strong roster and a new coach and are trying to accomplish what last year’s team did: go undefeated and become the City Champions.
326	﻿Peglegs Face a Tough Season Following the Graduation of Key Players	peglegs-face-a-tough-season-following-the-graduation-of-key-players	<spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Winter has yet to start, but Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity table tennis team, the Peglegs, is hard at work. The Peglegs have been practicing diligently in anticipation for their games this season. Having been the undefeated Division I League team for the last three years, the team is intent on continuing its winning streak. Their 12-0, 10-0, and 12-0 consecutive records in the past few seasons prove their success.</p><p>However, if the Peglegs are incapable of recuperating from the loss of last year’s seniors, it could bring those high hopes to heel. A worrisome difference between this team and the team of the past three years is the players. Last year’s seniors made up nearly all of the starters, as well as half of the actual team, for all three years that Stuyvesant has dominated the Division I League. The departure of these seniors is, undoubtedly, a huge blow. “The seniors that left the team were the core of our team. They were mentors, key players, and leaders. This year’s team, especially [junior] Katherine [Lee], [senior] Yuki [Lau], and I, have big shoes to fill,” junior and captain Allison Eng said.</p><p>This year, there are virtually no senior players in the starting lineup, with the exception of Lau. Five of the seven starting spots are going to underclassmen. However, Eng believes that this is an advantage in the long run. “One positive aspect is that our team is composed of mostly underclassmen, so even if we don't do as well as we can this year, our team has years to improve,” Eng said.</p><p>The Peglegs have fared well in the past in terms of playoffs, being 2016 PSAL Champions and consistently making semifinals and finals. However, Millennium High School, who beat them out in a close match for a place in finals last year, has become a serious contender. “Our team has honestly been stagnant over the past few years, while other teams [like Millennium] have improved over time… [Millennium’s] first singles player is training to be in the Olympics,” Eng said. A force to the reckoned with, Millennium won the first league game  against the Peglegs 5-0. With a different team dynamic and underclassmen facing the pressure of bringing home the championship without the presence of many experienced upperclassmen, Millennium’s first victory over Stuyvesant may foreshadow a difficult season for the Peglegs.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-22 18:17:46.612303	24	1	
327	﻿Good Fences Make A Good Platform for Activism	good-fences-make-a-good-platform-for-activism	<p>When I asked Jéronimo Covarrubias, a Greenwich Village resident, about his first impression of the giant 37-foot-tall steel cage under the Washington Square Arch, he responded, “I thought it was pretty ordinary. I don’t know. I see new things in this park every day.”</p><p>However, the metal cage, titled “Arch,” is anything but ordinary. It seems to be an obstacle, blocking the passageway under the triumphal arch celebrating the centennial of George Washington’s inauguration. The silhouette of two people embracing is cut out of the center, allowing visitors to walk through a path with mirrored stainless steel on both sides. This is just one of more than 300 installations in Chinese artist Ai Weiwei’s city-wide public art exhibit “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” in place from October 12, 2017 to February 11, 2018.</p><p>The title of the exhibit is a famous line from the Robert Frost poem “Mending Wall,” which analyzes our tendency to put up walls to separate ourselves from other people. It is a form of protection, but it also limits the extent to which we can identify with each other. Ai’s “Fences” deals with exactly this; it is a call for activism in response to the global refugee crisis created by our unwillingness to break down the barriers we have constructed.</p><p>Ai is no stranger to using art as political commentary. His 2010 work “Sunflower Seeds,” an interactive exhibit that covered the entire floor of the Turbine Hall in the Tate Modern art gallery, recalled the hardships suffered during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in China, which took place when Ai was a teenager. Each of the 100 million sunflower seeds was unique on the most micro of levels; each was molded, fired, and hand-painted in Jingdezhen, China, an endeavor that employed 1,600 workers. Standing in the sea of porcelain, the viewer was overwhelmed by the sheer number and depth of the seeds, which represented the Chinese people. Individually, they were small and differed from each other, but united, they could overthrow the Communist regime.</p><p>Ai’s blatant attack on the Chinese government has spurred some opposition. He was placed under house arrest, and his passport was taken away in 2011. However, he continues creating political art. His persistence despite persecution is what makes his work admirable. Though he is no longer subjected to threats of suppression from the Chinese government, his work is a powerful testament to why we need to take action, especially when no one else seems to be doing so.</p><p>Like “Sunflower Seeds,” Ai’s new exhibit depends on human interaction to make meaning out of it. The way we interact with these works is a testament to the way we interact with the ugly issue of the refugee crisis or, as Ai seems to say, our lack of interaction.</p><p>Many of these works are in places that typically don’t attract much attention, such as bus shelters, or, on the other side of the spectrum, places where there are just too many people to stop and ponder about the installation, such as the Doris C. Freedman Plaza in Central Park. The result is a feeling that the installations are almost not there. This sounds counterintuitive, but Ai uses his installation to make commentary on the fact that many of us think the global refugee crisis is important yet still live our daily lives without much thought about what we can do to help those affected by it.</p><p>For many people, the more than 200 lamppost banners Ai has put up throughout the city are easily missed. Each banner is a black and white portrait of a refugee or immigrant. Gridlines have been been cut out of the black vinyl, blurring the outlines of the figures. There is much diversity in the people featured on these posters, from icons such as Nina Simone, a Civil Rights activist and migrant, to the ordinary mothers, fathers, and children Ai met when he was in Iraq. The banners are beautiful and bring humanity to an issue that often has no face.</p><p>In the same vein, “Circle Fence,” a 1,000-foot-long ensemble of nets draped over metal frames around the Unisphere in Flushing-Meadows Corona Park, is often overlooked and underrated. It’s a strange and perplexing sight, but it has come to serve as a jungle gym for children or seating for the general public.</p><p>Thus, there’s this brief moment where most of us think the work is an obstruction, but after that moment’s over, we move on. We think about about it for a second, but then it doesn’t bother us anymore. This is much like our attitudes toward immigration, and Ai does not fail to remind us of it. The refugee crisis infringes upon our normal way of living, but after we ruminate on how it’s terrible and how we wish there was something we could do to make a difference, we forget about it until the next time it’s on the news. We end up not making that difference.</p><p>Ai is especially successful in the placement of his works. There are no mistakes or erratic decisions when it comes to the location of the installations. New York City, synonymous with diversity and immigration, is the most effective setting for the exhibit. This even works on a much smaller level. The choice to place “Circle Fence” around the Unisphere, a landmark of international unity, draws attention to the fact that Corona and Flushing are both neighborhoods that are predominantly immigrant and foreign born.</p><p>Likewise, the placement of “Arch” underneath two marble reliefs of George Washington reminds us that America was founded on the principle of freedom. The form and content of the work interact nicely, as the silhouette of two people embracing echoes Ai’s belief that the basis of our independence, which Washington is so heavily credited for today, is love and tolerance, not suppression.</p><p>However, Ai makes his most powerful and lasting statement with “Gilded Cage,” a huge enclosure made of turnstiles located at the southeast entrance of Central Park. The glittering metallic paint of the bars evokes the sensation of being locked in a luxurious prison. By placing the installation just four blocks from Trump Tower, Ai accuses Donald Trump, an avid supporter of walls who recently passed a travel ban on six Muslim countries, of being locked in his own gilded cage. This is a powerful statement to make, especially when xenophobia and nativism in the United States seem to be as common as skyscrapers in the city of New York.</p><p>There are many opportunities to react with hate and bigotry, but there are just as many opportunities to respond with kindness and acceptance. This idea harkens back to “Sunflower Seeds”—if these small, individually insignificant things are considered in their full magnitude, there may one day be a world where walls are torn down rather than fortified.</p><p>In this way, Ai effectively uses his art as a platform for activism. After contemplating the hidden meaning of “Arch,” Covarrubias admitted, “It definitely changes my thoughts about [the installation]. I want to be able to do something. I want to be able to help.” “Fences” compels us to get involved instead of simply sitting on the net.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 16:14:51.810122	4	1	Ai Weiwei’s new public art exhibit “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors” is a response to the global refugee crisis and encourages the viewer to get involved instead of passively sitting on the sidelines.
329	﻿Jackie Chan Seems Like “The Foreigner” in His Own Film	jackie-chan-seems-like-the-foreigner-in-his-own-film	<p>As a kid, I remember sitting right in front of the television, awe-struck by the sight of Jackie Chan beating up bad guys with little effort in “The Spy Next Door” (2010) as I tried to imitate his every punch and kick. I also remember collapsing after five push-ups in the Fitness Gram that same year. Needless to say, my dreams of becoming the next martial arts warrior never came to fruition. Seven years later, 63-year-old Jackie Chan is still more physically active than me and is taking his career into a new direction with a rare dramatic role in “The Foreigner.”</p><p>“The Foreigner,” directed by Martin Campbell and based off of the novel “The Chinaman” by Stephen Leather, is an action thriller film following Ngoc Minh Quan (Jackie Chan), who seeks revenge upon the death of his teenage daughter during a London bombing by an Irish terrorist group named the “Authentic IRA.” He becomes obsessed with Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), an Irish government official and former IRA member, who he believes to know the perpetrators, resulting in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse.</p><p>On paper, the premise of the movie seems interesting enough, especially with Campbell and Brosnan working together once again after their past success with 1995 James Bond film “GoldenEye.” The film is not lacking in terms of action, with exhilarating scenes of Quan detonating bombs and fleeing from hitmen on roofs.</p><p>Yet, plotwise, the film is messy overall and overly complex, sloppily forcing two stories into one. While the beginning shows potential, Quan’s compelling quest for vengeance becomes cast aside as he hides in the woods for half of the movie, seemingly forgotten in favor of the much more confusing political side . After being threatened by Quan and his superiors, Hennessy is forced to identify the rogue agents, who are also being hunted by the British police. But with so many minor characters and subplots—one of them bizarrely being an incestual relationship of all things—the story just becomes convoluted and hard to follow.</p><p>However, “The Foreigner” manages to be saved from total mediocrity by the intense performances of Brosnan and Chan.</p><p>Brosnan, who is arguably the true protagonist in the film, plays the role of corrupt cold-blooded antihero Hennessy well. As his plans to identify the IRA and stop Quan continue to be foiled and the pressure on him by his superiors and the British police steadily increases over the course of the movie, the cracks in his façade as the cocky, poised government official at the beginning of the movie evidently become larger and larger. He becomes paranoid and ruthless, even shooting a terrorist in the legs until he leaks information.</p><p>And though Chan gets very few chances to shine, he impresses in each, shedding his typically easygoing, humorous self for the role of an empty father with nothing to lose. One of his most emotional scenes depicts him bloodied and surrounded in smoke, desperately searching for his daughter and then clutching her body, sobbing.</p><p>Even more spectacular to watch are the occasional showdowns between Quan and Hennessy. Chan and Brosnan evidently share great chemistry, as Chan’s cold, subtle demeanor is complemented well by Brosnan’s fiery, intense performance. One such face off has Quan with a blank expression on his face, calmly pointing a gun at an angry and panicking Hennessy.</p><p>It’s a shame the film lets Chan down, as his absence causes his character to seem very irrational and slightly more unsympathetic. He spends the majority of the movie threatening Hennessy and his men, who make it clear several times that they do not know who is responsible for his daughter’s death. It’s difficult to root for Chan when his character keeps antagonizing people for no real reason.</p><p>Yet, while the plot of “The Foreigner” may have been a disappointment, Chan’s stellar performance shows that the actor is just as versed in serious roles as in his standard comedic ones. And with obviously no plans to retire soon, perhaps Chan’s future dramatic works will finally live up to the actor’s name.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 16:53:25.161095	13	1	“The Foreigner” disappoints with a convoluted story and a lack of Jackie Chan.
333	﻿Democratic Tide...Not So Much	democratic-tide-not-so-much	<p>Many of my liberal friends were satisfied by the recent string of victories for democratic candidates in the Virginia and New Jersey governors’ races. While it was certainly tempting for them to jump on these results as a rejection of Trump and predict trouble for Republicans in the midterms, this was not the strong rejection of conservatism that my liberal friends had been hoping for.</p><p>The result in Virginia was certainly surprising to most. After all, the Republican nominee, Ed Gillespie, made a climb in the polls before Election Day to only three points behind. He had only lost in Virginia in the 2014 Senate Race by 0.8 percent, with worse showings in the polling. In addition, a week before the election, the Latino Victory Fund ad painted Ed Gillespie supporters as predators to minorities. Many people, myself included, expected this to only further damage the Northam campaign and rally support toward Gillespie. After all, this is what happened to Trump after Clinton characterized half of his supporters as “deplorables.” These factors led me to believe that Gillespie had a good chance of winning in a blue-leaning state. This turned out to be massively wrong, as Democrat Ralph Northam won a convincing nine point victory over Gillespie, larger than Clinton’s margin of victory over Trump in Virginia last year.</p><p>Part of Northam’s unexpectedly large margin of victory can be attributed to his shift to the right as Election Day approached. He said on the campaign trail that he would not allow any cities in Virginia to pursue a sanctuary city policy of not enforcing the law and allowing illegal immigrants to stay in their city. This move to the right probably helped him shift the vote totals in Virginia Beach, his hometown and a largely veteran and typically Republican area, in his favor. The other two races for Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General were won by a five point and seven point margin by the Democrats, respectively. These results were both significantly lower than the governor’s race, showing that Northam was a strong candidate.</p><p>Another surprise was how much the Democrats exaggerated their success in the Virginia House of Delegates elections. While a 15-seat change from Republican to Democrat is certainly significant, 14 of the 15 districts voted for Clinton in 2016 (Trump won the district that didn’t by a mere 0.5 percent). In addition, the average margin of victory in the 15 districts that flipped to Democrats was 9.44 percent compared to Clinton’s 11.76 percent in 2016. Clinton’s election was supposed to be an example of a poor result by a Democrat, and the Democrats couldn’t even outperform that.</p><p>Many may look at these results and wonder how these fairly Democratic districts had Republican representatives for such a long time. The answer is that the Republicans tended to vote in the down-ballot races far more often, which is why they have consistently had a majority in the state legislatures in Virginia and throughout the country. The main takeaway from the recent Virginia election should be that Republicans can no longer be dependent on down-ballot success in the future as Democrats are starting to vote down-ballot more often. This means that the Republicans likely won’t be as dominant in statewide elections as during the Obama years, where they won 33 of 50 governorships and controlled both legislatures in a whopping 32 states.</p><p>In New Jersey, Republican Kim Guadagno performed very well given the circumstances. She was running in a solidly blue state, and as the Lieutenant Governor during Chris Christie’s administration, she suffered from his abysmal 14 percent approval rating. The fact that she lost by a slightly smaller margin than Trump did in New Jersey given the impossibly tough circumstances of her campaign is an impressive achievement.</p><p>While these elections have been hyper-inflated by Democrats to boost their party’s morale, Republicans cannot treat these elections as if nothing happened. After all, the GOP base didn’t show the same enthusiasm that it did in the Obama years, and that really showed in the down-ballot races. Imagine a scenario in which the GOP gets neither tax cuts nor the repeal of Obamacare passed by midterms next year. Combine that with an increasingly energized resistance movement within the Democratic Party and less enthusiasm in the Republican Party. If the House continues to pass bills at a faster pace than all three previous administrations, it may be immune to more conservative primary challengers and barely lose seats.</p><p>The more likely scenario under those circumstances is that voters will become tired of the lack of action by Republican congressmen and the Republicans lose control of the House. These elections are not a sign of the party’s collapse, nor are they nearly as optimistic for Democrats as advertised. However, they should galvanize Republicans to pass legislation to increase their majority in the Senate and maintain their majority in the House.</p>	108	7	\N	2017-12-20 22:57:55.149	2017-12-23 17:01:31.352053	2	1	
335	﻿2017 SING! Charter Amendments	2017-sing-charter-amendments	<p>“We worked with a deadline this year, but it wasn’t implemented into the charter. It worked really well this year. As far as I know, no one went over budget for the first time ever, so we decided to make it official.” — Winston Venderbush, senior</p><p>As the 2017 SING! season came to an end, various changes were made to the SING! charter during a Student Union (SU) Cabinet Meeting on March 23. New rules regarding the fundraising process, caucus involvement, score assignment, and use of music have been established, which will be applied in the next SING! season.</p><p>At SU Cabinet Meetings, SU Vice President Tahseen Chowdhury, voting members of the SU Executive Council, which include the caucuses, a Big Sib Chair, an Editor-in-chief of The Spectator, and a member of ARISTA’s Executive Council have the ability to vote on all matters that are proposed. However, The Spectator abstains from voting and SU President Matthew So has vetoing privileges.</p><p>Every year, a monthly meeting is dedicated to examining the SING! charter. Prior to this meeting, SING! coordinators meet with Chowdhury, So, and Coordinator of Student Affairs (COSA) Matthew Polazzo to discuss any amendments they feel are necessary.</p><p>“The coordinators, as their last act, always look at the SING! charter to make minor tweaks. This is something that happens every year and this is how we solve any problems that may arise,” Polazzo said.</p><p>This year, one of the amendments made to the charter was a limit on the amount of money each SING! grade can raise outside of the SU and through student dues. The maximum amount is now $500, and if a grade were to raise more than this allocated amount, their SING! would be penalized with a one point score deduction for every dollar spent outside of their budget.</p><p>Previously, the charter did not limit the amount of external revenue raised. “The idea is that we want to incentivize the SING!’s to go out and fundraise, but we don't want somebody to be able to write a check for $10,000,” Polazzo said.</p><p>The regulation of the budget also applies to the reimbursement of students. “Even if one decided to spend their own money on SING! and [doesn’t] ask for a reimbursement, points will still be taken off once they exceed the extra fundraising limit,” Senior SING! 2017 coordinator Winston Venderbush said.</p><p>However, some believe these changes will still allow much of the same behavior to occur because there is no one who can oversee each SING!’s budget to this extent. “The budget doesn’t mean anything if you just have somebody who has the funds to spend money on the SING! without worrying about reimbursement,” junior Ray Jones said.</p><p>New rules regarding when spending has to be reported on were also introduced into the charter. The specific deadline will be set by the SU President and the SING! coordinators. “We worked with a deadline this year, but it wasn’t implemented into the charter,” Venderbush said. “It worked really well this year. As far as I know, no one went over budget for the first time, so we decided to make it official.”</p><p>Another amendment to the charter is that caucus members who wish to be a crew director, assistant director, or writer in SING! will no longer be allowed to choose producer roles. This is the case because the SU and the COSA felt that, once chosen, producers would feel obligated to select caucus members who had supported them throughout the process.</p><p>In order to further standardize judging, policies regarding scoring were also instituted into the charter. Judges will now be asked to award integer scores to each SING!. In the past, when some judges scored in decimals and others did not, the SU and the COSA had to compare each SING! on minute differences.</p><p>Additionally, there will be a 15-point score deduction if curtains are held open after one hour’s time. “We had an issue this year with a specific SING! [holding] open the curtains after time was called,” Chowdhury said. “There was no specific rule on re-opening the curtains, so the coordinators decided on a specific point deduction that they agreed was fair. Logically, it was [unfair] to re-open the curtains, but now, we added the rule based on what happened.”</p><p>There will also be a 10-point score deduction if a SING! decides to use a song that has been done in the past two years. The rationale behind this is to encourage each SING! to be distinct from years past.</p><p>Apart from the changes noted in the charter, a SING! technology workshop was introduced by computer science teacher and SING! advisor Yulia Genkina and school aide Trevor DePew this year. Members of the tech crew and the lights and sound crew were required to attend one of three lectures regarding the technical aspects of a SING! production, the intent being to prevent anyone from getting hurt. “The goal is to establish something that everybody can go to so that everybody has the same basic knowledge,” Depew said. “[It made SING!] more efficient and pleasurable.”</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:39:54.555385	1	1	
336	﻿Republican CEO Frank Lavin Speaks to Stuyvesant’s Young Democrats	republican-ceo-frank-lavin-speaks-to-stuyvesant-s-young-democrats	<p>“Lavin said many of the things that the conservatives who produce articles and attend our meetings say, however, people weren't so willing to dismiss someone with as much experience as him so easily.” —Kevin Boodram, junior and president of the Stuyvesant Young Democrats</p><p>Former Republican White House aide Frank Lavin spoke to students in the library on Monday, March 27. The event, hosted by Stuyvesant’s Young Democrats, started with Lavin speaking about his present endeavors as CEO and founder of Export Now. He later discussed his political views on various issues.</p><p>Earlier in his career, Lavin served in the administrations of former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. More recently, Lavin was the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Singapore from 2001 to 2005 and the Under Secretary of International Trade at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2005 to 2007.</p><p>Currently, Lavin focuses on his company Export Now, which helps other companies establish an e-commerce presence in China.</p><p>Social studies teacher Dr. Lisa Greenwald first approached the Young Democrats after reading their newsletter, The Politique, because she noticed that they published pieces by conservatives and liberals. Dr. Greenwald believed her brother-in-law, Lavin, could share an interesting perspective with the members of the club.</p><p>Despite being a long-time Republican, Lavin had announced publicly that he would not support Donald Trump and that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>During his speech, Lavin shared his thoughts about why Trump was able to win the presidency. “[Lavin] described the fact that Clinton felt that, because she was the most educated [and knew] the most facts, [she] would lead people to believe that whatever she said was the morally righteous thing to do and […] the best thing for the country,” junior and president of the Stuyvesant Young Democrats Kevin Boodram said.</p><p>Lavin explained how Trump was different. In his speech, he mentioned that Trump recognized that there was a need for an emotional appeal. Clinton, on the other hand, never met this. During the presidential race, Trump gave the country what Hillary Clinton could not.</p><p>Lavin was asked at the meeting to explain why he did not support Trump, and he explained that his reasons went beyond differing in trade views. “He’s the CEO of a firm that’s all about trading and Trump is very much anti-trade. He was also against Trump for his rhetoric for the things he said against Mexicans, Muslims, and other minorities,” junior Mohammed Sarker said.</p><p>Lavin went on to address the possibility of Trump’s re-election. He discussed his views on what it will take for Trump to get re-elected, explaining how little he needs to accomplish in order to convince the people who voted for him in the 2016 election to vote for him again. “That kind of changed my perspective and made me realize how realistic a second term [for] Trump maybe really is,” Boodram said.</p><p>The Young Democrats were open to hearing different perspectives. “One of the reasons I really wanted him here [was] his experience. In The Politique, we've published writing by conservatives before. There are usually people who refuse to read it, much less internalize it, simply [...] because the author is conservative. Lavin said many of the things that the conservatives who produce articles and attend our meetings say, however, people weren't so willing to dismiss someone with as much experience as him so easily,” Boodram said.</p><p>Lavin greatly changed the perspectives of many of the 40 students that attended, some of whom were in the club and many others that were not. “We tend to think that all conservatives are racist, misogynistic, wealthy bigots and everything,” Sarker said.</p><p>He was also able to remind the leaders of the Young Democrats of their original guiding principles, specifically viewing situations through an objective lens. “With many Republicans like Lavin putting their country before their party and supporting nominees for other parties, [...] the time is right for Democrats to start doing the same and respond by reaching out and accepting the extended arms of people from all over the political spectrum, not to turn them away with the bigotry that forced them out of the Republican party in the first place,” Boodram said.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:40:03.732046	1	1	A piece about Young Democrats Speaker Frank Lavin, Republican CEO
339	﻿Wellness on the Go	wellness-on-the-go	<p>Every morning, set up in front of the senior bar, is a crowd of people busily handing out white paper bags full of breakfast to sleepy and late Stuyvesant students. Called Breakfast on the Go, it is an initiative led by the Wellness Council.</p><p>The Wellness Council was created by seniors Vanna Mavromatis, Hasan Tukhtamishev, and Nicole Cheng, during their sophomore year, from the suggestion and with the encouragement of physical education teacher Dr. Anna Markova.</p><p>They wanted to educate their peers about health awareness and offer services, like that of Breakfast on the Go, to encourage students to care more about their lifestyle choices. “We tend to ignore our health and prioritize basically everything else above it,” Mavromatis said. “We wanted to try and help Stuy students make little, healthy changes here and there that would hopefully add up, at least a little, in the long run to combat specific health issues.”</p><p>Sleep deprivation was one of the first problems they wanted to address. However, early on, the leaders recognized that fixing the all-nighter culture at Stuyvesant was going to be difficult. “We knew we couldn’t make a dent in that regard, because we can’t monitor the students at home or force sleep on them,” Mavromatis said.</p><p>The next logical step was relieving the general stress levels. “Stress,” Mavromatis explained, “can lead to a myriad of health issues, especially in the long run.” Although she believes that the administration is at least partly a contributor to these high stress levels, it’s also a natural byproduct of the environment.</p><p>“If you put a bunch of high achieving kids in a competitive, work intense environment, of course it’s going to end in students neglecting their health,” she said. Their goal was to make some healthier options more convenient. She believes that the administration has been helpful in executing this goal, because they also want the same for the students.</p><p>“Although we didn’t have very many specific details in mind at the very beginning, just a general idea and hope, our plan from there was basically promoting fun, healthy events,” Mavromatis said.</p><p>The one event they wanted to do from the beginning was Duct Tape a Teacher, which they held in the annual health fair last year. Partnered with the Stuyvesant Red Cross, the health fair is an annual school-wide event where booths are set up to promote healthy diets and healthy exercise routines.</p><p>Last year, they also collaborated with the Stuyvesant Environmental Club to hand out blue wellness bottles to all students during homeroom.</p><p>“What we then noticed is that a lot of students tend to neglect their nutritional needs, such as skipping lunch to study or not eating breakfast because of a lack of time,” Mavromatis said. “This was also something we wanted to impact.”</p><p>Thus, they began Breakfast on the Go, a new initiative started this January and designed for students who came in at 7:50 or later to grab breakfast and still make it to class on time. Every morning, the cafeteria provides them with fifty breakfasts.</p><p>The Wellness Council also works with the cafeteria staff to set up. If people want breakfast, all they have to do is give them the ID, so they can record that they actually got breakfast. “We start handing out breakfast at 7:50, just because it’s only for people who are late to school,” sophomore and President Jerry Ye explained.“Other students can just head up to the cafeteria, so we wouldn’t want to waste some of the food downstairs.” They end around 8:05 and then clean up.</p><p>“Pretty much every day we’ve been doing this, which we’ve been doing for the past two months or so,” Ye continued.“We give out every single breakfast provided to us.”</p><p>Ye’s participation in the Wellness Council is largely accredited to his interest in health and well-being in general. “In seventh grade, I tried really hard to get really healthy and fit,” Ye said. “I guess that’s when I started searching up a lot of [health] articles online.”</p><p>Exploring different health initiatives has been a topic that interested Ye for a while.</p><p>“Based on what I’ve research so far, I think health culture is biased,” Ye said. Compared to the volatile worlds of politics and economics, the actual idea of good health does not shift easily. However, because it is often set aside as a minor priority, more powerful political ideals often taint its interpretation.</p><p>An example he provided was Michelle Obama’s anti-obesity campaign she avidly promoted in 2010. “Originally, it was a campaign against sugar,” Ye explained. “After she started being sponsored by some obviously biased corporations, like Wal-Mart, the campaign changed simply into a campaign for exercise. This is an example of how the corruption in the real world can shift the society’s views for health.”</p><p>Ye believes that this corruption cannot be easily pushed aside. When asked how he sees the purpose of the Wellness Council, Ye simply said, “We stand for wellness initiatives.”</p><p>Wellness, a term repeatedly emphasized in junior health classes, has a meaning that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of simply “being in a state of good health.”</p><p>“Wellness is taking care of your body, so that it can function as well as possible,” Mavromatis explained. “It’s just making sure that when you push yourself, you won’t collapse altogether.”</p><p>It’s important to mention that this does not mean there is a standard health protocol. Ye said, “It’s all about having your body feel better in the long run by properly taking care of it.” Wellness is more personal in that it emphasizes striving towards the highest potential of health that an individual can realistically achieve.</p><p>For instance, having a chronic disease does not automatically make you “unwell.” Different definitions of health may not be applicable to specific individuals, who are only concerned with their own measures of well-being.</p><p>But even so, to achieve this, everyone has to recognize the importance of health and understand how to improve it. This is the Wellness Council’s place in the student body.</p><p>Starting the next school year, Ye has big dreams for the club. “Recently, I’ve been trying to change the Wellness Council,” Ye explained. “I’ve tried to get more members engaged.”</p><p>The Wellness Council is currently a small club, and Mavromatis believes it’s because there was a lack of initiative from the very beginning. “It was often difficult to think of events that students would care about and even more difficult to pull them off,” she said. “But I’m confident that going forward, the club will grow, especially with Jerry at the helm, and now that we’ve built some degree of experience and I guess trustworthiness.”</p><p>She’s right. Ye already has plans. He wants to first separate the club into multiple departments that more people can register for.</p><p>Another idea he has is to start publishing a school-wide health newsletter. Led by the writing department, the newsletter will feature articles that promote well-being and tips for being healthy. “Examples of articles would be nutritious tips. Like, in our society, a large proportion of what we ingest is sugar. It’s way higher than it should be,” Ye said. “Or the idea that fat has been villainized, even though it is not as big of a villain as it may seem. It’s just that corporate markets make them out to be the villain.”</p><p>To have it reach a larger general Stuyvesant community, Ye is considering to either partner up with a school publication or create their own.“My vision for it is to be able to constantly pump out newsletters featuring 3-5 articles each issue,” Ye said.</p><p>With the seniors’ support, Ye is confident that they can turn the Wellness Council’s inactivity around. “We have even more plans for the rest of the school year,” Ye said. “And I’m really looking forward to implementing them.”</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:42:53.245692	3	1	
342	﻿Unnatural History of the Holocene	unnatural-history-of-the-holocene	<p>In June 1884, three Icelanders rowed through the night to a remote, rocky island that was home to the world’s last pair of great auks. Like the dodo, these penguin-like seabirds were largely defenseless against humans, and were doomed by their parental instincts. Their last stand was undignified. Once this pair was located, they were promptly strangled and the single egg they were incubating was crushed. Their story appears to be a running theme of European exploration and the Holocene extinction.</p><p>The Holocene is the sixth great extinction. The five previous ones were caused by natural changes, such as increased oxygen in the atmosphere, lower temperatures, or volcanic activity, but this one rests squarely on the relatively young shoulders of humanity. The current extinction rate is an estimated 140,000 species a year, which is 10 to 100 times the average for an extinction event and 10,000 times greater than the baseline rate. This is the greatest loss of biodiversity since the Cretaceous-Paleogene event that infamously wiped out the dinosaurs.</p><p>When we look back at our collective past, we see a pattern of wiping out entire species one after another out of greed and shortsightedness. When we look forward to our collective future, it seems to be only getting worse. Extinction carries with it a sense of finality and a permanent loss to the diversity of our planet. Thus, when scientists announced it was theoretically possible to bring back extinct species, many jumped at the chance for us to redeem ourselves. But the story isn’t as simple as just cobbling together another mammoth.</p><p>In 2009, researchers produced an animal from an extinct species. A newborn Pyrenean ibex born from a surrogate mother lived for seven minutes before dying due to deformed lungs. With her death, the Pyrenean ibex was extinct again. Other attempts have proved that bringing back a species is difficult, but far from impossible. Samples of skin from museum specimens and “frozen zoos” of cells collected from the last member of a species could provide the necessary genetic material. Costs are likely to be high, but they would likely rapidly go down once progress begins because of improvements in biotechnology (similar to the Human Genome project). Despite de-extinction being possible, it may not be the best option.</p><p>At best, de-extinction is likely to waste resources that could be better spent on existing species. At worst, de-extinction could cause more problems than it solves. To be successful, researchers must bring back large enough numbers of extinct species so they could survive in the wild, and maintain enough habitat for them to not become extinct again (which may be harder than species revival). Other issues include reintroduced extinct species becoming invasive, poaching due to their rarity, and disturbing the existing ecological balance.</p><p>Currently, the question of if we should do it is a bigger issue than how. Since many extant species are also at risk of extinction, conservationists argue that the resources would be better spent on ensuring their continued survival, and that biotechnology could be used to help existing species whose numbers have been devastated to regain genetic diversity (such as with cheetahs and northern white rhinos). We have undoubtedly lost countless species before we have even discovered them; the gastric brooding frog went extinct the same year it was discovered.</p><p>We are losing species at a faster rate than we could possibly bring them back. De-extinction would not change the underlying issues of pollution, habitat loss, and human introduction of invasive species and disease that cause extinction in the first place. By putting resources into conservation and directly addressing these problems, we can save far more than one or two extinct species.</p><p>While successfully bringing back an extinct species may be an inspiring display of how far science has come and reveal new information about extinct species, there are still many undiscovered species that will go extinct before we ever discover them if our efforts are in de-extinction rather than conservation. Today, conservationists tote guns and risk their lives to protect the dwindling African elephant population. We do not have the luxury to pour resources into bringing back a mammoth. We are an unnatural disaster and may soon fall prey to ourselves unless we change course.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:44:49.169059	2	1	
347	﻿ICP Review: Perpetual Revolution	icp-review-perpetual-revolution	<p>Many of the people of our generation are painfully unaware of important current events, both domestic and international. Though there are many factors that contribute to this, one problem is that there is no engaging way to get the younger generation invested in these important problems. Most of the news that people consume on a daily basis isn’t all that interesting. It tends to go in one ear and out the other. However, the “Perpetual Revolution: Image and Social Change” exhibit at the International Center of Photography is something completely different. It will leave you feeling completely “shook,” using powerful imagery to bring some of the world’s most glaring problems to life.</p><p>The International Center of Photography is renowned as one of the leading centers for photography and features exhibits that demonstrate the power that photos and videos have in shaping the modern world. “Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,” curated by Carol Squiers and Cynthia Young, opened on January 27, 2017, and will run until May 7. Tickets are $10 for students, and it is located at 250 Bowery in Manhattan.</p><p>The scope of this exhibit is so large that it almost seems impossible to grasp upon first glance. It covers some incredibly important and pressing issues of the modern age: climate change, the refugee crisis, LGBTQ+ representation/treatment, #blacklivesmatter, islamophobia, and the far-right fringe. This incredibly diverse range of topics gives the viewer a sense of overload which only adds to the emotional and intellectual gravitas of the exhibit. However, the sheer volume also impairs the viewer’s capability of ingesting and retaining all of the incredible work that is deserving of his or her full attention.</p><p>After you buy your ticket ($10 not wasted), you open the door and are greeted with a large wall filled with text. This concise, well-written introduction to the entire exhibit describes the importance of truth (or lack thereof) in the modern age and unpacks what it means to be “correct,” especially in a world with “alternative facts” and “post-truth-ism.”</p><p>The room is rather dim and cool, and it seems a bit cold and detached, rather than being warm and inviting. This visual aesthetic works to the exhibit’s advantage, however, as it emphasizes the gravity of the topics discussed and leaves no time to be comfortable with these situations.</p><p>One of the central parts of the exhibits pertains to the refugee crisis. This section of the exhibit is one of the most diverse in terms of media. The centerpiece of this section is a table with some white sand on top of it. It seems very strange at first, but when you see the projector displaying powerful images of the refugee crisis onto the sand, it starts to make sense. You can manipulate the sand in whatever way you’d like to distort the images projected on it. It highlights the fact that refugees are everyday people who led normal lives prior to their displacement. This piece shows the magnitude and spread of the crisis and how it affects so many people around the world. The moldable sand is very symbolic of the fact that we have the power to mold and shape our own world.</p><p>The photography of this section is magnificent and the tension and pain that is captured is stunning. Each picture encapsulates so much action: the rawest and purest forms of human emotion. There is also an e-book available to read as part of the exhibit, along with a slideshow of five incredible photos broken up into nine panels. Although all of the different media make the exhibit seem a bit scattered, it works brilliantly, with everything linking together and the concepts cohesive and powerful.</p><p>As you walk downstairs, you enter the section on LGBTQ+ treatment and representation. This section of the exhibit is almost completely dominated by screens, which is one of the few things that I am not a fan of. The number of screens makes it a bit too much to take in.</p><p>Screenshots of activism on social media, old music videos, pictures of the LGBTQ+ community before their rights were granted, and modern day examples of the community being ostracized dominate this section, and to great effect. The differences in time period serve as a critical reminder to the public that despite the progress that has been made, there is still so much work to be done and still so many parallels between the past and the present in terms of the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community. This section is also a lot more free-flowing than the rest of the exhibit. This part of the exhibit is very “loud” as it is plainly sexual, and it moves in a much less somber manner.</p><p>The most powerful and well crafted part of this exhibit pertains to #blacklivesmatter. The room is painted completely black and is dimly lit, with one wall used as a screen for two incredible collections of footage. One side of the wall displays photographs of the black community of the USA from all different time periods. These pictures are full of striking juxtapositions that make them shine as proof of the struggles the black community has faced.</p><p>The videos shown on the wall are simply amazing. They are composed of both footage from protests and politically charged pop culture. The way that these videos are put together is astonishing. The videos link seamlessly, all circling back to the central point of the struggles faced by the black community. The issues that it addresses are disheartening, yet also empowering. The way the story is told makes you want to do something to make a difference. There was no holding back in the creation of this much needed wake up call.</p><p>The last, and perhaps the least expected section of this exhibit, discusses the far-right fringe, in a very peculiar, yet effective way. How do they tell us about the horrors of these neo-Nazi, fascist edgelords? Through memes. The memes are all related to downplaying liberalism and how “politically correct” people need to be “gassed,” all the while laced with plenty of expletives. It’s an unconventional way to communicate such serious and scary ideas, but it works brilliantly, as memes are something that almost all can relate to, and seeing them used in such a politically charged way really demonstrates a new age of poking fun at the unlaughable.</p><p>After viewing this entire exhibit, you’ll feel a bit tired. You’ll also feel a bit scared for the world. But perhaps most importantly, you will feel hopeful. Hopeful at the fact that people took the time out of their lives to put together such a vast, powerful exhibit to educate others about the horrors of the world and what we can do to respect and change them. And hopeful because people take the time out of their lives to visit and appreciate it. The technique that is used here, throwing everything at the viewer so it feels inescapable, almost suffering, is used to great effect here.</p><p>Especially in a time of great political tension, everyone deserves to be, and needs to be, updated when it comes to current events. With politics becoming more and more relevant in our daily lives and as young people who will eventually inherit this earth, it is our responsibility to not turn a blind eye to the current state of affairs. Young people must take these important matters into their own hands and educate themselves about the world that they will be responsible for.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:48:18.073286	4	1	A review of ICP’s new exhibit
349	﻿Fitter, Happier, More Innovative…  The Legacy of Radiohead’s “OK Computer”	fitter-happier-more-innovative-the-legacy-of-radiohead-s-ok-computer	<p>Albums such as Radiohead’s landmark “OK Computer” (1997), which celebrates its 20th anniversary this May, are released only once in a generation. “OK Computer” challenged listeners to consider popular music not merely as a form of entertainment, but more importantly as a culturally relevant medium of art and philosophy. Its most definitive aspect is its driving pathos, which appeals to the deepest emotions of the listener and forces the audience to reconsider the nature of the world that we live in.</p><p>While “OK Computer” is remembered 20 years after its release for its relevant themes and prophetic social commentaries, it shook the music industry at the time with its maverick spirit—its defiance of the music industry’s norms and ventures into uncharted territories.</p><p>“OK Computer” was a notable departure from the ‘90s alternative rock scene spearheaded by the emergence of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Alice in Chains. Alternative rock of the ‘90s was “alternative” in the sense that it primarily embodied anger, violence, and self-destructive habits. It was also associated with sex, drugs, and alcohol, all of which represented a thrilling escape from a mundane livelihood and came to define the rebellious culture of Generation Y.</p><p>Radiohead first burst through mainstream commercial success with their hit single “Creep” (1991), which remains one of the band’s most well-known songs today. Their second album, “The Bends” (1995), was also well received by audiences. The vocal range of lead singer Thom Yorke and the dexterity of guitarist Jonny Greenwood gained recognition in the alternative rock community. However, their early works were thematically clichéd, simply structured, and driven by a minimalistic sound. Radiohead’s early works failed to break any new ground within an increasingly stale genre.</p><p>The band’s sudden transition into the experimental “OK Computer” was initially perceived by its producer and record label to be “commercial suicide” due to the album’s lack of radio-friendly tracks.WIth respect to “The Bends,” “OK Computer” was much more difficult for listeners to digest. It sacrificed marketability and appeal for the lowest common denominator through its often contradictory and dichotomous nature. It is simultaneously soothing and terrifying, balancing between chaos and calm.</p><p>Rather than appealing to an audience that readily consumed the agonized lyrics of Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley, Radiohead’s “OK Computer” took a different approach by striving to be unorthodox—musically, lyrically, and thematically.</p><p>“Karma Police” is a standout track that showcases the band’s unique brand of experimentation with sound. The somber piano chords and soft strumming of the background acoustic guitar harmonize to establish a deceptively lulling tone, which conceals the sinister themes of the song. Yorke’s distressed vocal timbres in the final verse, “For a minute there, I lost myself,” are accompanied by frantically paced piano segments. These combine to strike a particular chord with the listener by channeling the narrator’s torment into audible sounds. The source of this torment is the “karma police,” the namesake of the song’s title.</p><p>The leading single, “Paranoid Android,” is particularly notable for its rapid transitions between sharply contrasting sections and changes in key. The chorus, “What’s this? / (I may be paranoid but not an android),” is accompanied by multiple guitars and synths, adding on to Yorke’s extended vocal notes. The song builds up to a dizzying crescendo, culminating with Greenwood’s frantic guitar solo, and a sudden decrescendo into a dissonant verse. These transitions then leave the listener unsettled by Yorke’s anguished singing.</p><p>“Fitter Happier,” the album’s most anomalous track and most difficult listen, incorporates a computer text generated voice to paint a picture of an ideal society in the future. Dissonant and jarring piano chords have an unpleasant effect on the listener and accompany the computerized narrating voice, which lists in rapid succession unreasonable expectations for both personal and societal progress. Such expectations of the narrator include “Sleeping well, no bad dreams, no paranoia / No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows / Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate.”</p><p>The seemingly positive lyrics are instantly stripped of their deceptive facade as the song’s ominous and discomforting sound takes a more looming presence. The clashing piano, strings, and electronic instruments all convey an atmosphere of despair and false hope through irregular time signatures and asymmetric sections. The hidden overarching theme present in “Fitter Happier” is a society driven by consumerism and advertisements. Much of the song portrays an ideal lifestyle—a society preoccupied with “eating well,” “not drinking too much,” and “a safer car”—while being oblivious to the fact that there is “no chance of escape” from the rituals and routines they have been accustomed to.</p><p>In addition to exploring new realms of sound, the album also delves into several criticisms of modern society by depicting lives corroded by technology. The opening track “Airbag” is about a narrator surviving a car crash and walking out of the experience as a changed man: “In a fast German car / I’m amazed I survived / An airbag saved my life.” These lyrics emphasize the fragility of our lives which are at the mercy of technology, foreshadowing the unprecedented role that technology has in our lives today in the 21st century. The narrator also expresses a newfound thrill to be alive—an adrenaline rush from surviving a lifestyle of breakneck speed.</p><p>Shortly after the release of “OK Computer,” the music industry took off in a completely different direction, with many pop artists rising to the top of the BIllboard charts, only to fizzle a few weeks later. This profit-driven system of cashing in on the latest trends encouraged artists to release hot, catchy singles at the expense of taking the time to craft an entire album. The band members of Radiohead were pressed with a demanding deadline for “OK Computer,” and much of their frustration was voiced while creating the album. By the late ‘90s, the band witnessed the rapid rise of the World Wide Web, the advent of cellphones, and the increasing prevalence of mass media in everyday life.</p><p>Yorke attributes the fast-paced lifestyle depicted in “Airbag” to people’s diminishing attention span and need for instant gratification—the notion that faster is always better. In defiance, “OK Computer” was designed to be a lengthy hour-long album, devoid of pop friendly tracks and with little marketability. Radiohead was more intent on channeling their frustrations of modern society rather than appeasing their listeners. They were ultimately aware of the troubling direction that popular music was heading toward.</p><p>While the album encompasses a multitude of themes throughout, it is essentially a scathing commentary on human nature and its inherent ignorance. The narrator’s plea for self-validation in “Paranoid Android” (“You don’t remember / Why don’t you remember my name?”) expresses the crushing reality in which society has become a monolith that drives out any form of creativity and promotes dullness. The society depicted by “OK Computer” believes that “It’s always better when the light is off / It’s always better on the outside” (From the track “Climbing Up the Walls”).</p><p>“OK Computer” completely upended the definition of “alternative music” and delved into thematicism and experimentation like no other musicians have done before. The album’s insistent defiance of the music industry’s norms have set a new precedent for other artists across all different genres to follow. Ultimately, its intentions were to have a profound effect on the listeners and to both captivate and provoke them. Despite the troubling and perhaps prophetic depiction of modern society in the 21st century, the album reassures its listeners to “Breathe, keep breathing / Don’t lose your nerve” (From “Exit Music For a Film”).</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:51:37.869286	16	1	
350	﻿Drake Takes Diversity in Music to a New Level in “More Life”	drake-takes-diversity-in-music-to-a-new-level-in-more-life	<p>Drake has always been one to impress his listeners with his genuine artistry in music. When he released his groundbreaking album, “Views,” in April of 2016, he set the music world into a frenzy. Less than a year later, Drake has stunned the music world again with his recent debut of “More Life.” This project, whose release has been awaited by his fans since its announcement on Drake’s birthday, features a lengthy total of 22 tracks and spans 81 minutes. Interestingly, rather than being officially called an album (like “Views”), Drake dubs “More Life” a playlist.</p><p>Though this has proved an unprecedented decision in music and confused many critics initially, the motives behind this tactic became a little clearer after listening to the entire album. Had “More Life” been called an album, the style would have been seen as all too similar to “Views,” but yet not nearly as good or fleshed out. Both span exactly 81 minutes long, are presented in a versatile style (predominantly hip-hop that mixes in pop and R&B), feature Drake singing about his past struggles, and exhibit his heavy usage of samples.</p><p>This distinction of a playlist is what allows critics and fans alike to take what Drake has produced more lightly. An album, especially if it is a Drake album, comes with the expectation of having only the most innovative and record-breaking tracks, something “More Life” unfortunately falls short on. However, for Drake, this playlist serves as a perfect intermediate between “Views” and his upcoming album, allowing his fan base to be occupied with more music.</p><p>Listening to the entire playlist for the first time in one full sitting, I wasn’t able to sense a strong artistic statement from Drake. It is on the passive side and feels too much under-the-radar. There are many diverse, beautiful, and unique ideas presented throughout this playlist, but this eclectic compilation of different styles is woven and developed in a fashion that prevents it from being as sonically cohesive as it could be.</p><p>Part of this lack of presence stems from the fact that he does not have a clear and direct direction that he wants to take with “More Life.” The first two tracks, “Free Smoke” and “No Long Talk,” both contain heavier beats to which Drake raps.</p><p>After the first two tracks, the playlist immediately goes into “Passionfruit,” a track that provides a surprisingly pleasant contrast and appears to be everybody’s favorite. “Passionfruit” features a deep Caribbean and Jamaican sound, consisting of a pulsating, dance-like rhythm that pervades the entirety of the song. It also uses modern synthesizers and other light percussion instruments to emulate the sound of a steelpan and to create a potent grooving sound, making the track truly enjoyable to listen to. The same style goes on for the next four tracks (“Jorja Interlude,” “Get it Together,” “Madiba Riddim,” and “Blem”) that tie together smoothly as they all contain a lighthearted, dancehall sound. After those four tracks, it progresses right back to hard-hitting music, such as rap and heavy hip-hop for the rest of the playlist.</p><p>Another indicator that Drake takes a backseat in this playlist is that he diverts a lot of the focus onto other singers. In one track titled “4422,” Drake’s vocals are not present at all. Instead, British singer Sampha takes on the spotlight. Sampha sings the entirety of the song, with his voice having a soft, layered chorus effect that helps create a poignant yet intimate feeling. “4422” has the slowest of all tempos on the track, allowing both Sampha’s voice and each element in the cool instrumentals to be distinctly heard and appreciated.</p><p>Drake is also out-sung in one of the most memorable tracks, “Glow,” a highly anticipated collaboration with another hip-hop icon, Kanye West. West takes on the main hook, opening up the song with singing, “Watch out for me / I’m about to glow.” He repeats that several times throughout the song. His dominating vocals are crisp and powerful, which provide the sole focus to this song. Drake does a fairly decent job of singing his verse in the second half, yet it does not match Kanye’s.</p><p>Moreover, the extensive use of samples in “More Life” should be viewed with ambivalence. On one hand, Drake has added many dimensions to this playlist with their clever use. In “Do Not Disturb,” Drake takes the soulful vocals of Snoh Aalegra in her ballad, “TIME,” speeds them up and loops them over and over, creating a beautiful background to set his rap in. Drake also samples songs of different genres from almost every decade in the past five decades. With this, he is truly able to convey a sense of diversity in music.</p><p>However, in “Teenage Fever,” he goes overboard with a sample of Jennifer Lopez. Drake takes the chorus of Jennifer Lopez’s “If You Had My Love” and sets it as his own chorus. Though it works and sounds well, it is a cheap and ingenuine tactic to produce a song.</p><p>The lyricality of this playlist is expected of Drake. He does not fail to deliver a heartfelt message about how far he has come since the beginning: the struggles and sacrifices he has made in his career, his widely-scrutinized romances, fame, and the relationships with the people around him. In “Glow,” we hear the iconic lyrics “Started from the bottom, now we here now,” which directly alludes to his song, “Started From the Bottom” released in 2012. These lyrics have become the epitome of Drake’s portrayal of himself as the underdog who overcame obstacles from his childhood and single-handedly became a success.</p><p>The quality of the instrumentals are a strong suit of this playlist. In many tracks such as “Ice Melts” and “Glow,” they feature subtle hints of trap layered with different kinds of drum beats, and one strong rhythm plays throughout.</p><p>An hour into listening to this playlist, it can feel as if it has dragged on for too long. It is a dense, unfocused album that shines more for its variety of voices and ideas. Yet, it’s definitely worth listening to at least once. Listening to these 22 tracks more and more frequently has made it grow on me, as I’ve gradually come to appreciate the diverse niceties that Drake has presented to the table. It’s not a perfect piece of work and is not Drake’s best by far. But as stated in the outro, until he comes “back in 2018 to give [us] a summary” in the form of  a new album, this playlist proves itself good enough to listen to meanwhile.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:53:02.438721	16	1	Drake dominates the music world once again, but this time in a subtler way with the release of a “playlist.”
351	﻿With Little Mix, Maturity Equals Improvement	with-little-mix-maturity-equals-improvement	<p>Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, and Leigh-Anne Pinnock came together to become the first girl group to ever win The X Factor in 2011. Four albums and many awards later, they have won over thousands of people with their raw talent, flawless harmonies, and endless charm.</p><p>However, an average fan would receive quite a shock when they listen to their most recent album, “Glory Days” (2016).</p><p>In their previous albums, they had shied away from mature topics, doing nothing more than dropping at most a few hints toward something more sexual. But in “Glory Days,” it is clear that Little Mix has taken into account their own maturation as artists, as well as the maturation of their intended demographic from teens to adults.</p><p>In “Glory Days,” Little Mix manages to infuse a variety of musical styles with a creativity exclusive to them alone, from sweet ballads to fun dance jams.</p><p>Their first released single of the album, “Shout Out To My Ex,” is meant to be uplifting and inspiring to those who still haven’t quite gotten over their past lovers breaking their hearts. The accented beats perfectly accentuate the confident lines, with each girl making sure to let the ex know he isn’t needed. Edwards even makes sure to include in her beginning verse an unexpected sassiness: “I hope she gettin’ better sex, hope she ain’t fakin’ it like I did.”</p><p>Although the placement of an acoustic guitar in such a beat-heavy song is odd, it’s precisely what the track needs to tie it all together. The guitar is the perfect accompaniment to the girls harmonizing over the chorus, with lyrics like, “I’m all the way up, I swear you’ll never bring me down.”</p><p>The sound of them singing together and the stripped-down feel we get from the guitar makes the tight bond and unity between all the girls clear, as they help each other rise above their previous breakups.</p><p>“Touch,” their second single, is a passionate declaration of love. It begins soft and slow, with nothing more than Pinnock’s sweet statements of love and a simple background melody. But once the beat drops, the song transforms. The strong beat and perfectly executed harmonies for the catchy chorus make it the perfect song to dance to.</p><p>It is implied that the “touch” of the love they’re receiving isn’t exactly a PG-13 kind of love. Edwards and Thirlwall’s lines include the lyrics, “Fingers on my buttons and now you’re playing, master of anticipation,” while Nelson makes it most evident with “Photograph with no t-shirt on, why you making me wait so long?” The girls knew singing of a more “adult” love would escalate their level of passion, and it just so happened to create the perfect dance song in the process.</p><p>Despite being a pop group, Little Mix successfully incorporates more old-fashioned musical aspects. “F.U.” provides a satisfying, pleasing-to-the-ear throwback to the ‘50s. The girls croon about how they can’t stay mad at their corrupt lover: “Had my break-up speech ready, then you kissed my face, it’s the way you persuade me.”</p><p>It starts off deceptively simple, with a rolling drumbeat and the bluesy strumming of a guitar. Nelson’s distinct, unique vibrato is perfect for introducing the song, followed up by Thirlwall infusing a little bit of grit into her usually smooth vocals.</p><p>They’re more subtle about sexual content here, but its presence is undeniable; when Pinnock belts out the lyrics, “I wish you were dead ‘til you take me to bed, you’re so good, so good,” it’s obvious as to what she’s singing about. Even so, the girls manage to use the perfect combination of a breezy beat and powerful vocals to truly get their message of conflicting feelings of love and hatred across.</p><p>Little Mix does phenomenally when it comes to ballads. “Nobody Like You” is their attempt—a successful one—to top their previous noteworthy ballad “Good Enough.”</p><p>It starts with Nelson accompanied by soft piano. Nelson tones down her rasp for this song in order to showcase more of her soulful vibrato, making her low notes sound raw and emotional. When she showcases her upper register in the second half of the chorus, she truly sounds like she’s almost on the verge of tears as she sings, “I’m screaming ‘I don’t want you’ but you know that I do.”</p><p>The rest of the girls follow up with an equally emotional performance. The piano is slowly joined by other instruments and an intensifying beat while the girls sing their hearts out over the pain inflicted on them after breaking up with someone they truly loved.</p><p>As they sing “I only like myself when I’m with you” and “All I want is to feel again,” instead of each member sounding like a teenager crying over young love, they sound like a woman mourning over a person she loved with all her heart.</p><p>Their most explicit track is definitely “Private Show.” Its heavy bassline and sharp brass notes give the song energy and electricity and make it nearly impossible to stop oneself from dancing along and lip-syncing with the girls.</p><p>Yes, it’s definitely a surprise as to how extreme some of their lyrics are. None of the girls hold back at the chorus, singing, “Who said we got to go slow, turn down the lights and watch my private show” and “To get high, we got to get low.” But it can’t be denied that this is definitely one of their boldest and best tracks to date.</p><p>“Glory Days” is a statement of how bold is better. Some may be put off by how much Little Mix has matured in the time span between their most recent album and this album, preferring their old sound in comparison. But it’s important to understand that artists change. From what we’ve heard, it’s clear that a lack of non-sexual content doesn’t correlate to a lack of quality for Little Mix.</p><p>“Glory Days” is only Little Mix’s transition to maturity. As they continue to “grow up,” their music will only continue to improve.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:53:46.164839	16	1	
415	﻿Rebels Are Down To The Wire Again	rebels-are-down-to-the-wire-again	<p>With two seconds remaining in a suspenseful game against Washington Irving High School and the deficit of just three points, all eyes were on senior Nicholas Kim. Kim had the hot hand from behind the arc, having scored 12 of his 18 points from three-point range, and a three was what the Runnin’ Rebels, Stuyvesant’s boys’ basketball team, needed. Tension in the gym started to build as the Rebels broke their huddle, where coach and guidance counselor Paul Goldsman had drawn up an inbound play in an attempt to get a good look at the basket and send the game into overtime. The scheme worked: as senior Sean Chung looked frantically for the first open teammate he could find, he sent a pass to Kim, as their coach had designed. Despite his wide open opportunity, Kim could not continue his success from beyond the arc; he bobbled Chung’s pass and was unable to get a good shot off, ending the Rebels’ hopes for a thrilling victory. The team was handed its second straight loss by a final score of 46-41 and dropped to 1-7 on the season.</p><p>The game was close out of the gate. Even as the Rebels’ season-long turnover struggles continued, Irving was missing its shots and senior Nicola Manfredi kept them in the game, scoring all seven of his points in the first quarter. “We didn’t move the ball well enough against Irving. However, I think we showed heart by staying in the game when they were physically larger than us,” Manfredi said. This was reflected as the turnovers spilled into the second quarter for the Rebels and they fell into an eight-point hole, but a strong finish spearheaded by Kim—who had begun to heat up from long range—cut the deficit to just four to end the quarter.</p><p>In the third quarter, some strong half-court defense thanks to a shift in strategy by Goldsman helped cut the opponents’ lead to two for some time and keep the Rebels in the game. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to capitalize, as they struggled to convert on the turnovers their strong defense created. Inevitably, turnovers came back to bite them again in conjunction with poor transition defense as the opposition took advantage of plentiful fast breaks. By the end of the quarter, Irving’s lead was at just six points thanks to some weak free throw shooting on its part.</p><p>The fourth quarter is where things really started to get interesting. Initially, Irving looked as if it was going to run away with the game as the team extended their lead to double digits. However, with time dwindling, a Rebel run spurred by strong three-point shooting from Kim sliced the lead down to three. Despite the shift in momentum, the Rebels were not able to close out the game.</p><p>The team finished the eventful month of December with a 1-5 record. The Rebels enjoyed a convincing 18-point away victory against the Norman Thomas Tigers on December 19. Conversely, the team suffered a demoralizing away loss at the hands of a strong Seward Park Campus Bears team.</p><p>Statistically, they have been too concentrated thus far this season. In terms of scoring, Manfredi and Kim led the way with 9.6 and 9.5 points per game, respectively, both placing within the top 15 scorers in the division. Aside from senior Michael Gillow, no other Rebel is averaging more than 4.5 points per game. Similarly, Gillow’s 2.9 assists per game led the team and placed him at 12th in the division, but no other Rebel makes an appearance on the leaderboard like senior Sean Chung, junior Ricky Zou, and Manfredi do in the 20-30 range, averaging just 1.3, 1.1 and one assist, respectively.</p><p>The Rebels have struggled with ball movement, and as they work on it, they are likely to see increases in the assist numbers and distribution of scoring. While the rebounding numbers are better distributed among four players with rebounding totals between 20 and 30, the Rebels are not well represented on the division leaderboard in that statistic. The Rebels hope to play more consistently in the five games they have remaining in the month of January.</p><p>As playoff berth begins to slip out of reach, the team is working to improve each game. “Our goal is still to make playoffs even though it’s a much harder task at this point,” Manfredi said. The Rebels have shown that they can compete with enough of their opposition to make a run for the playoffs. Often, the deficits in their 9-12 point losses were created almost entirely in one quarter while the Rebels played at par or better than the opposition during the rest of the game. If they improve on their ball movement and protection, they can close out games and finish the season strong despite the hole that they’ve dug themselves into. Goldsman is similarly optimistic. “I have seen significant improvements in some of our players and I hope it ultimately leads Stuyvesant to garnering some more victories,” he said. “We have played in many close games, and I believe that if we protect the ball better and make our free throws, those three-point loses can easily became five-point victories.”</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:58:04.409835	2018-01-23 02:58:04.53597	24	1	
416	﻿The NFL Schedule: A Giant Rubik’s Cube	the-nfl-schedule-a-giant-rubik-s-cube	<p>Imagine a Rubik’s cube. When it’s mixed up, it’s difficult to solve for the average person. Now, imagine that certain squares are locked in place, but other squares are meant to coincide with different parts of the cube. The NFL schedule is exactly this: a giant Rubik’s cube with fixed pieces. Two of the people responsible for creating this schedule are Howard Katz, NFL Senior Vice President of Broadcasting and Media, and Michael North, Senior Director of Broadcasting. I recently sat down and spoke with them about how they make the NFL schedule, a technology and math problem that might stump even the best Stuy student.</p><p>Katz and North begin their work on the schedule in January, while the previous NFL season is still going on. It’s a long and arduous process. “There are over 700 trillion possible schedules out there. We’re looking for a needle in a haystack, but the first thing to do is to see if we can find the right haystack,” Katz said.</p><p>He and North use a program which relies on a network of more than 200 computers worldwide. This program has tens of billions of variables, including nearly every possible change that could be made to a schedule. “It’s a combination of math, science, and human input,” Katz said.</p><p>“[We] know the 256 matchups the day the [previous] regular season ends,” North said. For each team, this includes six games against the three other teams in their division (one home and one away), four games against teams from a division in the American Football Conference (AFC), four games against teams from a division in the National Football Conference (NFC), and two games against teams in their conference, which are chosen based on the previous year’s regular season record.</p><p>The NFL uses a set of 30,000 rules, each with a certain number of points attached to them, to determine the usability of their schedule. These rules have points assigned to them, from 1 point (barely consequential) to 999 points (absolutely cannot be broken).</p><p>One major issue with matchups is that they have to fit within a team’s stadium blocks, the days when it is available. “The first thing we do is take all the stadium blocks and put those onto the board to show when you can’t play a game at a stadium,” Katz said. These blocks can range from baseball games (in places like Oakland and Philadelphia), the Chicago Marathon, or even NASCAR.</p><p>Another issue is balancing the schedule between being team-friendly and TV-friendly. “Somewhere between these two extremes, we’re looking for the right shade of gray instead of black or white,” North said. “It’s not even about satisfying [the teams and the networks], it’s about disappointing them, hopefully equally and hopefully not that much.” That is, finding the best possible balance between giving the teams enough rest and making sure the best games get on TV.  “Our job is to make sure that those must-see matchups get into must-see windows,” North said. These must-see windows are the primetime games and the 4:15 - 4:30 start-time games on Sunday. The teams that get into these windows the most are usually the Cowboys, Packers, Patriots, and Steelers, as they have the largest national followings.</p><p>To do so, the NFL employs two methods: flex games and cross-flexing. Flex games are games late in the season that can have their time changed a week in advance, and cross-flexing is switching games between Fox and CBS to ensure that more of the country sees a big game. This usually occurs when a team that was not expected to be good at the beginning of the season becomes a team of national relevance. A recent example was the Los Angeles (LA) Rams. “No one saw the LA Rams coming,” Katz said. This is what led to the week 12 cross-flex of the Saints-Rams game from 1:00 PM ET on Fox to 4:15 PM ET on CBS.</p><p>Not surprisingly, technology has been a game changer in how the NFL is scheduled nowadays. “We’re more sophisticated than we’ve ever been before and our clubs are too,” Katz said. “We’re looking at things we would have never thought about because technology allows us to do that now.” But, even with today’s technology, complex math and human touch are still necessary to solve the Rubik’s Cube made up of tens of billions of variables, 256 matchups, 30,000 rules, and over 700 trillion possible solutions that make up the NFL’s regular season schedule.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:58:52.68239	2018-01-23 03:00:47.764172	25	1	The process behind creating the NFL schedule is very complicated and requires a lot of math, science, and human input.
426	﻿Senior SING!: Fairy Tales are Women’s Tales	senior-sing-fairy-tales-are-women-s-tales	<p>Fairy tales are women’s tales: Sleeping Beauty rescued by the gallant Prince Charming, Snow White’s maternal impulse toward the dwarves, and Cinderella forced to scrub the floors. These stories used to put us to bed at night, teaching young girls that they should strive to become objects of male attention and teaching young boys that every girl is an unambitious damsel in distress.</p><p>With Princess Esme’s (Lizzy Lawrence) strong-willed temperament and Prince Chauncey’s (Michael Holmes) ineptitude, Senior SING!, coordinated by Winston Venderbush with the help of producers Vicky Wu, Maddie Ostergaard, Namra Zulfiqar, and Dina Gomaa, was medieval with a twist, weaving an entirely new women’s tale.</p><p>The audience is immediately made aware of Esme’s predicament: her first queue to speak is cut off by King Bartholomew (Dennis Ronel), her father, whose focus is entirely on Chauncey’s coronation. Continuously silenced and overshadowed, Esme is disgruntled with Chauncey’s nonchalance toward the throne, yet she remains anything but demure or helpless.</p><p>It may not have been a girl sitting in a tower, singing to the birds, but Senior SING! opened up with visions of our childhood. Within a castle on a hill, stained glass reflected light onto golden thrones. With a stunning background and eagle statues, senior art, directed by Yuji Fu, Lauren Moy, Jasmine  Zhang, and Miranda Luong, and senior props, directed by Sydney Dlhopolsky, made us feel like we were in the Kingdom of Wessex.</p><p>The coronation festivities began with a hymn-like rendition of “Some Nights,” as chorus, step, and cast gathered on stage, the sheer number of performers inspiring awe.</p><p>Amidst this flurry of celebration, senior latin, directed by Levy Agaronnik and Joshua Lishnevetsky, sensually materialized before the crowd, hips thrusting and bodies swaying. Their liveliness was pronounced and every movement emboldened with character, making them our favorite crew of the night.</p><p>Following King Bartholomew’s resounding “no” to Esme’s attempt to speak, Yorick the jack-in-the-box (Alec Dai) is brought forth as comedic relief. Taking a drink from Chauncey’s goblet, he collapses back into the box—poisoned.</p><p>“Clear the Senior Atrium!” is shouted across the stage, a reference to antagonisms between the senior class and administration, connecting the otherwise distant theme to Stuyvesant students. From the ensuing stampede emerges senior step, the castle guards, directed by Jason Chen, Samuel So, and Kelly Wang. Between their reverence for senior pride and the reverberations created by each stomp, their unity was on full display. Holding their S-E-N-I-O-R shields high, they ended with a blindingly fast sequence.</p><p>Once again, Esme’s tensions rise to the surface when King Bartholomew focuses his attention entirely on Chauncey. Reminding us of her misplaced anger, Esme remarked condescendingly, “Who would want to kill Chauncey?” This continuous use of foreshadowing gives the script a complexity not seen in years past, creating anticipation amongst the audience for a breaking point in their relationship.</p><p>In an attempt to protect Chauncey, the king calls on the services of Sir Komsyze (Evan Lieberman), a Monty Python-esque knight and sorceress Helloise (Emily Ma), Chauncey’s budding love interest. Far from being stoic bodyguards, this pair lead the siblings on an adventure to find a safe haven, but instead they come across a plague-infested village.</p><p>In the face of this suffering, Esme emphasized that a leader must shoulder the burden of his or her people. Meanwhile, Chauncey cowered at the people’s pain, shattering the traditional association between masculinity and strength or conviction.</p><p>The atmosphere darkened, the air became murky, and the black plague encircled Chauncey. Senior modern, directed by Nadia Filanovsky and Enver Ramadani, began their performance with a haunting execution of “Ring Around the Rosie.” Wilting flower petals fell to the floor as the dancers sought to embody the plague with each eery, coordinated step.</p><p>Donning black silk and green velvet, the powerful figure of Helloise stepped in to save Chauncey, who was overwhelmed by the reality of his subjects’ living conditions. Even supporting female roles, traditionally lacking depth, were able to manifest themselves into positive role models.</p><p>The next obstacle the travellers overcame was a snake pit: senior belly, directed by Shupti Biswas and Sabrina Pirzada. A mix of jazz and blues highlighted their sensuous, undulating torsos, only a small sample of the senior band’s talent, directed by Jean Joun and Sam Lazarev. Somewhat incongruous with last year’s performance, belly lacked male participation.</p><p>When a third obstacle appears, the path to safety threatens to become repetitive and tedious, but senior hip hop, directed by Jian Ting, Muhammad Rivaldo, Nina Uzoigwe, and Tony Zheng, managed to further engage the audience. Dressed as bandits in black, holding knives, and dancing fluidly, performers popped up in the aisles to create an electrifying moment.</p><p>Almost randomly, a dragon then appears in their path. With its four members, senior flow, directed by Wilson Wong and Ayman Ahmed, seemed to lack purpose. Last year, senior flow set the precedent of being much more than floating lights; this year, flow failed to innovate, and unlike the other crews, seemed to be carelessly thrown into the story.</p><p>Completely in character, Chauncey fails to protect himself, and his carelessness pushes Esme to her breaking point; she proclaims it would have been better if he had died.</p><p>Back at the castle, the Royal Family has troubles of its own. After interrogating several quirky characters, Esme becomes their prime suspect when her best friend Priscilla Marie (Lillian Carver) testifies against her. Marie is represented as a gossiping gold digger, and was executed brilliantly. Her nasally voice and frantic body motions lent themselves perfectly to the stereotype.</p><p>Making her first appearance as a developed character, Queen Christiana (Kate Johnston), shocked by this information, performs a heartbreaking medley of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” with the overlapping voice of Esme singing “Back to Black” as she confronts her hateful words toward her brother. Though Junior SING! attempted a similar feat, they were unable to achieve this level of cohesion.</p><p>Finally, our protagonists reached two forks in the road, and we appreciated the pun. Here, Sir Komsyze and Helloise each took different routes, leaving Esme and Chauncey to confront their culminating tensions.</p><p>Esme vented her frustrations: while Chauncey spent his childhood learning to joust, she was taught to dress pretty. The intent of her speech was to have the audience acknowledge how gender roles can be discouraging forces, transforming SING! from a celebration of creativity to a platform for student voices.</p><p>Through a duet of “Halo,” Chauncey and Esme are able to reconcile. As the lights and sound crew, directed by Jonathan Mikhaylov and Lela Ni, placed a simple spotlight on Chauncey and Esme, the audience showed their support with flashlights. Chauncey’s timbre was warm and rich and complemented Esme’s sweeter tones.</p><p>This tender moment is interrupted by a surprising plot twist. Overlooked for the majority of the play, Sir Komsyze stabs Chauncey and reveals that he has successfully framed Esme for this murder. Esme takes a stand by picking up Chauncey’s blade and fighting the trained knight, showing her courage and compassion.</p><p>All night Senior SING! had tip-toed around the fourth wall, and they finally breached it: Lawrence and Lieberman break character and call for stunt doubles. A dramatic fight scene ensues, and Esme emerges victorious. However, her success is short-lived; she is captured and taken to the castle for her execution.</p><p>Confronted with seemingly concrete evidence that his daughter killed his son, King Bartholomew grieves for both of his children through his moving performance of “Hallelujah.” When Esme attempts to explain the situation, she once again is silenced.</p><p>In the final minutes before her execution, Chauncey and Heloise miraculously arrive at the scene and reveal Sir Komsyze’s treachery. Chauncey comes to the realization that Esme understands and cares about the well-being of the kingdom more than he does. He forfeits his crown to Esme, showing the importance of humility and reversing the stereotype of men being best suited for leadership positions; her coronation is a feminist triumph.</p><p>The coronation festivities were born anew, and senior swing, directed by Levy Agaronnik and Joshua Lishnevetsky, excelled just as much as senior latin. Senior SING! seemed to make deliberate decisions that shaped their show, not only as a progressive, but also as a well-crafted story. In an almost cyclical manner, Esme and Chauncey’s long journey begins and ends with the passing of the crown.</p><p>Likewise, Senior SING! was able to incorporate pop culture references that modernized what would have been an archaic fairy tale. Though he was a recurring comedic relief, High Priest (Lowell Weisbord), with his rapping, dancing, and pop culture references, proved to be one of the highlights of the show.</p><p>By the end of the show, Senior SING! solidified the idea that fairy tales are women’s tales. These are the stories our children will grow up hearing: Michelle Obama, Angela Merkel, Sonia Sotamayor, and Queen Esme.</p>	107	12	\N	2017-03-31 22:26:41.889191	2018-01-23 22:26:42.142267	20	1

Obama is more than dearly missed and remains in our hearts forever.</p><p>To fully understand the trajectory of Obama’s life, we have to start from the beginning. A very, extremely, bigly reputable source has long asserted that Obama was born in a small Kenyan village to two devout Muslim, lesbian mothers in the impoverished country of Africa.</p><p>Obama studied by lamplight every night until he fell asleep tangled among his 32 half-siblings, finally writing his way out of his small hut and misery to infiltrate the United States with the sole purpose of becoming its president.</p><p>Obama had his faults—that same reputable source tells us that Obama is solely responsible for the 2008 global recession and that Obama is a race-baiter. But there was something about him: his cheerful disposition would let us know that things were going to get better—no more; now we just cry.</p><p>When Obama departed from our world to the sunny realm of Tahiti, he left a great void behind, a void that would seek to tear apart his very existence. Obama tried to prevail until the very end, but it was just too much for him.</p><p>The majority of us didn’t ask for the fate that came to Obama. But Ohio did.

The opposing pitcher, looking understandably flustered, prepped for the pitch. To his apparent dismay, he was no match for Steinman, and a bloop up the right field line later, the Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity baseball team, had their first lead at 2-0.</p><p>They would ride this momentum to extend their season starting winning streak to three games as they defeated Norman Thomas High School by a final score of 7-2 at Pier 40. “Our bats came alive early and got us going from the start,” senior and co-captain Jack Archer said.</p><p>After taking a 3-0 lead by the end of the first inning, Archer delivered with stellar pitching, which kept the opposition hitless and scoreless until the fifth inning. Meanwhile, in the bottom of the fourth, already up three runs to none, Archer hit a triple to tack on two additional runs onto their four run cushion.</p><p>After six impressive innings from Archer in which he struck out eight batters while walking just two and allowing only three hits, sophomore Jeremy Rubin capped off the win with a solid one-hit, two strikeout inning.</p><p>A highlight of the game was the Peglegs’ success on the defensive side, an area they struggled with last season. “Although I had a rough first inning, my defense helped me get out of it, and we were able to keep the intensity through the remainder of the game,” Archer said.</p><p>The Peglegs are currently atop the AAA Western league at 4-0, highlighted by strong performances in all aspects of the game and victories against formidable opponents.</p><p>Against Newtown, the opening game for the team, the Peglegs showed their potential right out of the gate. They scored nine runs, led by Steinman, who earned a hit on each of his at bats, including a homerun and a triple, and finished with four runs batted in.</p><p>The strength of the pitching staff was in full effect as Archer threw five solid innings, allowing only three earned runs. He was followed by Rubin, who tossed two scoreless innings to close the game.</p><p>In the second game of a back to back, the Peglegs took on the defending AA-level champion Bayside, who was moved up to the AAA level and entered the game coming off a 10-run outing in which they lost despite great hitting. They were looking to get their offense running from the start, but senior Tobias Lange silenced the Bayside offense, throwing a complete game and allowing only one run.</p><p>From the start, it was evident that the work put in during the offseason was paying off. Despite having limited practices and cancelled games due to inclimate weather, the Peglegs have stayed focused, and this has contributed to their active winning streak.</p><p>“I feel that we are very deep in the pitching department and that I trust who ever I put out there. Not many teams can say that,” head coach John Carlesi said.</p><p>However, what has made the Peglegs a significantly improved team from last year is the consistent offense and fielding, areas they struggled in last year. “The first few games of the season have hopefully put down a basis for the team to build on. We have had excellent pitching, fielding, and situational hitting” Carlesi said. “Our defense was stellar [to start the season], a big weakness we had last year. We are only two games in, but I feel that this team has grown very close in the Fall and Winter, and it has shown on the field.”</p><p>Many new faces on the varsity team have made positive contributions to the improved defense. “[Junior] Max Onderdonk and [sophomore] Malcolm Hubbell are two new players [who] have been huge impact players on the defensive side” Archer said.</p><p>A few areas the team will look to improve on going forward is lowering their strikeout rate and putting more balls into play. They emphasize the importance of the fundamental areas of the game and will look to perfect it. “I think the team needs to focus more on ‘small ball.’ Bunting, hit and runs, and hitting behind the runner—these are things that are going to win us games this year,” Carlesi said.</p><p>If the team can improve on these areas during practice and continue their red-hot play, they will certainly be a scary opponent for their division rivals.</p><p>The Peglegs will look to continue their offensive momentum in their next game against the Francis Lewis Patriots, a team that has allowed eight runs per game, on Wednesday, April 19.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:57:15.632009	24	1	
361	﻿Girls’ Badminton Starts Out Strong	girls-badminton-starts-out-strong	<p>With a 5-0 win against Marta Valle High School on Thursday, March 30, Stuyvesant’s girls' badminton team started the season off strong. The match itself was quite relaxed, as Stuyvesant did not feel much pressure.</p><p>Their first match of the season ended in a forfeit because Murry Bergtraum lacked the necessary amount of players to compete. “We considered the game on Thursday the first game and the official start of the season. However, we weren’t anxious because the schools in our division except Seward Park are relatively new to the sport,” junior and co-captain Mickey Yu said.</p><p>The match against Marta Valle seemed like an opportunity for Stuyvesant to experiment and practice.</p><p>Junior Sion Kim began the match playing first singles against Marta Valle's Kashada Harewood. Kim won all three sets with high scores. However, she still saw ways that she could have improved. “Personally, I think that I could have done better, so I’m not exactly proud, but I was confident about winning,” she said.</p><p>In spite of her mistakes throughout the match, Kim played an impressive match, with the sets ending with scores of 21-3, 21-2, and 21-2.</p><p>The second singles match, played by junior Ida Wang against Marta Valle’s Tiavion Hughie, unfolded with a similar result. Though Wang has played the last two seasons as a doubles player and only became a singles player this season, there were no signs during her match that the transition has been difficult. She, like Kim, won all three of her sets, with her smallest margin of victory a comfortable 17 points.</p><p>Stuyvesant’s great results remained consistent throughout the rest of their matches, with newcomer sophomore Keying Wang winning her singles match as well. Her opponent offered a slightly better performance than her teammates, but still did little to prevent Wang from winning, again in three sets.</p><p>Yu and junior Janie Huang, a pairing familiar from last season, continued the team’s dominant performance, beating Marta Valle’s first doubles team of Cyane Huertas and Stefany Rivera. The second doubles match featured sophomore Tracy Chang alongside senior and co-captain Yiqing Hu. Chang and Hu are a rather recent partnership. Though Hu has been a doubles player for three years, Chang is new, switching from playing third singles to second doubles this season.</p><p>Their performance was not without its errors, but despite several missed serves, the pair was able to improve over the course of their match, and they went on to win all three of their sets against Marta Valle's Jalyssa Cintron and Tiffany Hunter, with scores of 21-10, 21-8, and 21-4. Their match concluded Stuyvesant's 5-0 victory.</p><p>The win set a bright tone for the remainder of the season. "We're pretty optimistic about how our season's [going to] be," coach Hugh Francis said. He credited the returning players, a group that includes seven of the last year’s eight starters, for the hopeful outlook he holds for the upcoming matches.</p><p>The team is looking forward to their match against Seward Park High School. Since the addition of badminton to the PSAL, Seward Park has often dominated the division and has become one of Stuyvesant's biggest rivals. They have proven themselves to be formidable opponents in past matches, having won four out of the six matches against Stuyvesant over previous seasons.</p><p>However, Yu maintains that they can bounce back from previous defeats and come out on top. “We were always on par with Seward Park. It’s hard to predict the outcome of the upcoming match against them, but we will try our best,” she said.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:57:58.317315	24	1	
362	﻿Peglegs Dominate The School of the Future	peglegs-dominate-the-school-of-the-future	<p>As senior and co-captain Joanne “Jojo” Cheng set up to serve the game winning ace for her first singles match against The School of the Future in the sixth floor gym, the other matches had already been won by Stuyvesant players with margins of at least 15 points.</p><p>This is nothing new for the girls’ handball team, the Peglegs, who have not lost a match this entire season. Every game, involving three singles matches and two doubles matches, has resulted in the players from Stuyvesant winning all five matches.</p><p>The game against the School of the Future was just another example of how successful the season has been. Even so, the Peglegs are staying focused on success after the regular season. “We’re used to winning by huge margins, but nonetheless, every game is important for getting into the playoffs. We’ve never been past the second round as long as I’ve coached, but with this senior and junior-heavy team, I’m confident we can make it further this year,” coach Eric Wisotsky said.</p><p>Regular season games seem to not cause a lot of stress for Cheng, who is a three-year veteran of the team. However, even after winning her match 21-4 against the School of the Future with 3 kills, she was critical of her game.“I was messing up my left-handed shots, and otherwise, I would have won 21-1 or zipped [my opponent] out,” Cheng said. This constant self-critique and desire to improve has played a large role in the success of the Peglegs this season and has helped them toward their 3-0 record.</p><p>A lot of intensity was also shown by senior Seo Hyun Park, who played second singles at this game. She was able to shut out her opponent, winning 21-0 with eight aces and two kills. Throughout her game, she was consistently locked in, seemingly giving an even greater effort when she was already winning by 15 points. Similarly, the first doubles pair at this game, consisting of senior Joanne Chung and junior Ariel Huang, only allowed their opponents to score one point the entire match, winning 21-1.</p><p>Playing third singles at this game, senior Vicky Huang won with the smallest margin, yet still finished with an impressive score of 21-6. She leads the team this year with 14 aces. “[I was] regretful that I didn’t win 21-0, as it would be my third consecutive victory zipping my opponent out,” Huang said. She also re-emphasized that even though the regular season is not very difficult and that players get to bolster up their stats, the team is still staying focused. Their next major game is against Laguardia, who have always given the Peglegs trouble.</p><p>Cheng also hopes that the Peglegs will face one of their major rivals, Bayside High School, who have eliminated Stuyvesant from the playoffs more than once. She hopes that this is the season the girls handball team will be able to finally defeat Bayside and reach the semifinals or even finals. Cheng thinks that winning a championship this season might motivate more talented players to join the Peglegs, and the team will be even stronger next year.</p><p>Although Stuyvesant often dominates their division during the regular season, having only one loss in the past three seasons, Bayside and Benjamin N. Cardozo High Schools have consistently eliminated the Peglegs early in the playoffs. Although the team is aware of this, they are doing their best to build up confidence during the regular season, so they will be in the best position heading into the playoffs.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:58:24.430792	24	1	Recapping the girls’ handball game against the School of the Future while also analyzing the season so far and looking to the playoffs.
365	﻿Beasts on Fire with Five-Game Win Streak	beasts-on-fire-with-five-game-win-streak	<p>Spectators started filling the stands, anxious to see the game between the Beasts, Stuyvesant’s boys’ volleyball team, and the Lions of Laguardia High School on Monday, April 3.</p><p>The game started off badly for the Beasts. Stuyvesant, heavily favored to win, had many missed bumps, serves and hits, and Laguardia quickly took a 6-1 lead. Coach Vasken Choubaralian called a timeout and berated the team for their careless errors, stating that to win, they couldn’t be overconfident. “There were a ridiculous number of [unfocused] errors, like missing serves and missed attacks, that are unacceptable at this point,” he said.</p><p>After the timeout, Stuyvesant came back, still trailing 7-9, but playing much better. After some strong spikes from juniors Justin Chan and Tommy Min, the Beasts took the lead and went up 15-12. Laguardia, who also missed many hits, was unable to bounce back, and Stuyvesant won the first set with a score of 25-16.</p><p>At the start of the second set, members of the Beasts still looked dejected, as they saw the team fail to play at the level they had in the past.</p><p>Junior Shun Bitar was able to give the team a small lead with his jump serves, but the team continued to commit many errors. Despite this, the Beasts were able to claw their way to a 12-5 lead, as even Stuyvesant’s lower level of play proved effective enough, and Laguardia committed even more errors.</p><p>The second set concluded with an impressive point by junior and setter Ray Jones. After one of one of Bitar’s spikes was blocked, Laguardia was left off balance, allowing Jones to shoot the ball into the far corner on the second touch.</p><p>Though they improved their record to 4-0, much of the game was very mediocre compared to the Beasts’ past games. Both teams made a lot of mistakes, mainly service errors, being unable to receive the ball and being unable to hit over. “[This game] was strange because we [had] a really good day on Saturday. We played [a lot of] strong teams and won many games, playing excellent volleyball. Today, we played like a completely different team. I’ve seen them do all these things much much better,” Choubaralian said.</p><p>With that win and a 2-1 victory over High School of Environmental Studies, they have started their season on a five-game winning streak. The first win of their season was an automatic forfeit, as the team from West 50th Street Campus High School failed to show up. The second win of the season came from a matchup against Louis Brandeis, a strong win in straight sets. The third win of the season came from another 2-0 win against High School for Math, Science and Engineering (HSMSE). It gave HSMSE, who is currently in second place in the Manhattan A West division, their only loss of the season.</p><p>The season has not been all smooth sailing for the Beasts. They have lost one non-league scrimmage against Benjamin N. Cardozo High School. Last year, Cardozo High School finished fourth in the PSAL tournament and they currently have a record of 3-0. Although the scrimmage will not affect the Beasts’ placement, teams like Cardozo could keep the team from advancing far in playoffs.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Jackson Deysine believes that the team always has the ability to do better. “The bounce back from scrim losses will really come from playing smarter as a team. Volleyball is [about] playing the ball intelligently, so I know that if we read the court better, we can easily win games against teams we lost to,” Deysine said.</p><p>Over the past few games, the juniors have helped the team in many ways. Much of the team’s starting lineup is made up of juniors, so they have come to make up a crucial part of the rotation. Jones is the starting setter with middle hitter Nick Kim. Additionally, Bitar, Chan, and Min are strong outside/opposite hitters, which give the Beasts good depth and options to rely on.</p><p>“The juniors are really the core of the team. The chemistry is almost there. Looking forward to next year, it’s reassuring to know that not much will change, and it will be mostly the same lineup,” Chan said.</p><p>The Beasts will be looking to use their practices to improve on their subpar performances. They need to work on forcing other teams to make errors instead of committing unforced errors themselves. With an undefeated record despite their mistakes, the season is looking bright for them moving forward.</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:59:28.951923	24	1	The Beasts beat Laguardia with a subpar performance, continuing their win streak.
417	﻿Greyducks Look to Become More Consistent	greyducks-look-to-become-more-consistent	<p>Stuyvesant’s indoor girls’ track team, the Greyducks, traveled to Armory Track on December 27 to compete in the PSAL Holiday Classic. Refreshed from the holidays and the break, the team was determined to succeed at the meet after their rocky and inconsistent start to the season.</p><p>In their first two meets, the team had struggled but got back on track with a solid showing at the Day of Distance on December 23. The team’s placement was erratic again, performing well in some events but struggling in others.</p><p>There were many bright spots for the team, particularly in the varsity events. Senior Daria Shifrina finished fifth out of 14 participants in the high jump with a height of 4 feet, 8 inches and sixth out of 28 participants in the triple jump with a distance of 32 feet, 5 inches. Sophomore Tina Zheng finished 10th out of 33 participants in the weight throw with a distance of 27 feet, 11.5 inches. The Greyducks had a solid showing from their field team and are hoping that will continue as the season progresses.</p><p>In the track portion of the meet, juniors Bernice Chen (8:42:25), Kayla Lew (8:51:36), and Jeanette Cheung (8:55:51) finished third, fourth, and fifth, respectively, out of 20 participants in the 1500-meter racewalk, and junior Clara Mohri finished in second (10:56:58) out of 17 runners in the 3000-meter run. This strong junior class will look to help lead the team both this season and next.</p><p>However, the Greyducks finished in the middle of the pack in events like the 1000-meter run and the 300-meter dash. The team also did not compete in any of the relays. “The season is off to a decent start. We’ve already had several athletes qualify for the PSAL Championships, but we’ve also had a lot of injuries and health issues that have hampered us,” coach Carl DiSarno said.</p><p>Mohri has qualified for the 1500-meter run and the 3000-meter run, Shifrina has qualified for the triple jump, and Chen has qualified for the 1500-meter racewalk. The team will look to send as many members as possible to compete and represent Stuyvesant in the Championships.</p><p>“We’re also a very young team, with lots of freshmen and sophomores, so we’re also still figuring out what everyone is good at,” DiSarno said. A staggering 36 of the 46 athletes on the official roster are underclassmen.</p><p>This inexperience also creates an atmosphere of competitiveness. “We are starting to ramp up the work. We are excited to work to beat our personal records, as well as trying to run good races and potentially qualify for City’s [championships],” freshman Julianne Yotov said. The Greyducks are looking to become more consistent and reach their top form going into the second half of the season as the Borough and City Championships draw even closer.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:59:19.884056	2018-01-23 02:59:20.055048	24	1	The Greyducks hope to reach their top form going into the second half of the season.
373	Kern No Longer Working at Stuyvesant	kern-no-longer-working-at-stuyvesant	<p>Machinist Kern Levigion was dismissed from his position as a provisional worker at Stuyvesant on Wednesday, May 6. He worked at Stuyvesant for 23 years, assisting the janitors in maintaining technological equipment. Levigion was notified on Wednesday, April 22, by the Department of Education (DOE) Human Resources Department that in response to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to remove all provisional employees across the city, his services at Stuyvesant would no longer be needed.</p><p>This proposal by the de Blasio administration addresses the fact that many provisional employees have been on the city’s payroll for years without having passed a civil service examination. Levigion is said to be among the DOE’s 4000 provisional employees who have been affected due to a lack of certification.</p><p>Levigion was viewed as a necessary part of the staff by the student body because he facilitated student run productions such as SING! and the Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)  in their efforts. “He was sort of an enigma. He basically did a bunch of odd jobs around the school that no one else knew how to do. I'm not sure how we're going to do some of those things anymore,” senior Thomas Perskin said.</p><p>Additionally, students have voiced their concern for Levigion and outrage at the city’s action. “As someone who knew Kern personally, I'm really upset,” said junior Annebelle Gary, who has worked closely with Kern in the technological aspects of SING! and STC. “I would love to see him get his job back and I am going to do anything I can to help him.”</p><p>This is not the first time Levigion's job has been at risk. In 2011, the title of machinist was to be removed by the DOE, and Levigion along with 13 other DOE employed machinists were to be laid off. In response, students signed a petition contesting this decision. Levigion was soon rehired by the administration after the discovery that two other mechanists had retained their jobs.</p><p>There has been speculation about other possible reasons for his dismissal. “The official statement is that the decision was made due [to a] personnel issue, done on the level of the human relations department. I can only give you this one statement,” Assistant Principal of Guidance Casey Pedrick said.</p><p>  </p><p>          Levigion declined to speak with The Spectator on the matter, but is believed to be taking steps towards reclaiming the position he held.</p>	105	14	\N	2015-05-06 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 19:55:06.505824	1	1	
374	Four-Digit IDs to be Discontinued Starting Next Year	four-digit-ids-to-be-discontinued-starting-next-year	<p>The use of Stuyvesant-assigned four-digit student identification (ID) numbers will be discontinued starting with the 2016-2017 school year. Instead, DOE-assigned nine-digit OSIS numbers will be used as students’ primary identification numbers. This is aligned with the implementation of eSchoolData (eSD), the data management and communication software that replaced Daedalus, or “Student Tools.” Concerns have arisen as to whether the use of OSIS numbers will be an efficient alternative after years of reliance on four-digit ID numbers to organize student records.</p><p>Before four-digit IDs were created, computers were not yet used for data management. When former Assistant Principal of Technology Steve Kramer created the Daedalus software, he instilled a customization that formed four-digit IDs with the program. Due to their short lengths and compatibility with Daedalus, four-digit ID numbers have provided a more convenient way of student identification and data management for Stuyvesant. Currently, four-digit IDs are used in the library to keep track of borrowed books, as well as for attendance and grading records.</p><p>Despite this convenience, four-digit IDs have caused structural errors. In the past, four-digit IDs were re-assigned upon graduation. Occasionally, there would be duplicates or other mistakes in ID assignment. In order to avoid these mistakes, the class of 2019 was assigned four-digit ID numbers beginning with the number five instead of recycling last year’s seniors’ ID numbers, which began with the number one. “There was a consensus among [the administration] that four-digit IDs cause complications at times,” Principal Jie Zhang said.</p><p>However, the decision to use OSIS numbers as the primary form of student identification was not a choice made by the administration. Kramer decided that he would discontinue Daedalus in July 2015. Hence, his decision forced Zhang to sign a new contract with eSD, a DOE system intended to work with students’ OSIS numbers.</p><p>The potential inefficiency of OSIS numbers for conducting hands-on administrative tasks is a concern among the school community. “At an operational level, OSIS numbers are less efficient. However, eSchoolData does not have the function to support four-digit IDs. I like the four-digit, but moving forward, we cannot ask this vendor to modify their program specifically for us,” Zhang said.</p><p>Many student-run clubs and publications rely on four-digit IDs to keep track of their members’ activity. ARISTA, for example, uses four-digit IDs to keep track of members’ credits. “Our credit spreadsheet is public for all members of the organization, so we list credits with four-digit IDs instead of actual names to protect members’ privacy,” ARISTA President Ariel Levy said. A similar problem affects other large clubs like Red Cross, which also uses a public spreadsheet to keep track of members’ volunteer hours. “[A] possible solution would be to create our own ID number system,” Levy said. She also acknowledged that OSIS numbers could replace four-digit IDs.</p><p>Despite the connection between OSIS numbers and the DOE, using them in such public spreadsheets does not pose a risk to student privacy. “OSIS numbers and four-digit IDs are interchangeable. Knowing a student’s OSIS number does not mean you have access to their records,” Zhang said.</p><p>Interaction with the DOE will be easier with the use of OSIS numbers. “We [the programming office] prefer that [eSD] uses OSIS numbers because when we work with students’ data, the Department of Education only recognizes OSIS numbers,” Programming Chairperson Joy Hsiao said. Before the predominant use of OSIS numbers, the programming office had to follow the procedure of individually merging four-digit ID numbers with OSIS numbers.</p><p>The replacement of four-digit IDs will change the organizational structure of Stuyvesant, which is something that both students and the staff will have to adjust to.</p>	106	4	\N	2015-10-30 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 19:55:50.917321	1	1	
376	SLT Meeting Sparks Discussion over Pedrick’s Position	slt-meeting-sparks-discussion-over-pedrick-s-position	<p>“More than simply helping me out as Student Union President, Ms. Pedrick has been there for every chaotic moment of my life. She saved me from my own self. ” —Ares Aung, SU President</p><p>“We support the functions and personnel in college, guidance, and other pupil personnel services under [Pedrick’s] direction. [We] are against rash changes that would result in great reductions in those areas.” —Wai Wah Chin, Senior SLT Parent Representative</p><p>Student Union President Ares Aung posted a petition on Facebook on Thursday, October 1, entitled, “What Pedrick Means to Stuy.” The petition stated, “Two anonymous faculty advisors proposed to strip [Pedrick] of her position as a result of her interim status, at the Student Leadership Team meeting on September 30th, 2015.” Principal Jie Zhang, however, has said that while Casey Pedrick may not become the official Assistant Principal of Personnel Services—the position she now occupies is considered “interim,” or temporary — Pedrick is likely to retain her position.</p><p>This discussion over Pedrick’s position began when United Federation of Teachers Chapter Leader and math teacher Bernard Feigenbaum proposed to reduce the number of Assistant Principals of Administration from four to three at the School Leadership Team (SLT) meeting in order to hire a new staff member. Math teacher Melissa Protass also described current problems with class sizes that a new teacher could resolve. Principal Jie Zhang responded that the only way to do so would be to eliminate the position of Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services, currently occupied by Pedrick, because it is the only one of the four positions that is not permanently filled.</p><p>Zhang clarified that her comments during the SLT meeting did not mean that she agrees with either side. “I simply stated the facts, the conditions that there need to be in order to have fewer Assistant Principals,” Zhang said. Pedrick declined to be interviewed on the topic.</p><p>There are four administrative positions because in 2012, due to a request by the Department of Education, Zhang increased the number of Assistant Principals of Administration from three to four by hiring Assistant Principal of Safety and Security Brian Moran. “It was right after the cheating scandal, and I thought that we needed a new position to handle everything.  Now that it’s been several years, we don’t need a full-time person to have the position, so I combined [Moran’s] duties with the Assistant Principal of Health and Physical Education.”” Zhang said.</p><p>Normally, interim-acting assistant principals hold their unofficial statuses for half a year before being appointed officially or dismissed. However, Pedrick’s case is special, because Pedrick could not be officially appointed to her position until Assistant Principal of Technology Services Randi Damasek’s case was settled. “It has to do with the fact that Damesek was undergoing investigation [regarding the cheating scandal], and her case was not closed. This caused a personnel issue,” Zhang said.</p><p>Now that Damasek has returned, Zhang released a posting for the official position of Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services. “Pedrick and other candidates have applied, and in theory, the school can choose to appoint someone else,” Zhang said. “However, the position is not hers [until] she is appointed.”</p><p>The majority of the SLT Parent Representatives want Pedrick to retain her position. “We support the functions and personnel in college, guidance, and other pupil personnel services under [Pedrick’s] direction. [We] are against rash changes that would result in great reductions in those areas,” Senior SLT Parent Representative Wai Wah Chin said.</p><p>In a separate interview, Aung said that he showed Zhang the petition to make Pedrick an official assistant principal. “Nothing really changed. The Chancellor’s Regulation 30 (C-30) [the process to select a new assistant principal] is still happening, so that’s good,” Aung said.</p>	106	3	\N	2015-10-16 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 19:57:12.963041	1	1	
378	﻿We’re All Mad Here	we-re-all-mad-here	<p>Elizabeth Woolridge Grant was dressed plainly in a blue shirt and jeans. She didn’t look like she belonged in some of the clubs and bars where legends like Lady Gaga and Jay Z started their careers. Not many of us even recall hearing about the album created by Lizzy Grant, this young girl who spoke quietly despite her robust voice.</p><p>That’s because fame didn’t happen for Grant, but fame did happen for someone called Lana Del Rey, a name associated with mysterious and seductive sadness. Yet, Grant and Del Rey are the same person. However, Del Rey’s persona is nothing like Grant’s. It isn’t simply Del Rey’s soaring vocals and seedy self-styled videos that set her apart from Grant, but her ability to use depression as a publicity strategy.</p><p>In a recent interview with The Guardian, Del Rey was quoted saying, “I wish I was dead already,” and this became the headline. This incited discussion about whether Del Rey’s words were simply a reflection of how she felt or a statement that crafted her image.</p><p>Regardless of her motivations, her discussion of mental health has become a double-edged sword. Many attribute the new dialogue about mental illness to such media recognition. Yet, at the same time, the media itself is creating the very ignorance and stigmatization we are working to break down.</p><p>What is most daunting about the media’s depiction of mental illness is how it is marketed and characterized. Oftentimes, we associate the mentally ill with traits like violence, irrationality, and a blatant disregard of personal space.</p><p>“Orange is the New Black” (2013-present) character Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren is a female inmate who lacks social skills and suffers from emotional outbursts. Despite the television series being based on a true story, “Crazy Eyes” is depicted extremely different from her real life inspiration.</p><p>Unlike the woman on whom she is based, not only does “Crazy Eyes”  have stereotypical traits that we commonly associate with mental illness, but she’s also presented as a black woman, while her real life inspiration is Caucasian.</p><p>At first glance, it is very easy to dismiss “Crazy Eyes” as comedic relief within the cutthroat environment of Litchfield Penitentiary, but simultaneously, her name alone portrays the stigmatization of mental illness that has become inherent in pop culture. Reflecting on how she is constantly misunderstood and viewed as inferior, Crazy Eyes says, “I should have answered the questions in the reverse of how I felt. The opposite of me is better.”</p><p>All too often, not only do we label the real-life mentally ill with negative characteristics because of the media's portrayal, but we heavily stereotype mental illness by visualizing the mentally ill as disproportionately African American.</p><p>This racialization of mental illness, which has been encouraged by the media, historically had profound effects on already oppressed and marginalized communities by delegitimizing protests against oppressive social structures. For example, with the end of slavery, schizophrenia diagnoses increased among the black community, not because the members were at any increased risk for the disease, but because mental illness was used as a weapon to continue to dismiss people of this community. Today’s media must take into account how drastically the racialization of mental illness can affect minority groups.</p><p>The media frequently portrays women with mental illnesses as intent and conscious of their choices. Their actions are often portrayed as malicious rather than stemming from an illness in which the audience should sympathize with. However, at the same time, men with almost identical traits are often portrayed as admirable protagonists who are conquering their illness.</p><p>In the film “Gone Girl” (2014), when Amy Elliot Dunne marries Nick Dunne, her life seems to be finally shaping up. Yet, when Amy finds that Nick is cheating on her, she puts her grand scheme for retaliation in motion.</p><p>Amy’s character represents the skewed social attitudes about mental illness and women because no one can really pinpoint whether she suffers from narcissistic personality disorder or if she is simply a woman scorned. Either way, Amy is presented as a psychopath who remains unconcerned by how her actions affect anyone around her as long as she is still cast in the spotlight. Despite her husband Nick’s infidelity and abuse, the viewer often is sympathetic to his situation, while easily disregarding Amy’s pain and motivation.</p><p>When mentally ill white males are depicted in pop culture, their personalities are viewed as relatable to the human condition. White males have been cast for roles from serial killer Dexter to beloved stockbroker Jordan Belfort, and both are highly intelligent and exude charisma.</p><p>In another instance, Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film “Psycho” (1960) presents Norman Bates, a schizophrenic white man who can only be described as creepy and scary. Yet, mentally ill white males who are presented in pop culture with these negative traits are treated as outliers and specified cases, and these traits are viewed as not intrinsic because of their gender or race.</p><p>That said, mental illness is not always portrayed in a negative light in pop culture. Lana Del Rey sculpts suicide as a romantic and ethereal experience as she croons in “In the Sun,” “Baby, couldn't stop, it was suicide/ Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide.” Such glamorous lyrics have teens yearning to have a disorder, especially depression.</p><p>Yet what the media often fails to present is that depression isn’t solely overwhelming emotions of angst, but can feel like nothing. The media takes the terror out of mental illness. Of course, we shouldn’t regress to a state where mental illness is a taboo, but we do need to become aware of the depth and many faces of mental illness, instead of allowing it to remain behind the pictures of pills that are tagged “#beautiful,” “#softgrunge,” and  “#romantic” on our Tumblr dashboards.</p><p>The next time we engage with pop culture concerning mental illness, it is important that we take note of how it depicts these circumstances and who it depicts. At the end of the day, our discussion oftentimes reinforces or resists the stereotypes and stigmas surrounding mental illness. We must reject our ideas about mental illness and truly educate ourselves on mental illnesses and the very real effects they have on lives.</p><p>Similarly, both casting directors and celebrities alike must think about whether their actions are furthering the romanticization and stereotypes that surround mental illness. Singers like Del Rey need to understand that their audience is comprised of teenagers, who are often blindly trying to emulate the words, choices, and actions of their musical idols, without truly understanding the consequences that follow.</p>	107	1	\N	2017-09-09 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 20:35:20.071821	4	1	To examine how the portrayal of mental illness in pop culture affects our perceptions and mentalities.

380	﻿Unprecedented Presidents: Uncontested Tickets for Senior Caucus and Student Union	unprecedented-presidents-uncontested-tickets-for-senior-caucus-and-student-union	<p>Student Union (SU) candidates Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino and Senior Caucus candidates Pallab Saha and Abie Rohrig ran uncontested, perhaps out of respect or perhaps out of fear; both tickets wielded formidable experience and accolades.</p><p><h4>Pallab Saha and Abraham Rohrig — Senior Caucus</h4></p><p>“We took [running uncontested] as a sign that the Class of 2018 really trusts us and that just motivates us to do more for them,” Saha said. Their platform reflects this drive and speaks to their previous successes in the Junior Caucus.</p><p>This year, Saha and Rohrig not only understood the importance of aiding the juniors’ college search, by developing close ties with the Alumni Association and selling preparatory books in the school store, but also focused on counteracting grade-wide apathy with a Pep Rally.</p><p>However, they are aware that the roles they needed to assume as the Junior Caucus differ from those they will have to as the Senior Caucus. “[After] senior year, we are leaving behind all the memories we’ve made,” Rohrig said. “The Senior Caucus makes sure a grade identity is formed.”</p><p>Saha and Rohrig have divided their platform into four major components: leaving a mark, moving on to the next chapter, reinforcing school spirit, and embracing senior year.</p><p>In order to leave a mark, Saha and Rohrig will revitalize the Mnemonics Public Art Project, commonly known as the Memory Cubes. “We want to reach out to [Principal Eric] Contreras and [Assistant Principal of Security, Health, and Physical Education Brian] Moran so that the Class of 2018 has a say in what goes into our memory [cube],” Rohrig said.</p><p>They also aim to begin mentoring underclassmen caucuses and collaborating closely with the SU. “I think that a problem within the SU this year has been a lack of communication between the caucuses and the SU, and there have been a couple of instances where this has happened,” Rohrig said. “The SU only has a certain amount of political capital, and if each caucus is just doing their own individual thing and the SU isn’t on the same page, then the SU as a whole isn’t able to coalesce, discuss, and prioritize.”</p><p>In regards to moving onto the next chapter, Saha and Rohrig want to continue their efforts in making opportunities available to the student body. They plan to establish a task force to aid Internship Coordinator Harvey Blumm to build upon the Student Bulletin and create an online database of Stuyvesant alumni for students to reach out to. “As seniors, we need to start focusing on what we need to do with our futures,” Saha said. “We can have a career day, where students can learn more about the opportunities they have and their futures.”</p><p>Despite having an organized vision for the Senior Caucus, Saha and Rohrig intend to continue a well-established method of communication through e-mail and Facebook, gauging the interests and needs of the senior class. To further strengthen school spirit, they propose beginning a PSAL awards ceremony.</p><p>Having already worked with Princeton Review to subsidize the cost of JProm, Saha and Rohrig plan to use this growing relationship to help make senior activities more affordable. “We also talked to [Princeton Review] about building more of a relationship going forward, where they are going to post practice tests for Stuyvesant students in exchange for funding,” Rohrig said. “By subsidizing costs, [we hope] everyone is able to attend these events that make up the huge memories of senior year.”</p><p>They are also exploring the possibility of an alternative venue for graduation. “We want to see if we can get a better venue,” Saha said. “We want to look at Madison Square Garden or Lincoln Center. [Though,] the budget has been a problem.”</p><p>Overall, Saha and Rohrig are confident in their abilities to carry out these plans. “The reason why we had such a successful junior year was because of how efficient our partnership is,” Saha said. “We don’t see each other with the distinction of President or Vice President. We go at it as Co-Presidents.”</p><p><h4>Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino — Student Union</h4></p><p>“Every SU in the past and every platform that you’ve seen in the past always has specific ideas, and we lack that, and that’s good,” Chowdhury said. The SU President-elect and his running mate are taking a radically new approach, opting for a broad vision rather than a detailed agenda. They presented a 29 page platform — not outlining new policies, but explaining how they will structure the SU to be “bigger, bolder, and better.”</p><p>“Our goal is to create an SU that is able to do everything, all the time. Anything people ask for, we’re going to deliver,” Chowdhury said. They paused to qualify. “[If it’s] Reasonable. That’s important,” Valentino said.</p><p>As Vice President, Chowdhury has already expanded the SU by a factor of ten to include over 200 members, and Valentino has worked rigorously to ensure they have a tightly-run operation. “What we want to do is create a stable SU and a stable organization. Students don’t have power because there isn’t stability,” Chowdhury said. They believe this larger, more efficient SU has already proven itself, citing success in establishing a printing station and bathroom hooks.</p><p>In the coming year, they aim to consolidate the different caucuses into a unified front, which will be able to tackle grandiose projects and make bold demands. “What ends up happening is the administration views the students as one whole group, so if a caucus gets something then another caucus might not. At the end of the day we’re really just one union, so we’re going to look at the caucus platforms and we’re going to create a [single] year-long agenda that we’re going to execute,” Chowdhury said.</p><p>They do have a few specific ideas for putting their expanded power to use, including a second Club Pub Fair and locker trading system, the latter of which is nearing completion. Most ambitious is opening up the fifth floor balcony. With improved organization and a designated task force, they believe this could soon become feasible. “We’re better able to get a grasp [on SU organization] so now we are able to designate someone specifically in charge of working on the fifth floor balcony project,” Valentino said.</p><p>Their victory is impressive for two reasons. Obviously, they ran unopposed. But perhaps more importantly, Valentino is the first female SU Vice President in years, following a “dynasty” consisting of five consecutive male presidents and vice presidents.</p><p>“I’m really proud to say I’m one of the first female representatives of the SU in a really long time. It’s kind of cheesy, [but] other females should be inspired to be in the government and I just hope that I do a good job,” Valentino said.</p><p>As for running unopposed, Chowdhury takes it as a vote of confidence. “I think people genuinely believe we did a decent job this year compared to previous years and compared to what other people could do, and they’re giving us the opportunity to complete what we started, and that’s what the platform is, completing what we started,” he said.</p>	107	15	\N	2017-05-26 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 20:44:27.413388	7	1	
424	﻿Can Phoenix Rise Again After a Rough Start?	can-phoenix-rise-again-after-a-rough-start	<p>When I spoke to senior and co-captain Shannon Lau of the Stuyvesant Phoenix girls’ basketball team back in December, she exuded an infectious hope. “I truly think we have what it takes to reclaim first in our division,” said Lau, as she meticulously detailed the steps that the team planned to take after falling out of first place in the Manhattan A South Division for the first time in three years. Lau sold me on her optimism, citing improvements like head coach Vincent Miller’s new free throw regimen, involving 20-30 free-throws per practice and sprints after missed ones. It seemed as though the Phoenix had put in place an aggressive plan to rectify their woes at the stripe that had plagued them so severely a year ago.</p><p>Unfortunately, 10 games in, the Phoenix’s season has not treated them kindly. Even with a decisive 67-55 victory against Bayard Rustin Educational Complex, the Phoenix have already matched last season’s loss total (five) and have not improved very much at all at the free throw line. Last year, just five players shot over 50 percent on free throws (Lau, senior and co-captain Delaney Demark and juniors Maya Zabari, Ally Archer, and Ruby Gary). Of the five, though, only Lau and Archer received what could be considered substantial reps. This year, that figure is even lower. Zabari and Gary are no longer on the team, and only two players (Lau and junior guard Britni Canale) are shooting over 50 percent on free throws. Considering that Canale has only shot four total free throws, Lau is the only player with free throw shooting success over an extensive span. Not everyone on the team, however, sees free throw shooting as being as pernicious as it may seem. “As a whole, free throw shooting isn’t a very prominent issue, but we could always do better,” Demark said. The team has lost all five games by more than five points, suggesting that the Phoenix slow start could be attributed to something deeper—for instance, a lack of a dominating rebounding presence.</p><p>In the 2016-2017 season, the Phoenix were defined by a frontcourt that dominated the glass. Archer, at center, and junior power forward Talia Kirshenbaum combined for nearly 20 rebounds each game. But Kirshenbaum missed the first eight games of this season while she was at the Mountain School, hurting the team’s rebounding prowess. Archer’s production has increased (12.2 rebounds per game), and the team has enjoyed an unprecedented breakout performance by sophomore Eve Wening, who raised her rebounding numbers by nearly five rebounds per game from a season ago, but they have not matched last year’s totals.</p><p>Kirshenbaum returned to the team in mid-January in thunderous fashion. Albeit in a minuscule sample size, she has averaged 14 rebounds per game, the highest by any Phoenix over the past four years. It has had a profound impact on the rest of the team, which has been markedly more competitive as of late. The dominant 67-55 win came against a respectable Bayard Rustin team which has hovered around .500 all season, and the 54-48 loss to Graphics Campus came against a high-powered, 9-2 team whose only losses came at the hands of 10-2 Millennium High School and undefeated Lab Museum United. Furthermore, according to Demark, the loss to Graphics Campus might have been close enough for free throw shooting to have played a role: “In Monday’s game against Graphics, free throw shooting did prove to be a bit of an issue, but that’s really the only instance this season in which this significantly impacted the outcome of the game,” Demark said. It’s safe to say that Kirshenbaum’s return has been felt by everyone on Stuyvesant’s roster. “What Talia’s doing on this team is crazy,” Lau said.</p><p>Ultimately, Kirshenbaum’s return could be what revitalizes the Phoenix back into championship contention. The three-headed monster of Kirshenbaum and Archer both potentially putting up double-digit rebounds and Wening coming off the wing with countless more could be a fearsome mismatch going forward, and this could spark a streak of success into February. “I’m confident that we can bring this perseverance across the remainder of the season,” Lau said.</p><p>In the end, though, only time will tell how dramatic such a turnaround will be. In the next seven games, the Phoenix play just two teams with winning records: Millennium High School and Seward Park Campus. If they can sweep the other five games, they should cruise into the playoffs. However, if they slip up, it could spell a low seed in the playoffs, and perhaps an early ticket home.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 03:03:47.025992	2018-01-23 03:03:47.14547	24	1	After a slow, 5-5 start, junior Talia Kirshenbaum’s rebounding presence could be what it takes to push the Phoenix back into contention.
360	﻿A Solid Start for the Huskies	a-solid-start-for-the-huskies	<p>After having to miss multiple practices and four league games due to cold weather, the Huskies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ lacrosse team, began their season on March 27 against a KIPP NYC College Prep team. The girls were eager to finally start their season as they took charge of the field at Randall’s Island.</p><p>The delayed start to the season did not seem to phase the Huskies, as they were well-trained and seemed to be in midseason form right from the start. Led by senior and co-captain Lucy Wang, who finished the game with 12 goals on 14 shots, the Huskies maintained a substantial lead throughout the game, defeating KIPP with a score of 15-5.</p><p>The following game, the Huskies followed up with a solid 13-6 win over Frederick Douglass Academy in which Wang scored another eight goals on eight shots.</p><p>Though the Huskies got off to a quick start, they were faced with a 19-3 loss against Hunter. Though Wang scored two of the Huskies’ three goals, she felt that a lack of preparation combined with the incorrect mindset was their undoing. “A lot of it was bad mentality, if not from the rain, then from whatever. I think our biggest problem was catching. Our lack of practices shows in our passing, catching and ground balls,” Wang said.</p><p>The following game against Bronx Science saw a renewed effort by the team to try to defeat a longstanding rival.  Their vigor and determination led to a closely fought battle where Bronx Science came out on top by a close margin of 11-10.  Wang tacked on five more goals and continued to be an important presence on the field for the Huskies.</p><p>In their last game against Christopher Columbus Campus, the Huskies saw their hard work and practice pay off as they had a resounding 7-0 win.  Wang continued her tear as she scored five more goals, adding up to an impressive season total of 32 goals.</p><p>The Huskies had a different start to their season than last year’s team. Their 3-2 record, with one of the losses being the 11-10 against Bronx Science, is drastically different from their 1-4 start last season.</p><p>The team still managed to make the playoffs last season, but were eliminated in the first round.</p><p>Now, with a strong list of returning players, the team has been able to score wins right from the start. Wang has been a huge part of this initial success, scoring 32 goals on 41 attempts, ranking her first in all of PSAL in goals scored.</p><p>In addition to her individual success, she credits many of her teammates for improving this season. “Juniors Leila Storkamp and Inbar Pe'er have really stepped up and contributed to this start,” she said.

The Peglegs had lost to Albert Tuitt Educational Campus with a final score of 2-0 and Frederick Douglass Academy with a final score of 12-5.</p><p>After these losses, the team looked back at their play and realized the one key component they were lacking in was their offense. “Our defense has been very strong so far, but our offense really needs to take it to the next level. Our biggest problem is being aggressive and going for shots,” senior and co-captain Winston Venderbush said.</p><p>The Peglegs traced many of their early struggles to a heavy reliance on a few players. In the first two games of the season, senior and co-captain Michael Joh and senior Ledion Lecaj were the only players to score goals, combining for only five.</p><p>These losses were a wake up call. “We can never underestimate our opponents and must play every team as if they were the best,” Joh said.</p><p>Venderbush was shocked that the Peglegs lost their first two games. “I thought it was really winnable. We just came onto the field as a bunch of individuals rather than a team,” he said.</p><p>With these issues recognized, the Peglegs went on to win the next three games, scoring a combined 23 goals in these games, while only giving up five goals in return. “I think we definitely pulled together as a team more for the next [three] games and were able to win together.

Everyone else improved a lot, and we have good chemistry, as almost every starter is going to be a senior,” he said.</p><p>Both the doubles duos, senior Jasper Li and Wu and seniors Stanley Lee, Yongheng Zhou, and Daniel Chiu, have gotten perfect matches (winning the match 21-0), along with singles players senior James Young and senior Edwin Lee. Young and Lee lead the team with 33 aces in five matches, while senior Jonathan Shi lead the team with 12 kills in five matches.</p><p>Wu is very optimistic about this season and thinks the team is on track for a perfect season. “Everyone has played pretty well so far, and we already won [half] of our hardest matches in the league,” Wu said. “Hopefully, we’ll be able to leave behind a legacy for the handball team that future handball teams could follow.”</p>	107	13	\N	2017-04-21 22:57:55.149	2017-12-24 16:59:17.959669	24	1	The Stuyvesant Dragons, following a third round playoff exit last year, and consisting of an experienced, senior-heavy team, look for their first title.
381	﻿German Pop Duo DieLochis Performs at Stuyvesant	german-pop-duo-dielochis-performs-at-stuyvesant	<p>The Murray Kahn Theatre was buzzing with activity and anticipation. The seats were filled, and the stage was outfitted with platforms, on which stood a drum set, a keyboard, a DJ booth, and a guitar stand. On either side of the stage were banners promoting the Goethe-Institut, a non-profit German cultural association, and plastered on the back wall was a promotional poster for the German pop duo, DieLochis, that performed on Monday, December 4.</p><p>The duo is comprised of 18-year-old twin brothers Roman and Heiko Lochmann. For the past few weeks they had been touring schools around the United States with the Goethe-Institut as part of their “Schools: Partners for the Future (PASCH)” initiative.</p><p>The Goethe Institut promotes the education of German language and culture and presents contemporary German culture, such as DieLochis, to the world.</p><p>Roman and Heiko Lochmann have been amassing an enormous social media following since starting their YouTube channel six and a half years ago, at age 12. They have nearly 2.5 million YouTube subscribers, a combined total of 2.8 million Instagram followers, and their most popular video currently stands at 22 million views. “Music is and was a big passion our entire life. We [had] already [written] many songs, [played] a lot of music, and we [asked] our teacher if we [could] play at the school event so we [could] be on stage. So, it started very early [on] in our life,” Roman Lochmann said.</p><p>The duo is widely known in Germany: their album made number one on the German billboard charts and and they have a trending hashtag #zwilling, which means “#twin.” However, they admitted to having difficulties performing in the United States. “In Germany, most people know who we are. It’s another experience to play in a country, [where] no one knows who we are, no one knows our songs and stuff. It’s just crazy,” Roman Lochmann said.</p><p>The concert began with opening remarks from Principal Eric Contreras, a representative from the Goethe-Institut, and a representative from the German consulate in New York City. The brothers then ran on stage, spending the next few hours dancing, jumping, and interacting with their band. Throughout the concert they tried their best to pump up the crowd, encouraging people to put their phones away, stand up, dance, and have fun. Though they were not entirely successful, with some students staying seated, the brothers managed to get the majority of the audience moving.</p><p>While their music is in German, English is the twins’ second language, and so in between sets they professed their love for New York and explained the meanings of some of the songs, often talking about universal themes like friendship, heartbreak, and coming of age. “When you feel the music, you don’t have to understand the language to have fun,” Roman Lochmann said. “The main language of music [is] emotions,” Heiko Lochmann said.</p><p>In spite of language barriers, most students responded positively to the performance. “I expected the students to be sitting while two strangers sang at us, but it was actually much more interactive and amazing. It was what I expected an actual concert to be like instead of a showcase or performance,” junior Hanah Jun said.</p><p>The administration is hopeful that similar events can be scheduled soon. “We’re becoming a PASCH school. I think we will [also] be working closer with the Goethe-Institut in the future. They have a lot of interesting programs to offer,” German and French teacher Rebecca Lindemulder said.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-19 16:40:19.229394	2018-01-23 03:13:04.421358	1	5

It was almost like the sky and all the light on Earth turned off for a moment. The eclipse has forever changed the way I'll feel about space and nature, and simply knowing that millions of people from across the country were watching and enjoying the same moment in time has been my favorite part of 2017. It felt like everyone could take a moment to forget about everything—politics, work, life—and could just enjoy nature. Just that day, it felt like our country was perhaps the most united it's been for a while.”</p><p>“My birthday was celebrated so many times this year because I'm here in Egypt visiting my family.

370	New York Times Columnist Addresses College Admissions Mania	new-york-times-columnist-addresses-college-admissions-mania	<p>Frank Bruni, a columnist for The New York Times, visited Stuyvesant on Tuesday, March 3, from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Murray Khan Theater to speak about the growing belief that a student’s future starts and ends with an Ivy League education. The talk was organized by the Stuyvesant Parent’s Association and hosted by co-presidents David Venderbush and Lynn Chen During the lecture, Bruni used excerpts from his book “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be,” as well as anecdotes about successful men and women, to convey his belief that our society places too much emphasis on the college admissions process.</p><p>Bruni, a graduate of both the University of North Carolina and Columbia University, has worked in various positions for The New York Times and has written books about topics including cuisine and politics. “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be” was released on March 15, 2015, and currently resides on The New York Times Best Sellers list in Hardcover Non- Fiction.</p><p>Bruni began his talk by reading an email he had received from a high school senior who was going through the college process at that time. The email showed an example of a student who felt a great amount of pressure about how the college she would attend would determine her life, introducing Bruni’s point that college is incorrectly perceived as a deciding factor in making or breaking someone’s entire career.</p><p>Bruni went on to say that the “system is broken” and asked the audience whether the process is helping or harming to a child. “We are sending an extremely dangerous message that once you get into a good college you're home free,” Bruni said in the lecture.</p><p>Bruni incorporated both statistics and stories about well-known people such as author John Green and Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks Howard Schultz, who exemplify the concept that it is possible to reach high levels of success in ways other than attending Ivy League universities.</p><p>One point mentioned was that a large number of people listed as MacArthur Genius Grant Award winners, a highly regarded competition for excellence in different academic backgrounds, attended colleges such as Louisiana State University and the University of Maryland, schools that are not as widely praised in the general media. These successful people were able to use their colleges to gain skills such as better communication and confidence that eventually led to more opportunities in their individual fields. These examples support Bruni’s assertion that the discourse surrounding college is incorrect. “We should not have conversations about how to get into college, but how to use college,” Bruni said.</p><p>Many parents found the lecture to be a refreshing and eye-opening experience. “I think it’s a wonderful relief that the idea is being presented that we should go back to placing our kids in schools that are the right fit for them. He is debunking the false marketing of colleges, as elite schools are manufacturing these ratios of acceptance,” Stuyvesant parent Terry Rosen said.</p><p>Others believe this lecture was only the beginning of a long battle against tradition. “I think this lecture will have a very small effect because we are up against a huge tradition of pressure to go to name brand schools and by having one talk on one evening with only 400 people in the audience will have a tiny effect. The pressure to go to the most exclusive schools you can go to which has been built up over 20 or 30 years is not going to change very much in one night, but it’s a start,” Venderbush said.</p><p>After the lecture, a question and answer session took place between the audience and Bruni, questioning some of the ideas presented in Bruni’s argument. In one case, junior Roz Joyce asked Bruni whether there was a difference in the caliber of peers in elite and non-elite universities. Bruni responded by stating that in many cases less regarded colleges have a more diverse population, creating a better environment for a student. Bruni went on to say that because students at these elite universities have become so accustomed to receiving opportunities, the level of their interest and appreciation of certain academic benefits is not as prominent.</p><p>Despite the controversy, Bruni stood by his point that although college is important, it is not a deciding factor in a person’s career. “We’re defining best in one way. Were completely equating exclusivity with quality. And that’s just nuts,” Bruni said.</p>	105	13	\N	2015-04-17 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 19:51:32.28968	1	1	New York Times columnist visited school to talk about college admissions.
372	Behind the Extreme Temperatures in the Gyms	behind-the-extreme-temperatures-in-the-gyms	<p>The inconsistency in temperatures in Stuyvesant’s gymnasiums has been an ongoing cause of complaint among physical education teachers and students. There are concerns that such facilities may breed discomfort and inhibit motivation and potential. Issues with building infrastructure and technological malfunctions have been discovered to be the cause of these problems.</p><p>The third floor gymnastics gymnasium is often reported to be excessively cold, despite being separated from the third floor main gym, which is often reported to be extremely hot, by only a dividing wall. The sixth floor gymnasium has also reported to be extremely hot at times. These temperature variations can impede athletic performance and can put students’ health at risk. “When it gets too hot it could be a serious problem,” physical education teacher Howard Barbin said. “I try to modify the activities and I let students bring water. We really don’t want to take away any physical activity, but we try not to push them too hard, because overexertion can be dangerous.”</p><p>The root cause of the issue can be traced back to the construction of the new Stuyvesant High School building in 1992. Structural errors that occurred during this construction period led to problematic air ventilation pathways that contributed to the drastic temperature differences. Moreover, air conditioning and heating units were not initially situated in areas that we deem necessary today. Therefore, some of the units are older than others and, as a result, less effective.</p><p>When an air conditioning unit or other associated aspects break down, the custodians can fill a request form for repair by the DOE’s (Department of Education) Division of School Facilities (DSF). “We make repairs with either DOE staff or outside contractors‎ depending on the job. Borough Maintenance Planners at DSF assign the work in the most efficient manner,” DSF Chief Executive Officer John Shea said in an e-mail interview. However, the DSF prioritizes issues that present an immediate danger to the health and safety of students.</p><p>In order to fully resolve the issue, new heating and cooling units would have to be purchased. The administration needs funding from the DOE as well, in the form of grants. These grants have been requested and are currently pending approval. “We have to follow procedure and [gain approval] from the DOE and the building department in order for us to act upon these issues and make effective change,” Principal Jie Zhang said.</p><p>However, at its annual Spring Feast fundraiser, the Stuyvesant Parent Association (PA) in correspondence with Zhang, has moved forward and acquired funds for replacement air conditioning units. Additionally, the school is beginning to notify the DSF in order for change to be implemented as soon as possible, although the administration is unsure of when exactly these changes will be enacted as they rely on the DSF for much of this implementation.</p><p>Zhang recognizes the importance of the issue and continues to take steps towards addressing the extreme temperatures. “Improving the temperature issue by installing air conditioning and heating units [is] definitely at the top of my agenda,” she said. “The only thing we can do at the moment to accommodate student is to allow the custodians to handle the situation [with the DOE].”</p>	105	14	\N	2015-05-06 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 19:54:30.162637	1	1	
375	CityMD CEO Richard Park Visits Stuyvesant	citymd-ceo-richard-park-visits-stuyvesant	<p>“You’re at Stuyvesant,” Dr. Richard Park (’90), Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at CityMD and Emergency Medicine physician, said. “You guys are capable and healthy. I can’t tell you how important that is.” Over 150 students gathered on Tuesday, November 10 to listen to Dr. Park as he chronicled the founding of CityMD and why he established a motto of “kindness” as the basis of his business. Dr. Park’s visit was organized by the Stuyvesant Pre-Medical Society and hosted by junior and president Evelyn Gotlieb and sophomore and vice president Sofiya Tsenter.  </p><p>Dr. Park began his lecture by emphasizing that financial circumstances should not determine the opportunities a student is provided. After Dr. Park graduated from Stuyvesant, he chose to take a gap year before attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania due to financial difficulties. He described how he felt isolated from his peers because while they were financially-able to attend college, he had to open his own business, a one-hour photo store. Throughout college, Dr. Park commuted from his Pennsylvania dorm to the store every weekend to pay for his education.</p><p>After graduating from Wharton and later completing medical school, Park began his Emergency Medicine residency at Long Island Jewish Hospital. Following his residency, however, Dr. Park was met with the challenges of raising an autistic and nonverbal child. His experiences have led him to establish the premise of kindness for himself and all that he pursues. Though he knows his children will always rely on him in a way non-autistic children would not, he is able to recognize the effects kindness can have on anyone. Dr. Park felt obliged to spread kindness in its simplest forms and carry along this initiative in the creation of CityMD in 2010.  “When you appreciate people and you love people, you can do amazing things. You can do more than you ever knew you could,” Dr. Park said.</p><p>Currently, there are 48 CityMD locations, with a projected 52 by the end of 2015. CityMD locations specialize in urgent care, providing immediate and affordable medical care for people of all ages. Though Dr. Park does not intend to remain CEO since he does not have his Masters in Business Administration, he wants to use his current position to properly communicate and establish a mission statement of serving people with kindness. “The company you create, anything you create, is your artwork. It is a reflection of who you are and your values,” he said.</p><p>Dr. Park recounted his experience with a patient who came into the CityMD in Astoria in excruciating pain, delaying his treatment since he did not have health insurance. CityMD treated the patient free of charge, and he left smiling. “For a few minutes, by saying the procedure was on the house, the world wasn’t broken, and that’s what we all have to do, just spread kindness. Life is tough enough; [we should] make it a little bit easier for someone else,” Dr. Park said. “We didn’t solve any long-term problems here. But for a minute, everything was okay.”</p><p>He went on to explain his philosophy of serving others as crucial to a prosperous career. Dr. Park referenced numerous instances in which the charity of others helped him when he was struggling. Upon renting the first office of CityMD, Dr. Park applied for bankruptcy, until the landowner of the building and now close friend Al Glick, gave him a $300,000 loan, in order to help keep the business afloat.</p><p>However, he acknowledged that revenue must exist in order for CityMD to succeed in the long-term. As an example, he mentioned the creation of the Jackson Heights’ CityMD location, which originally had lost $3,000,000. A result of dedication and hard work, the location is now able to sustain itself and contribute to the revenue of the company.</p><p>Dr. Park explained the growth of CityMD as a combination of timing, luck, and good partners. His passion for his work was a large factor as well. Dedication to his company led to expansion and success, even through hardship. “The only way you can do that, to go the extra mile, is because you love something,” he said.</p><p>Park hopes that his lecture provided an eye-opening experience for students. “It was an opportunity to share the struggles I had growing up and to encourage [students] to have the correct mission and goals in life. People aren’t motivated correctly. This lecture was a reminder to the students as well as myself,” Dr. Park said.</p><p>The Pre-Medical Society feels that Dr. Park accomplished this goal. “Dr. Park’s message conveyed that CityMD is successful because it appreciates and cares for people, serves them instead of taking from them,” Gotlieb said. “Dr. Park wants all prospective doctors to go into the medical field having a love for people and the intention to perpetuate kindness, even in the simple acts of our daily routines.”</p>	106	6	\N	2015-12-02 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 19:56:20.799346	1	1	
377	﻿Dr. Oliveri Replaces Ubieta as AP Language	dr-oliveri-replaces-ubieta-as-ap-language	<p>Former Assistant Principal (AP) of World Languages Arlene Ubieta resigned from her position in late August after accepting a new role in the Language Department at one of the Department of Education’s (DOE) District Offices in Queens. Interim Acting (IA) AP of World Languages Dr. Ernest Oliveri has taken her place.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri was the AP of Security and the AP of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program (which included their language program), at Washington Irving High School, an underperforming school that closed in 2015.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri discovered his interest in world languages when he began to learn the language of his family’s heritage, Italian, in college. “My parents are Italian. They didn’t speak Italian in the home. I heard it in my grandparents’ home,” he said. “When I went to University I studied Italian, and when I graduated college, I got myself a Euro-pass and I traveled to Italy, just me and my Italian. I fell in love with it, it’s a beautiful country and a beautiful language.”</p><p>Dr. Oliveri continued his language studies after college, building on his high school Spanish when he met his wife. “I married a Spaniard,” he said. “It was really an affair of the heart that brought me back to the study of language.”</p><p>At Stuyvesant, Dr. Oliveri will be teaching the new fifth-year Spanish elective, Great Films From the Spanish Speaking World. “One of the ways I improved my Spanish was by looking at Spanish films. One time I got ahold of a [Spanish] film and I looked at the film for three months with the script in my hand,” he said. “[Films are] a very good way to learn [a] language and it really helped my fluency.”</p><p>Dr. Oliveri also hopes to expand the language opportunities offered to students. He created a fourth-year Latin class because an Advanced Placement Latin course will not be offered this year. Moreover, he is arranging a Japanese film festival with Japanese teacher Chie Helinski.</p><p>“There are other ways to learn a language in a culture other than being in a classroom. There are dimensions to a language [other] than learning to conjugate verbs and learning vocabulary. There is culture and I would like to expand that [at Stuyvesant],” he said.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri will maintain his interim status until the DOE’s C-30 process for permanent hiring is completed. Under this process, an AP candidate must be approved by both IA Principal Eric Contreras and Superintendent Marisol Bradbury.</p><p>Ultimately, Dr. Oliveri hopes to be accessible to both the students and the staff. “I hope the students will feel free to come in and share their highs and lows with me,” he said. “It is my job to help them through that and [I want to establish] the same [relationship] with the staff.”</p><p><hr></p><p><i>Additional reporting done by Julia Ingram</i></p>	107	1	\N	2017-09-09 22:57:55.149	2017-12-28 20:32:34.771313	1	1	
390	﻿The Issue with Sanctuary Cities	the-issue-with-sanctuary-cities	<p>The verdict of Zarate’s case emphasizes failures not only in the obstruction of justice, but also in the foundation of some of these very cities.</p><p>Almost two years ago in San Francisco, Kate Steinle was walking with her father and a family friend when she was shot and killed by illegal immigrant Jose Zarate. Zarate, Steinle’s murderer, had been released from jail only three months after the shooting, despite being requested by federal authorities to be detained for deportation long beforehand.</p><p>The trial finally took place a month ago, with a shocking verdict: Zarate walked away charged with solely the possession of a firearm and involuntary manslaughter, as opposed to first or second degree murder. His defense team had argued that Zarate found the gun along the pier, and it “just fired,” a story that the jury bought entirely. Despite his extensive rap sheet, proof that the gun was stolen, and the prosecution’s assurances that the shots were deliberate, Zarate was officially acquitted.</p><p>This incident has since reignited the controversy over America’s immigration policy: particularly the issue with sanctuary cities. True to their moniker, these safe havens for illegal aliens limit how much local law enforcement can comply with federal immigration authorities. San Francisco, for example, passed an ordinance in 1989 which prohibits city employees from complying with I.C.E. workers unless absolutely mandated by law. Many cities across the U.S., such as Newark, East Orange, and Jersey City, have since followed suit, and despite outrage from many right-wing politicians, they have stubbornly kept their compliance with I.C.E. agents minimal.</p><p>Jose Zarate was one of many undocumented immigrants taking advantage of the policy in sanctuary cities. However, his circumstance isn’t unique. A 2005 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the cases of over 55,000 illegal immigrants incarcerated in federal, state or local prisons. It was found that roughly half of them were previously convicted of a felony, a fifth had been arrested for drug offenses, and they had been arrested an average of seven times each.</p><p>A more recent 2011 GAO report details more of a similar trend. The criminal histories of about 251,000 illegal immigrants showed they committed close to three million criminal offenses. Though these numbers are smaller than that of incarcerated naturalized-citizens, they outweigh the latter disproportionately. According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the violent crime rate in sanctuary cities exceeds that of non-sanctuary cities. This discrepancy can be chalked up to such a leniency toward the law that encourages residents to silently accept this excessive restraint of justice. People who are already prone to breaking the law are essentially told there are little to no repercussions, and it’s their statuses as illegal immigrants that allow them to embrace such a culture.</p><p>Repeated offenders also tend to put a strain on law enforcement, forsaking both their lives and the extent to which they can exercise authority. After multiple repeat offenses, the danger of keeping these people within society is pervasive, and the options police are given to deal with the issue are lacking. In lieu of deportation (which the crimes of many of these illegal immigrants are more than deserving of), police and law enforcement officials are forced to waste resources and manpower on the same criminals time and time again.</p><p>Not only does this jeopardize the safety of residents of sanctuary cities, it also imposes costs they shouldn’t have to bear. The incarceration of illegal aliens alone (according to the same study) costs about $1.6 billion annually from fiscal years 2005 to 2009, and this number is only continuing to rise. These same tax dollars ought to be properly put to use for residents who paid them, but are instead forced to be used toward services for people who aren’t entitled to them in the first place.</p><p>Steinle’s murder sheds light on some of these complications, motivating Congress to pen “Kate’s Law,” a piece of legislation that increases the penalties for deported persons who return to the U.S. and get caught. While the House managed to pass this legislation, a federal judge has recently blocked President Trump’s executive order to deny funding to sanctuary cities, deeming it unconstitutional. The judge even went as far as to say, “Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves.”</p><p>But cutting funding isn’t the only way for the Trump administration to get sanctuary cities to help with the deportation of illegal immigrants who’ve proved incompetent at complying with American standards. Several counties defy even the bare minimum amount of cooperation with the law, such as instructing police to never ask for someone’s immigration status or even setting up defense funds for illegal immigrants paid for through taxes.</p><p>These sorts of actions tip-toe across the line between “lawful” and “unlawful” far too often. Enabling them to persist only solidifies a dangerous sentiment, allowing cities to persistently evade policies. And though Trump’s actions were certainly misguided, his administration had valid intentions. Sanctuary cities are an outdated way of combating America’s immigration policy, and sensible restrictions must be placed regarding their unwillingness to cooperate with the federal law. Prosecutors should not be allowed to drop criminal charges against undocumented immigrants for risk of deportation, and extremely limited government assistance should be given to individuals who exhibit no regard for the law over and over again.</p><p>Allowing sanctuary cities to continue existing in the U.S. as they do now only breeds this innate disrespect for the law. The verdict of Zarate’s case emphasizes failures not only in the obstruction of justice, but also in the foundation of some of these very cities. Steinle’s fate has managed to shed a national spotlight on the recklessness of their approach toward illegal aliens who don’t uphold the law. It needs to be made clear that America won’t stand for it any longer.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:34:16.330959	2018-01-23 02:34:16.943034	2	1	Sanctuary cities are an outdated way of combating America’s immigration policy, and sensible restrictions must be placed regarding their unwillingness to cooperate with the federal law.
414	﻿Humor Editors Flabbergasted as Writers Actually Decided to Write	humor-editors-flabbergasted-as-writers-actually-decided-to-write	<p>The Humor Department of The Spectator is known for being a very lacking department, both in content and, ironically, humor. The number of articles it publishes every issue hovers slightly above the number of Stuyvesant students who get more than ten hours of sleep per week, which reached a record low this winter due to rumors of harsher anti-cheating policies. Therefore, it was not a surprise when junior and Humor editor Kerwin Chen became dumbfounded as the department writers decided to actually write articles.</p><p>“I just couldn’t believe my eyes as I logged onto my [Humor Department] e-mail,” said Chen. “People were actually signing up to write articles! Previously, the only person who wrote was [senior and Humor editor] Michael Xu, sometimes under the pen names ‘Benedict Ho’ or ‘Angelique Charles-Davis’ to make it seem like our department was functional, but I saw so many new names like ‘Tony Moh’ and ‘Victor Kuang’ that I knew it couldn’t be all Michael because he’s been too busy working on his Harvard app to write eight humor articles.”</p><p>Xu also commented on this surprising phenomenon. “I thought The Great Laszlo was playing a prank on us and writing articles, but a quick look at the low writing quality after the articles were written immediately ruled out that possibility. We are entering a new era; an era where we can finally surpass the long-loved Sports Department and reach the top of the Spec ladder, where the Opinions Department resides.”</p><p>When asked about adjusting to the new editing load, neither Humor editor was fazed. “It doesn’t matter if we have one or 20 articles,” Chen said. “I don’t even bother editing [the articles] anymore. No one reads the Humor section anyway.”</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:57:46.167685	2018-01-23 02:57:46.274516	5	1	The Humor editors are surprised after finding out that their department writers are actually signing up to write.
418	﻿The Peglegs Looking to Make Comeback	the-peglegs-looking-to-make-comeback	<p>With an aggressive return,  junior and co-captain Allison Eng ended her third round against her opponent from Tottenville High School. It was the girls’ varsity table tennis team’s first match since losing to Millennium High School.</p><p>The Peglegs ended up winning 4-1 against Tottenville High School in spite of a loss during first doubles. In singles matches, all three starters, junior and co-captain Katherine Lee, Eng, and sophomore Kasey Chan, had a rocky start, maintaining a marginal lead in their first respective games. However, in the following rounds after they’d warmed up, it became clear that nerves were responsible for their initial slip up. Instead of leading by only four points, it was by up to eight points for all three players. Lee, Eng, and Chan all won decisively, three games to none. In doubles, despite the Peglegs’ best efforts, they lost one out of their two matches, partly due to the fact that one of their starters was absent that day. “Some matches were a breeze but parts of our team need to do better in terms of giving away less points due to simple mistakes,” Eng said.</p><p>The team was recovering from a loss before winter break to Millennium High School, the current reigning champion of the Division I League. It was their second time being beat 5-0, so team spirit was at an all-time low. Their record after their game against Tottenville is 8-2, and they are currently second place in their League.</p><p>A player’s attitude and mindset going into a game is often the determining factor when the teams are evenly matched and just as important even if they aren’t. Coach Eric Wisotsky believes that the reason for their defeat stems from a lack of self-confidence and team morale. “The girls tend to get nervous even though they’re good enough to beat them. Skill-wise, they’re at the same level,” Wisotsky said. A look at game statistics of the Peglegs and Millennium match shows that the teams were fairly on par with each other with Eng losing 3-2 and a doubles duo of freshman Alyssa Yoo and Divya Chanani also losing 3-2.</p><p>Other than Millennium, no team so far this season has been able to seriously contend with the Peglegs for a spot in playoffs. “We still hope to make it far into the season into semifinals, and hopefully top 4, like last year. [It] hasn’t been as bad as we thought it would be without the seniors,” Eng said. The captains have worked hard thus far to maintain a similar record to that of last year’s despite the enormous gap the seniors of last year have left.</p><p>The team is looking to build themselves up again, so that even if they aren’t victorious this season, they will be next year. With the amount of sheer potential in the majority underclassmen and continuous drilling, the Peglegs hope to become an even more formidable force in PSAL and restore their title as champions. Especially now that the players have access to more newly purchased tables, bought in order for Stuyvesant to host the City Championships, they’ll be able to practice more. “While we might not beat Millennium this year because it requires multiple team members getting better in little time, our team [still] has years to improve,” Eng said.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:59:53.060766	2018-01-23 02:59:53.175951	24	1	After a hard loss to Millennium High School, the Peglegs are looking to bounce back with a win against Tottenville High School.
419	﻿Titans Lose First Game in Four Years	titans-lose-first-game-in-four-years	<p>After some extremely competitive back-and-forth rallies, first singles and senior Alvin Chen was winning 2-1. It was match point, during which Chen could win the whole match and give his team the much sought-after win. While the ball was in midair, he took a step back and wound up his arm and swung his hardest, hitting the ball with extreme speed. However, his opponent from Brooklyn Technical High School, Gabriel Riskevich hit the ball twice as fast. Riskevich came back to win the game and the next one, winning the entire match, 3 games to Chen’s 2.</p><p>The Stuyvesant Titans, the boys’ table tennis team, has lost one game in the last five years to Brooklyn Technical Engineers, their all-time rivals. Before their last game on January 9, they had an ongoing win streak that spanned over 60 games, which is the majority of coach Bernard Feigenbaum’s entire career with the team.</p><p>At the end of their regular season, the Titans placed first in the Central Division, consisting of teams in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, with a record of 11-1. They shut out every team other than the Engineers (5-0) effortlessly.</p><p>The team has won all its scheduled matches this season. Senior and captain Isaac Rose Berman and his doubles partner, senior Nicholas Pustilnik, have won all of their matches this season, along with second singles junior Mark Amstislavskiy. Because Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Technical High School are so evenly matched, it just takes a few points to change the direction of the score. “We need either first singles or second doubles to win [against Brooklyn Tech]. Alvin came close [to Riskevich] in first singles, [and] it gave me confidence [that] Alvin could win [his game] in cities,” coach Feigenbaum said.</p><p>The Titans will likely face Brooklyn Tech again in the final round of the playoffs, as they are the two best teams in the PSAL. The Titans have overcome a lot to reach where they are today: they started a new season without the core three, Alston Wang (‘17), William Yao (‘17) and Eric Amstislavskiy (‘17), a group of seniors who led the team to four consecutive trophies. They’ve hit a rough bump with their most recent regular season game, but still have high hopes for a fifth consecutive championship. One regular season loss does not make or break a season.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 03:00:07.233965	2018-01-23 03:00:07.347381	24	1	Though the Stuyvesant Boys’ Table Tennis team, the Titans, was dealt their first loss in 5 years, ending their 60+ game win streak, they still hope to win their fifth consecutive title in Coach Feigenbaum’s last year.

They currently hold a fourth place standing in the Bronx/Manhattan division, one that they held last year as well, missing third place by less than a point. The team has won all but one meet to the Bronx High School of Science, the team’s longtime rival, with a final score of 99.3-102.6. The Felines also lost to Bronx Science at their divisional meet with a total score of 103.3, putting them in second place behind Bronx Science’s score of 115.97.</p><p>Despite losing several key seniors who graduated last year, the team has remained on its feet. In their first meet of the season, the lineup was composed predominantly of returning junior and senior athletes, other than freshman Naomi Khanna. “Because the first meet was only about a month and week after the season started, it would be asking too much for any newer girls or less experienced girls to be ready for a competition,” Coach Vasken Choubaralian said.</p><p>As the season continued, however, newer gymnasts have been participating in events as well. “We're really lucky to have experienced freshmen Naomi Khanna and Anya Zorin and junior Leah Rosenthal join the team to make up for the three [graduated] seniors,” senior and co-captain Annie Lee said. “Coach Choubaralian always wants to give less experienced girls a chance to compete.”</p><p>With Khanna as a strong all-around player and Rosenthal and Zorin obtaining between sevens in the balance beam and vaulting events respectively, the team is using its new members to its advantage and helping to prepare them for next year when some of the strongest players, like senior Anna Pacheco and Lee, graduate.</p><p>The team is practicing on fixing more minor errors, where they tend to lose a lot of points. “We're working on really perfecting all our routines because in gymnastics, we get deducted for the smallest details like flexed feet and bent legs,” Lee said. While almost all of the Felines have been participating in multiple events at different meets this season, nearing the end, the team is going to be relying on the returning members.</p><p>“As we near the finals, my veterans and my experienced gymnasts will be competing, especially in the finals,” Coach Choubaralian said.</p><p>The team hopes to maintain its current fourth place position in the city. While replacing the Bronx High School of Science in third place has always been the team’s goal, it will require a major comeback after the initial loss of more than 12 points to Science. However, they haven’t lost hope and still have several remaining meets. “I’m really proud of what we’ve gotten to and achieved so far in the year, and I’m looking forward to a successful and progressive rest of the the season,” junior and co-captain Lee-Ann Rushlow said. With Science having had success in their season thus far, the Felines have their work cut out for them if they hope to catch any teams in front of them in the division.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 03:00:58.783477	2018-01-23 03:00:58.89126	24	1	
411	﻿“Administration Enforces Sleep”	administration-enforces-sleep	<p>Despite the recent 10-day break, students were returning to school feeling drowsy. With over 98.7 percent of students sleeping in class, many teachers got fed up and were left unable to teach their classes.</p><p>“I’ve literally never seen anything like this,” geometry teacher David Peng said.</p><p>“When I randomly wake someone up, it’s like they’ve forgotten what a proof is. This has gotten so out of hand that I had to reteach them what a triangle is.”</p><p>Seeing the administration’s growing desperation to solve this problem, freshman Emma Tong came up with a plan that she believed would benefit thousands of students in Stuyvesant.</p><p>A few days later, Tong decided to talk to Principal Eric Contreras about her plan. Though skeptical at first, Contreras grew increasingly interested in the plan over time.</p><p>“It’s actually quite genius, you know,” Contreras remarked. “All we have to do is enforce eight hours of sleep a night, and all of our problems will be solved. The students will love us for giving them so much sleep, and the school can finally resume the plan of brainwashing them. We’ll just dock half a point off their overall average if they sleep for less than eight hours. That would scare them silly. Eventually, we’ll have well-rested and energetic students for the first time in Stuyvesant’s history. It’s perfect!”</p><p>Despite mandating all students to get a healthy amount of sleep, this did not have the desired effect that the administration had initially hoped for. The policy has had no lasting effect thus far due to the difficulty of enforcing it and was quickly met by negative feedback from students and teachers alike.</p><p>“Not only have my grades suffered, but it’s basically impossible to get eight hours of sleep considering the amount of time that we spend on Facebook,” sophomore Ruby Huang said.</p><p>“I have no idea what the staff was doing when it implemented this policy,” Algebra 2 teacher Aziz Jumash said. “The kids are supposed to cry over their impossible homework every night, not sleep.”</p><p>Though the policy continues to get all sorts of negative feedback, the administration will continue attempting to enforce sleep until every Stuyvesant student can function in class again.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 02:57:22.052237	2018-01-23 02:57:22.171926	5	1	
422	﻿Despite Challenges, Pirates Dominate Early On	despite-challenges-pirates-dominate-early-on	<p>Sophomore Kai Yamamoto stepped up to his lane. He sprung off the starting block, already ahead of his competitors. It was a routine two laps for Yamamoto, who finished four seconds ahead of his teammate, freshman Karl Chen, and almost 10 seconds ahead of the fourth place competitor from James Monroe Campus. Yamamoto’s success in the 100-yard butterfly was one of many from Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity swimming & diving team, the Pirates, who extended a lengthy streak of regular season victories with a decisive 52-38 win over Campus on January 10.</p><p>These kinds of victories are nothing new for the Pirates, who have commanded the Bronx/Manhattan League for years now, with the last three seasons providing a combined regular season record of 23-0. Their divisional dominance also spills into their playoff performances: a championship run coming last year and losses in the championship rounds the two years before that. Both of these losses were to the Brooklyn Technical High School Engineers, which has resulted in a developing rivalry between the two teams. Many of the swimmers who were on the team two or three years ago are eager to once again compete with their rivals. “I remember losing to Brooklyn Tech my freshman year and how hard it was for the seniors to lose four times in a row. After that the whole team, even the rookies, [has] been extremely motivated. And while we still have this rivalry with Brooklyn Tech, we are confident we can [and] will win the championship this year,” junior Axel Tolpina said. This motivation has clearly paid off, as demonstrated by last year’s championship.</p><p>The Pirates hope to defend their title this year, but they have to compensate for the missing talent of last year’s seniors. This year, there are only five seniors and 13 underclassmen. Nonetheless, the team has faith in many of its underclassmen. Freshman Osmond Wan and Yamamoto have been very consistent this season, placing first or second in almost every event they’ve swam in, including the 100-yard freestyle and the 200-yard individual medley. “All of our new recruits this year have an overall great work ethic, which shows in their performance during practices and at meets. Yamamoto continues to put out fast times and win his events in our dual meets,” senior and co-captain Derek Tran said.</p><p>The upperclassmen core has also remained very solid, with co-captain seniors Derek Tran and Leon Lai as well as junior Nicholas Wen placing first in almost every event they’ve swam in this season, from the 200-yard individual medley to the 100-yard butterfly.</p><p>Another obstacle has been a coaching change. Coach Silvana Choy took over the role of former girls and boys swimming coach Peter Bologna, as a result of his new position as Stuyvesant’s Athletic Director. This was a very sudden and unexpected adjustment for the Pirates, who have seen deep playoff runs year after year thanks to former coach Bologna. “The biggest change [has been] our new head coach, Coach Choy. She took the position without prior knowledge about our swimmers, and we also did not know what to expect heading into this season. Throughout the first few weeks, we had to earn each other's trust and respect. She definitely runs things differently than former Coach Bologna, but they are both equally committed to this team. Even during this transition, we've still been able to remain a tight-knit community, and we fully trust Coach Choy,” Tran said.</p><p>A coaching transition is always something that can be a major factor in a team’s success, but the Pirates have stayed true to their dominance over the Bronx/Manhattan League under Coach Choy. So far, the Pirates have once again maintained an undefeated regular season record of 6-0 and look to clinch back-to-back championships by relying on their strong upperclassmen core and rapidly developing underclassmen roster.</p>	108	8	\N	2018-01-20 03:02:10.792425	2018-01-23 03:02:10.990584	24	1	Briefly discussing the Pirates’ successes and shortcoming in recent years while focusing on key areas that affect their chances at another championship run.
425	﻿Mandatory Volunteerism: Not an Oxymoron	mandatory-volunteerism-not-an-oxymoron	<p>They say we are young people who are learning to think like adults. We haul ourselves out of bed at six in the morning every weekend and clumsily throw on our suits and polish our dress shoes. We are expected to use our “gifted tongues” to discuss how to create stability and foster citizenship in the seemingly messy world we live in today.</p><p>As high school debaters, we come equipped to each tournament ready to comment on our “constituents” in developing nations and our plan to fix the “socioeconomic instability” that we witness daily. We absorb the praise that is thrown at us by our teachers, coaches, and tournament directors for doing so.</p><p>Yet, it has become clear that our service only exists when it means we can take home another trophy to display. Often, we, the ones with the “gifted tongues,” ignore the homeless man we see every day begging for food, or the underprivileged students being forced to learn in run-down schools. We have become accustomed to viewing ourselves on a moral high ground, while not fully understanding what it means to take action.</p><p>In some areas of the United States, volunteering is now becoming a graduation requirement. According to Reason Magazine, mandatory volunteerism trains students to notice community problems, analyze them, and then take part in resolving them. This teaches students that it isn’t only their responsibility to comment on the issues that surround them, but also to play an active role in improving the lives of those who face these issues.</p><p>If educators hope to raise a generation of selfless, responsible, and active citizens who are genuinely committed to servicing their communities, they will need to emphasize the importance of interactions between volunteers and those they help.</p><p>Many critics of compulsory volunteerism cite studies that examine the insincere intentions of participants. These critics maintain that only those who want to volunteer should be doing so. Yet, even without these requirements, many students volunteer for the mere purpose of checking off a box on their college applications; in other words, this is a problem that already exists, not a problem that will be born as a result of mandatory volunteerism.</p><p>Under a mandate, the practices of college-driven students, as well as the practices of students who volunteer because they simply want to give back, will remain relatively unaffected. On the other hand, students who would not have otherwise become involved in community service will be exposed to the social and educational benefits of volunteering.</p><p>Moreover, mandatory volunteering can be a means by which participants can positively change their own attitudes. According to a National Longitudinal Study of Youth, volunteering has shown to be effective in discouraging students from participating in illicit activities, because it occupies their time productively.</p><p>By making volunteerism a graduation requirement, educators are taking the first step towards fostering citizenship among students. Maybe one day, we can possess more than “gifted tongues,” and can turn abstract ideas into concrete actions.</p>	107	2	\N	2017-09-30 22:25:05.320483	2018-01-23 22:25:05.655011	2	1

7	390	281	While the point of this article is to show how sanctuary city policies act as catalysts for crime, the intention of said legislation is to reduce it by removing the threat of deportation for illegal immigrants who observe crimes being committed. The author may be completely right about the issue and is all too willing to use basic data in support of her argument but isn't willing to do so for the other side of the argument (here's an example: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soc4.12547/full) let alone address it. I don't have any strong opinions of the issue, but it's disappointing that this kind of unnuanced wingnuttery goes unfiltered by the Spec.	2018-01-28 03:06:47.336951	2018-01-28 03:06:47.336951	\N

It really is scary to put yourself out there, but it’s also most important that you advocate for your community.”	2017-11-22 01:37:52.901287	2017-11-22 01:37:52.901287

As an institution that is held to the highest standards of honesty and reliability, it is the government's duty to support its scientists, not undermine them.	2017-11-22 01:44:49.49367	2017-11-22 01:44:49.49367
13	10	While those with political power should be making evidence-based claims and supporting scientific progress, Trump’s blatant attempts to stir up hysteria over baseless facts reflect an inappropriate relationship he and his administration currently hold with the country.	2017-11-22 01:44:49.543363	2017-11-22 01:44:49.543363

18	15	“Labelling makeup, popular feminine clothing, and other girl-oriented culture ‘basic’ fuels the old stereotypes that girls are simple, all alike, and not to be taken seriously.”	2017-11-22 01:46:55.620504	2017-11-22 01:46:55.620504

53	45	From their questionable style trends to their signature makeup tutorials, beauty gurus have helped us become desensitized to the practices that would have once resulted in reverberating culture shock.	2017-11-22 02:07:15.474157	2017-11-22 02:07:15.474157

58	51	The addition of an elite two-way player and an able point guard to a team with two players, shooting guard Andrew Wiggins and center Karl-Anthony Towns, who are both under 23 but combine for 50 or 60 points almost every game makes Minnesota a true powerhouse, at least on paper.	2017-11-22 02:14:24.938802	2017-11-22 02:14:24.938802

284	287	Politicians are too frightened to set a precedent, but as soon as “supporting women’s rights” is more than just a mantra, they can finally start uniting the American people.	2017-12-21 17:45:56.445166	2017-12-21 17:45:56.445166

289	295	Ultimately, her direct declaration of her expectations in the relationship—to be the “end game”—unveils a new depth and a change in Taylor, who seems to be taking increased control in her own fate, breaking from the helplessness of her former self.	2017-12-21 18:05:34.922085	2017-12-21 18:05:34.922085

Students lined up beside tables covered in multi-color tablecloths, in the hopes of partaking in arts-and-crafts activities or viewing poster boards.</p><p>The Earth Day Fair focuses on a specific environmental issue each year, and this year’s topic was American environmental policy. Members of the Environmental Club worked in groups to create presentations, with topics ranging from oil drilling to the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. “[The Earth Day Fair’s goal] is to raise awareness in Stuyvesant so our  students can go out there and make a change in the society through their voices,” sophomore and Environmental Club secretary Kenny Wong said.</p><p>After investigating water regulatory policies such as the Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants in certain waters, freshman and Environmental Club member Derek Lao became quite familiar with the subject. “I believe that the US has taken amazing actions to make sure the quality of our water is in check,” he said. “However, there are still bodies of waters in the United States that are hazardous due to the amount of pollutants [and] I feel that more can still be done.”</p><p>This kind of information was shared with attendees of the fair both through Club members’ presentations and through other activities.         “One of the highlights of the fair was the seed planting. [...] It's a great experience to learn how to plant,” freshman George Zhou said.</p><p>The fair also included entertainment such as a StuyFlow demonstration and a student juggling performance.</p><p>The Environmental Club hopes to improve upon the fair next year. “We weren’t looking to partner with other clubs this year, [but] that would be our idea next year,” Wong said.</p><p>In the meantime, the Environmental Club has many other events planned to raise awareness and improve the environment. These initiatives include terracycle bins, the billion oysters project, a rooftop garden, and a toner recycle program.</p>	Article	173	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 06:07:52.451138
882	﻿Academic Dishonesty: The Teacher’s View  <p><h4>Lauren Stuzin, English</h4></p><p><b>What’s your perception of cheating, especially encompassing plagiarism in the English Department?</b></p><p>I would say I haven’t encountered it all that often, which makes me happy, because I think students should rather have ideas of their own than take from online. But I do think that when it does happen it’s mostly because you guys are very overwhelmed and stressed, and there’s only so much time in your days. So while it’s really bad to plagiarize, and no one should do it—you should try to come up with your own ideas—it’s better to have this happen in high school and to learn from it than for it to happen in the future. So I do think it’s a learning experience, and I understand that students can feel overwhelmed with the amount of work at Stuyvesant.</p><p><b>If you catch a student cheating (plagiarizing), what happens?</b></p><p>In the English department if you plagiarise an assignment you’ll receive a zero for that assignment. You’ll also probably have a conversation with the Assistant Principal [Eric] Grossman regarding plagiarism and problems with it, and what constitutes plagiarism. Then, you’re expected to not do that again, and you’ll be able to submit future assignments.</p><p><b>Do you agree with Stuyvesant’s cheating policy?</b></p><p>Yes, I do think it’s important that students are aware of the fact that plagiarizing is a problem, and I think that students are going to need to know in college. And it’s good to know the rules for citation, and also, I think receiving a zero on the assignment you plagiarized is a fair punishment.</p><p><b>Stuyvesant is notorious for cheating—a couple years ago we had the Regents scandal, and last year, we had this scandal in the Spanish Department. What do you think makes cheating unique at Stuy, or so widespread?</b></p><p>I think it’s the fact that Stuyvesant students have way more work than any other school, and I do think at least I try to keep aware of the amount of homework I’m assigning and how long readings are taking—because I don’t want to necessarily add to that work. I don’t want students to feel like my work is busy work, or just taking up time. I want to make sure that what I assign is meaningful, so it doesn’t just add to this burden that you guys feel every day when you go home and have hours and hours of homework ahead of you. I feel like sometimes teachers forget students have lives outside of school and belong to a million extracurriculars. You’re very active in your communities, and you have stuff to do at home.</p><p><b>Have you ever cheated when you were little, like in high school?</b></p><p>I think in high school I probably shared homework. I distinctly remember once in elementary school I ratted someone else out for cheating and I felt really bad about that when I was 11.</p><p><h4>Dr. Jeffrey Kivi</h4></p><p><b>What do you think about cheating? Why do kids do it? What do you do to try to stop cheating from happening?</b></p><p>I give multiple versions of a test to try to limit the temptation because I know that kids, those who weren't even planning on cheating, at the spur of the moment, give in to temptation to look at the test of the student next to them. That’s why I give out multiple tests to illuminate that sort of spontaneous temptation.</p><p>I used to give lots of homework and there are a lot of reasons why I have deemphasized homework but one of the reasons is that kids with the Internet and these groups that they form and they all share everything so easily, so you start to see too much of kids handing in the same homework with the same wording. And it was clear that kids weren't doing their own work and it's like, how do you stop that? And it's pretty much impossible to stop kids using the internet for helping each other out, posting answers, or looking up the answers online. To an extent, giving homework was less useful because kids weren't necessarily doing the answers on their own, they were getting them online. So that’s some of the reasons why I deemphasized it. I'd rather have kids work on something in class so they can think about it and work it out themselves or with their neighbors or teammates rather than looking up the answers that were posted in groups or online.</p><p><b>What do you do when you find a student is cheating?</b></p><p>I don't think about it an awful lot. I leave it up to the administration to deal with overall. I just try to do things that give kids less of an opportunity make the wrong choice and hopefully encourage them to solve things on their own.</p><p><h4>Dr. Susan Barrow</h4></p><p><b>What are your experiences with cheating?</b></p><p>My experience teaching mostly Art Appreciation with freshmen is that I never worried about them cheating. I did have an experience a couple of years ago where I thought that I was vigilant, but I had classes in the morning, and a student in the afternoon had informed me that students in the cafeteria were looking at a copy of my test on Facebook. I had to involve [Assistant Principal of Security, Health, and Physical Education Brian] Moran, and I gave the student a chance to reflect on this instance. A couple of people named the same person as the perpetrator anonymously.</p><p><b>What are your methods of stopping cheating? In tests and homework?</b></p><p>I collect any phones before any test I give. Phones are out in a box. Honestly, I don't think that students understand what plagiarism is or isn't. They don't, especially freshmen, they have no clear understanding of it, the administration does a better job explaining it to them. For museum reports, I ask students to make a personal statement that says they didn't copy, they didn't plagiarize, so I think that if anyone has any integrity, they should learn when they’re young and that's the best I can do. I also walk around constantly during tests.</p><p><b>Why do you think students cheat?</b></p><p>They cheat because they don’t think they will be caught. I think that students in this school are under pressure to get good grades and the best way possible, unfortunately, is cheating, and some of them think that if they get a bad grade, it ruins their whole life or something.</p><p><b>What are your consequences for anyone caught cheating?</b></p><p>I think that students have subtle ways of cheating, but I'm not going to spend the whole day tracking down cheaters. If it's really blatant, I rip up their test or give them a zero, and in cases, not recently, but kids handing in an identical report I call them in, sit them down, and ask why the reports are virtually identical. So then one of them will eventually admit that they copied off the other.</p><p><h4>Marianne Prabhu, Biology</h4></p><p><b>Why do you think students cheat?</b></p><p>I think that students don't even realize that things they do constitute as cheating; for example, copying homework. Some students don’t even think that they’re doing it until we point it out to them.</p><p><b>What are your penalties for cheating?</b></p><p>I've never had a situation where I had to give a student a full zero or something like that. But I know for the most part, our department policy is they get a zero for that assignment.</p><p><b>How do you prevent kids from cheating?</b></p><p>One thing I do is let students use a notes guide, a specific one, on exams. This way, they don't feel like they have to cheat, they already have some of their notes in front of them, and I try to test them more on applications, so there is a lot of writing and it's hard to cheat in the first place.</p><p><h4>Jerry Citron, Biology</h4></p><p><b>Why do you think students cheat?</b></p><p>Students cheat because of a multiple of reasons, primarily stress and also because they want to do something fast and they don't want to study. The other reason students cheat is because maybe the situation in class is not fair in the way they think [it] should be, and they feel that the only way they do well is to cheat.</p><p><b>How do you stop kids from cheating?</b></p><p>There are some students who genuinely do well because they work really really hard on something. And that’s another issue. Some students take easier classes, and therefore have an easier time, and some students take a lot of AP courses and are therefore very stressed out. And I do believe that students cheat because they have five AP classes and they start to prioritize one over another. Like, ”I was able to study for this one, but not this one, but I have exams back to back. I'm going to cheat, or try to cheat.” Some kids have notes on cards, on a piece of paper, some like to write notes on their hands and some will look at other people's paper[s], so to prevent that is to make multiple copies of an exam so that there is an “A,” “B,” “C” version of the exam and that will prevent cheating in class. I walk up and down the aisles to make sure that kids aren't looking at each other’s papers or have any external examples. There are many physical things you can do, but ultimately, any kid who cheats is hurting himself, so that's how I look at it. If you’re going to cheat and do it in a way you think is being successful and you’re not being successful, you’re really just turning on yourself, and ultimately, you don't do very well in school.</p><p><b>What are your consequences for cheating?</b></p><p>If you are caught cheating on tests, you should get a zero, you should absolutely get a zero, that should be the consequence. If you do it again, then the administration should get involved. The really good students may have cheated once or twice. They just know how to manage time, manage the stress in order to learn. And there are other kids who try to circumvent the system.</p><p><b>Do you do anything to help with the stress?</b></p><p>I do test corrections when I can. Curving the exam sometimes helps. Sometimes, if I find a question is horrendous, because most students get it wrong, I just throw it out. That's my fault, not the students’. I'm trying to make it feel like the exam isn't trying to hurt them but to learn information and use it again as a tool to learn what you didn't understand before the test. So if the test can be a tool for learning, if students can see it as a tool, and not as an absolute assessment, then there might be less cheating. I don't know but that's what I'm hoping.</p><p><h4>Eric Grossman, Assistant Principal of English</h4></p><p><b>What do you think about cheating or in the case of the English department, plagiarism? Why do you think that kids do it?</b></p><p>Part of my job is to meet with students and their teachers when plagiarizing occurs. You asked about plagiarism, I'm not a big fan of it. Overwhelmingly, when it happens it happens because students feel overwhelmed and stressed out and panicky and make a bad decision last minute, often late at night, and that's understandable. The goal is to make sure that they learn from it, and while the consequences are meant to resonate, to feel meaningful enough to create an impression, they are not meant to and don't ruin lives or chances to get into a decent college. If it happens chronically, then that is a different story and a different problem.</p><p><b>Can you talk about the consequences?</b></p><p>Well, there is an academic policy of the school and if a student cheats on an assignment, whatever that looks like, if it’s a single line from a website or if it's a cut and paste, it’s still academic dishonesty. So the scale of seriousness rises or falls depending on the size of the assignment and what is sad and ironic is that when a student cheats, their hope is to do better; [however] they do much much worse. We want kids to be successful, we want them to be in structures that encourage and support that.</p><p><b>What methods do you use to stop cheating?</b></p><p>Most teachers develop [a] pretty good “spidey sense” when something appears off. In terms of strategy to discourage it, talking about it and making it clear to our students that we care about it and why we care about is the most important thing. Most students are attuned to their teachers: what they value, what they as students should value, and having those conversation[s] make it less likely to occur. It does not mean that it can never occur, but it’s just communicating what the ideas of the case are and why.</p><p><b>Do you think teachers have ways of making sure that students are working on their assignments?</b></p><p>In a lot of classes, especially in the lower grades, there are multiple due dates of multiple parts of a project. In a [Freshman Composition] class, a thesis may be due a certain day and then they'll workshop it, and passages from a book and supporting evidence may be due a certain day, and by the time the essay is actually due, there are a lot of steps along the way that give a chance for teachers to check in and make sure that students are not saving the entire thing for the night before.</p>	Article	280	2017-12-21 16:29:52.86366	2017-12-21 16:29:52.86366
1002	﻿The Original Twenty-One Pilots, A Deeply Buried Secret Review of the STC winter drama <i>All My Sons</i>. <p>The Stuyvesant Theater Community’s production of Arthur Miller’s classic play, “All My Sons,” directed by senior Mika Simoncelli, sophomore Emily Rubinstein, and freshman Clara Yuste, opens on Joe Keller (senior Alex Whittington) sitting in a lawn chair, reading the newspaper in front of a blue house with yellow windows, a simple white fence, and flowers on the windowsill. The picture-perfect suburban house conjures up the familiarity of the American Dream. But we soon discover that the people inside that house, two parents, their son, and the fiancée of their son who went missing in the war, are anything but serene. They’re each broken, keeping secrets that they’re either too ashamed of or too disturbed by to tell even those who are closest to them.</p><p>Joe’s son Larry, a pilot in the war, has been missing for three years, leaving behind a broken family and distraught fiancée. Joe has to suffer through the consequences of the choices he made in order to keep his business running and to make money for his family, even if those choices mean he is responsible for the deaths of 21 pilots, and that somehow, his son could have been one of them.</p><p>From the opening moment, Whittington remains brilliantly committed to his role as Joe, an aging suburban businessman with a dark secret. Sophomore Zeynep Bromberg is lively and honest as Joe’s wife, Kate Keller. Kate refuses to believe that Larry is dead, because she knows that if he is, it’s Joe’s fault, and she’s incapable of accepting the fact that a father can kill his own son.</p><p>Between a series of small panic attacks and a lot of social manipulation, Kate struggles to prevent Larry’s beautiful fiancée Ann Deever (sophomore Victoria Wong) from marrying her living son Chris (senior Garrett Hall), knowing that their marriage would force her to accept the unthinkable. Kate grasps at Larry’s memory from the people around her, even believing her neighbor Frank Lubey’s (senior Travis Tyson) “horoscope” for Larry proves that he must still be alive somewhere. Bromberg reveals Kate’s pain when she says, of other mothers like her, “They don’t say it on the radio, but I’m sure that in the dark of night they’re still waiting for their sons.”</p><p>The play’s heavy-handed moralizing provides the thread of the plot. While Kate believes Larry must be alive because it’s immoral for a father to have killed his own son, Joe justifies his actions and lies with his own moral compass, saying that nothing in the world is bigger or more important than the relationship between father and son. Therefore, nothing should compromise his relationship with Chris.</p><p>Chris, meanwhile, clearly thinks it wrong to disrespect or distance oneself from one’s parents, but right to marry someone that you love, regardless of the circumstances. That idea goes head-to-head with Kate’s belief that a fiancée should wait for her fiancé unconditionally if he goes missing, and that she should certainly not marry his brother.</p><p>The supporting roles did their part to give the heavy storyline life and energy. Beginning with her funny, energetic entrance as eight-year-old Bert, sophomore Sara Stebbins provided comedic relief. An added laugh came when Ann commented that Frank was losing his hair, because Travis Tyson, with his voluminous head of hair, was playing the part.</p><p>Hall and Wong’s chemistry as Chris and Ann, who become engaged during the play without Kate’s knowledge or Joe’s enthusiasm, provided a framework for most of the scenes, and their kiss drew a substantial reaction from the audience. The direction skillfully brought to light the recognizable story of young love amid the backdrop of a serious setting.</p><p>The cast glided effortlessly through the minor sound inconsistencies typical of student productions, displaying true professionalism. The four neighbors, often emerging from opposite sides of the stage throughout the play, added to the almost eerie American dream illusion.</p><p>On one side of the house, Sue Bayliss (freshman Mimi Gillies) agonizes over her husband’s (sophomore Michael Dekhtyar) desire to sacrifice his career as a doctor to devote his life to scientific research. Much like her neighbor Kate, she shifts abruptly from the typical well-mannered suburban housewife to someone frighteningly controlling and manipulative. Her unbridled desperation to keep her husband Jim in a financially stable career at the cost of his dreams, and the fact that she is willing to force Ann to make Chris leave town in order to prevent him from inspiring Jim too much suggest that she, like Joe, harbors a greedy obsession with money and success.</p><p>Adding to the grim undertone of the play is the tree stump placed to one side of the Kellers’ lawn. It is, we find out early on in the play, all that remains of a tree planted in Larry’s memory. It blew down in a storm the previous night—the very night that Ann came to visit. Kate sees that as a cosmic sign that Larry is still out there somewhere, alive and trying to come home. The stump spurs her determination to keep any of her friends and family members from forgetting about Larry or treating him as dead. She slips into a sort of mania, constantly directing thinly-veiled insults and tests at Annie, to Chris’s annoyance.</p><p>The idea of an ordinary man accidentally killing his own son by shipping out defective plane parts is surreal. Yet the way it destroys the lives of a bunch of ordinary people feels all too real and haunting, even today.</p><p>Chris, the dreamer craving true love and inspiration, learns to be practical. The sweet, innocent housewife, starts losing her mind. The man who killed 21 innocent young men wove a web of lies among the people closest to him and put his business partner in prison, all to live an ideal, stable life alongside his family. The man who deludes himself into thinking that he was innocent—that his remarkably selfish actions were justified—walks only feet away from his wife, son, and twice soon-to-be daughter-in-law and puts a bullet in his own head.</p><p>“All My Sons” is a challenging play to take on. It deals with grave themes and tackles profound ideas surrounding the innate evil in humanity through subtle interactions between characters. Only actors who have committed themselves to their parts, and to the story itself, can do the play justice, and STC successfully tackled the challenges of this material, building an engaging, moving performance.</p>	Article	400	2018-01-23 02:47:33.587007	2018-01-23 02:47:33.587007
1003	﻿The Galaxy Far, Far Away Continues to Excite “The Last Jedi” has been met with such resounding success thanks to its wider-reaching emotional depth and modern viewpoints. <p>Chewbacca dies! Just kidding. Taking place immediately after “The Force Awakens” (2015), “The Last Jedi” is the latest film in the new Star Wars trilogy. Its huge success comes with being the most feminist Star Wars movie to date, while addressing key social themes like maturity and gender roles. “The Last Jedi” does miss a few chances for better character development, but it remains enjoyable for old and new fans alike.</p><p>Being a long-time fan of the franchise himself, director Rian Johnson’s approach to the movie draws much from the previous Star Wars films, with the large-scale space dogfights and lightsaber duels that have made Star Wars so iconic and instantly recognizable. The film opens up featuring the last of a torn Resistance, led by a war-wary General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who reprises her role in the grand finale through a heavy-hitting performance.</p><p>Between documenting the Resistance’s attempts to escape impending First Order wrath, Johnson takes plenty of time to further explore the relationship between Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Viewers get to watch as Rey tries to convince Luke to train her while we learn about the final downfall of the Jedi. Rey’s determination in trying to persuade Luke and her lack of hesitation when she has the chance to help Kylo become good again add to Rey’s personality. She also sets the distinction between Kylo Ren and Ben Solo, with Kylo being a demonous conduit for the Dark Side that kills mercilessly and Ben being the son of Han and Leia, who lost his way because no one seemed to care about him and his achievements as a young adult. Luke is also forced to finally address his role in Ben Solo’s younger life. Through this, we learn that even a Jedi Master like Luke is not unsusceptible to emotions that control how we act, often wrongly.</p><p>This display of emotion is present in many other key characters on screen. Men being emotionally vulnerable is no stranger to the Star Wars universe; It was first seen in Anakin Skywalker and is now seen in almost all the male main characters in the new trilogy. However, Star Wars is also now turning its attention to strengthening female characters. General Organa has more of a speaking role and remains feisty and composed despite personal loss. Rey chooses to see the good in others and rarely gives up unless she has to. The First Order’s Captain Phasma is a symbol of power and discipline in her shining anti-blaster armor. It’s so important that such a far-reaching franchise continues addressing gender roles, when most films overlook female and male empowerment.</p><p>Tied into this is Johnson’s biggest message in “The Last Jedi,” stated blatantly by Ben when he makes a plea for Rey to join him: “Just let go.” It’s seen plaintively throughout the film, when Luke tries letting go of his Jedi origins because of shame of having failed to keep Ben from the Dark Side. Rey has to let go of her obsession with who her parents are so that it doesn’t affect her behavior and bring her more pain. Finn’s exchange with his former First Order mentor is his final goodbye to the Empire’s teachings. In contrast, various other characters experience a plethora of negative emotions because they can’t let go of shame or regretful actions.</p><p>But being the longest Star Wars film to date, it could have easily shed a half hour or used it to explain other issues. Johnson spends too long delving into older Star Wars lore, which Luke seems to brood over constantly and discusses sparingly with Rey. And while Kylo Ren becomes a very complex villain, Captain Phasma, an already powerful non-Force user, has as much of a role as she did in the previous film, which isn’t much. I would also have loved to see more of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), the newest addition to the cast. Rose already displayed her pragmatism, observational ability, and quick wit, but her unlikely rise to heroism would have been all the more engaging with more character development.</p><p>However, not all of the two and a half hours is confusing or negative. Besides recreating the incredibly iconic Star Wars opening theme, film composer John Williams’ music is heard throughout. Unlike earlier episodes, his compositions are heard more frequently and closely reflect what is happening in the movie, like when the brass and percussion start weaving between the higher and lower octaves whenever the power of the Dark Side is on full display. Williams’s film score also does well to arouse the audience’s adrenaline whenever another exciting battle ensues, while being equally able to leave viewers troubled when characters experience loss or pain.</p><p>Viewers are also given the chance to examine characters more intimately with close-ups and medium shots that catch slight changes in facial expression. In scenes like Rey and Ben’s confrontation with the Supreme Leader, the camera captures Rey’s intense fear and sudden doubt in Ben’s goodness. Though his face barely changes, we can see the inner struggle between Ben and Kylo before he reaches a decision.</p><p>We also can’t help but enjoy the qualities of a modern “space Western” as Star Wars has been so affectionately deemed. Having blurred the lines between distinctly good and evil, a final Star Wars feel is returned in a classic Light Side versus Dark Side standoff. The First Order’s vast array of firepower is on full display, while the ever-vigilant Resistance retains its never-ending hope in the face of doom. And then Luke Skywalker comes.</p><p>“The Last Jedi” has been met with great success and it’s not a wonder why. Director Rian Johnson has been able to create a film wholly original while keeping the classicality of Star Wars. Even with the introduction of so many new characters and ideas, the film isn’t rushed and continues to tell a beautifully woven story that takes place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</p>	Article	401	2018-01-23 02:48:10.38225	2018-01-23 02:48:10.38225
1004	﻿There is More Than What Meets the Eye in “The Greatest Showman” A review of “The Greatest Showman” <p>Fans said goodbye to the Barnum and Bailey Circus, otherwise known as “The Greatest Show On Earth,” in May of 2017. The production met its end after a drawn-out battle with animal rights activists and a drop in popularity after the removal of elephants from the performances. While its end was highly publicized, most were unaware of the circus’ initial path to success. Conveniently, this story has integrated itself into popular culture through the film, “The Greatest Showman,” which was released in December of 2017 and directed by Michael Gracey.</p><p>The movie-musical opens to a vibrant scene in a circus tent filled with a diverse group of entertainers performing stunts that include—but are definitely not limited to—stilt walking, horseback riding, and trapeze artistry. The crowd surrounding them shouts with excitement as the camera zeroes in on a man dressed in a bright red jacket and top hat standing in the center of the frenzy. The man is clearly supposed to be P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), who most of us know as the founder of the famed Barnum and Bailey Circus. The two hours that follow tell the story of the circus and Barnum’s rise to popularity and are, of course, jam-packed with uplifting and enthusiastic musical numbers.</p><p>It’s undeniable that “The Greatest Showman” is a visually stunning film. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey’s use of sweeping camera angles and intense close-ups pairs well with the elaborate, richly-colored costumes. A notable outfit was a luminescent white ball gown worn by European singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). The pure white of the dress fits well with the context of the film, as it is worn when Barnum realizes the recognition Lind could bring him and consequently pays less attention to his more eccentrically talented performers.</p><p>However, what takes away from the film’s appeal are the overlooked and problematic aspects of Barnum himself. The movie portrays the circus as a celebration of differences. Barnum takes on the role of a benevolent revolutionary who breaks social norms by offering a place for the outcasts. In reality, Barnum's path to success was most likely less selfless and bordered on exploitative. The film’s glorification of Barnum is demonstrated in its depiction of Charles Stratton (Sam Humphrey), a little person enlisted by Barnum to perform in the circus under the stage name General Tom Thumb. The movie portrays Stratton as a young adult who is insecure about his stature until Barnum teaches him to celebrate his uniqueness. In reality, Stratton was four years old at the time of his employment, but it was stated to the public that he was 11. For performances, Barnum had Stratton smoke cigars and drink wine, which drastically differs from the heroic general character Barnum embodies in the film.</p><p>While I had my doubts about the way Barnum was depicted on screen, I was pleased to see the portrayal of an interracial relationship between Barnum’s right-hand-man Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) and trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). Though they are primarily known for their Disney-related successes, Zendaya and Efron do not disappoint in this feature film. Both actors step up to the plate and deliver emotionally impressive performances and highlight their striking voices in various songs. The pair sing an inspiring duet titled, “Rewrite the Stars,” and over the course of the movie, communicate the message that love goes beyond racial boundaries.</p><p>I was excited to finally see a movie featuring an interracial couple, though I noticed that “The Greatest Showman” could have made more of an effort in terms of race and representation. Barnum has a diverse cast of circus performers, but he and his business partner Carlyle are both portrayed by white actors which, in a way, pushes the performers into the background and makes Wheeler and Carlyle’s relationship seem more like a plot device. Wheeler’s brother, W.D. (Yahya Abdul-Mateen), appears infrequently in the film and has very few lines of dialogue. His lack of prominence does make me wonder if Wheeler’s romance with Carlyle is only incorporated to make the movie seem more aware. While its casting is progressive, it is slightly disheartening to see that every person of color in the film is a part of Barnum’s cast of “oddities.”</p><p>Though its racial inconsistencies are hard to overlook, “The Greatest Showman” does fulfill its ultimate purpose, which is to be a crowd pleaser. The backbone of the film is its score, filled with heartfelt lyrics and catchy melodies. Though the film is set in the 1800s, the soundtrack has a mostly pop feel, which gives the movie a refreshingly modern twist. Its composers, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, have already gained recognition from their work on “Dear Evan Hansen,” the Tony-winning musical, and “La La Land,” the 2016 box-office hit. The well-written music is also complementary to the cast’s powerful voices, notably that of Keala Seattle, who plays bearded lady Lettie Lutz. Seattle, an actress primarily known for her roles on stage, has a powerful presence on film that makes itself known during “This Is Me,” a dynamic ballad about self-acceptance. Another impressive performance was given by Michelle Williams, who draws viewers in as Charity Hallett, Barnum’s free-spirited yet strong-willed wife. Williams’s acting is believable and mature and leaves viewers rooting for her character as she questions Barnum’s devotion to her.</p><p>Over the course of the film, Hugh Jackman proves himself a perfect fit for the lead role of P.T. Barnum, delivering a performance that leaves audiences both rooting for his character, while also questioning his judgement. With his impressive background in musical theater, notably the role of Jean Valjean in the film adaptation of “Les Misérables,” it is clear that Jackman is in his element in every scene in the film.</p><p>If there is one thing that audiences are sure to take away from “The Greatest Showman,” it would indisputably be the film’s message of embracing differences and celebrating them. The movie is well-meaning and family-friendly, but upon closer examination, there are several obvious discrepancies. Especially in light of Barnum and Bailey’s recent downfall, a nod to the circus’ controversial past could help acknowledge the flaws that were part of the production, as well as touch on their continued presence throughout history. The film is sure to entertain, but with its questionable representation and glossed over evidence, it is certainly more likeable when viewed through a rose-tinted lens.</p>	Article	402	2018-01-23 02:49:25.491683	2018-01-23 02:49:25.491683
671	Mimbas Striking for More The Stuyvesant girls’ soccer team is gearing up for what is hopefully another successful season. <p>The Stuyvesant girls’ soccer team, the Mimbas, is looking to build off of a successful previous season and make another playoff appearance. Coming off a 6-5 record, a fourth place finish, and a first round playoff elimination, members of the team are still upbeat, believing that a solid core infused with new talent will carry them farther into the postseason than previous years.</p><p>This year will present several new obstacles for the team, such as adjusting to the higher level of competition in their new Manhattan A2 division and replacing the production of their three graduated seniors. Nevertheless, the girls are excited to make a name for themselves in an unfamiliar division. Senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl believes that this new division will bring more adversity, but remains steadfast that the team will adapt and that their skill set will shine.</p><p>Ruhl’s co-captain, senior Saloni Majmudar, agrees. “It’s definitely the most well-rounded and experienced team we’ve had in the past four years,” she said. The team has players in every grade for the first time in recent memory and the talent has allowed for a more competitive environment in practices.</p><p>The loss of the seniors, including second-highest goal scorer on the team Brigit Bacon-Blaber (‘17), will no doubt sting, but both captains believe that their players are ready and are more than capable of stepping up. “Although we lost three seniors, I think the team is even stronger this year,” Ruhl said. Sophomore Selene Kaehny, Stuyvesant’s leading goal-scorer from last year, will hopefully contribute to making the next step.</p><p>Likewise, Majmudar commented that the team will miss the constant positive energy of the seniors. However, the new talent has reassured her that they will have a successful season. They have taken steps to prepare for the new competition during practice and have confidence that the adjustments will bear fruit out on the field.</p><p>“We’ve been working a lot on building cohesion through game-like situations and scrimmages,” Majmudar said.</p><p>The team is planning to scrimmage LaGuardia High School before its first league game, and this will provide a level of competition and experience that cannot be found in practice. “We do a lot of scrimmaging to not only become better players, but to build a better team dynamic,” Ruhl said.</p><p>Team cohesion and the ability to work as a unit will play an important part in how competitive the Mimbas are going to be in a tougher division. Though it will no doubt be an uphill climb, the team is eager to get back on the field and make another run for the playoffs. Led by Majmudar and Ruhl, the Mimbas will hopefully kick off another successful season followed by a deep postseason run on September 7 against Baruch College Campus High School.</p>	Article	28	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
672	﻿2017-2018 NBA Preseason Power Rankings With the NBA offseason coming to a close, we rank all the teams in the NBA. <p>The 2017 NBA offseason was one of the most eventful in recent memory. The Western Conference became much stronger, while the Eastern Conference suffered. Superstar Chris Paul was traded from the Los Angeles Clippers to the Houston Rockets. Free agent Gordon Hayward decided to sign with the Boston Celtics. The Chicago Bulls traded star Jimmy Butler to the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Oklahoma City Thunder acquired star Paul George. The Cleveland Cavaliers and Celtics swapped starting point guards. The new outlook of many teams after the offseason has dramatically changed the hierarchy of the league.</p><p>WESTERN CONFERENCE</p><p>1. Golden State Warriors</p><p>This offseason, the Warriors proved that the rich just keep getting richer. After beating the Cavaliers in the Finals 4-1, the defending champions enter the 2017-2018 season as heavy favorites to win the Finals again. They maintained their current roster by resigning superstars Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, and capable role players Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. They also added Nick Young and Omri Casspi to bolster their bench behind their loaded starting lineup of Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Durant, and center Zaza Pachulia</p><p>2. Houston Rockets</p><p>The Rockets now have the best backcourt in the league, made up of Chris Paul and 2017 MVP runner-up James Harden. While the rest of their starting lineup may not be full of standout players, the Rockets’ depth at all positions will allow them to challenge the Warriors in the Western Conference.</p><p>3. Oklahoma City Thunder</p><p>MVP winner Russell Westbrook finally found some help after the Thunder traded for all-star Paul George. While the two will be able to bring the Thunder far into the playoffs, they may not be able to handle teams like the Rockets and Warriors because the other players in the lineup are not good enough to help them go farther.</p><p>4. San Antonio Spurs</p><p>Unlike many teams in the Western Conference, the Spurs had a relatively quiet offseason. Their only addition was Rudy Gay, who is coming back from major achilles surgery. This lineup was enough to make the 2016-2017 Western Conference Finals, but the West is now much stronger and this aging roster will have a tough time competing.</p><p>5. Minnesota Timberwolves</p><p>While the Timberwolves were one of the worst teams in the league last year, they are now one of the best. The acquisitions of all-star Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague will help superstar Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins lead the ‘Wolves to the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only is their starting lineup filled with stars, but their bench is solid enough to help the team go deep into the playoffs.</p><p>6. Los Angeles Clippers</p><p>The Clippers traded superstar Chris Paul to the Rockets but acquired Danilo Gallinari from the Denver Nuggets. While losing Paul hurts, Gallinari and the strong frontcourt of Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan will lead an otherwise average roster to the playoffs.</p><p>7. Denver Nuggets</p><p>The Nuggets traded Danilo Gallinari to the Clippers this summer, but acquired Paul Millsap through the same trade. The Nuggets also have a strong bench which ranked eighth in points scored last year and will play a large role in their playoff push in a strong Western Conference. Millsap, along with frontcourt partner Nikola Jokic, will lead the Nuggets to the playoffs for the first time in five years.</p><p>8. Portland Trail Blazers</p><p>The Blazers must lean heavily on a backcourt of all-star snub Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, who averaged 50.0 points per game (PPG) together. The Blazers also have a good young center in Jusuf Nurkic, who will help carry a roster of average and below-average players.</p><p>9. New Orleans Pelicans</p><p>After signing Rajon Rondo, the Pelicans finally have a respectable backcourt of Rondo and Jrue Holiday. The Pelicans will pair that backcourt with the best frontcourt in the league of Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins, who averaged a combined 55.0 PPG last season. While this team looks good enough to make the playoffs on paper, a lack of chemistry between Davis and Cousins may negatively affect their play on the court.</p><p>10. Memphis Grizzlies</p><p>After losing Zach Randolph and Vince Carter, the Grizzlies have a big hole at the power forward position and scoring off the bench. While they do have great leaders in all-star Marc Gasol and Mike Conley, the Grizzlies will have a hard time making the playoffs in a loaded Western Conference.</p><p>EASTERN CONFERENCE</p><p>1. Cleveland Cavaliers</p><p>After losing to the Warriors in the Finals, the Cavaliers tried to form a roster this offseason that would be able to defeat the Warriors in future matchups. Complicating matters, Kyrie Irving demanded a trade from the team, resulting in the biggest blockbuster of the summer: Irving was traded to the Boston Celtics for Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Zizic and a 2018 first round draft pick. However, Thomas and superstar LeBron James will still lead the Cavaliers to a fourth straight NBA Finals appearance.</p><p>2. Boston Celtics</p><p>The Celtics had one of the busiest offseasons this summer and only four players remain from last year’s roster. The team acquired Kyrie Irving (from the Cleveland Cavaliers) and Gordon Hayward (via free agency), while trading Isaiah Thomas (to the Cavaliers), Avery Bradley (to the Detroit Pistons) and Jae Crowder (to the Cavaliers). The Celtics are better than they were last year, as they now sport a starting lineup of Irving, Jaylen Brown, Hayward, Marcus Morris and Al Horford. After losing to the Cavaliers last year in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics will try to take the next step and advance to the NBA Finals.</p><p>3. Toronto Raptors</p><p>Led by an all-star backcourt of Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors hope to make the Eastern Conference Finals. With the acquisition of CJ Miles, the Raptors improved their starting lineup, which now consists of Lowry, DeRozan, Miles, Serge Ibaka and Jonas Valanciunas. While the Raptors have a shot of making the Conference Finals, their lackluster bench may hold them back.</p><p>4. Washington Wizards</p><p>With a young core of John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr., the Wizards are hoping to finally get past the second round of the playoffs. This is definitely a possibility this season, as all three will look to take the next step forward. However, an injury-prone Beal and a weak frontcourt may lead to their downfall.</p><p>5. Milwaukee Bucks</p><p>With blossoming superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo leading this young team, the Bucks are improving every season. Their starting lineup, made up of 2017 Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon, Khris Middleton, Jabari Parker, Antetokounmpo and Greg Monroe, is formidable. This starting lineup and deep bench have potential to be perennial powerhouse in the East.</p><p>6. Miami Heat</p><p>This season, potential all-star Hassan Whiteside, Goran Dragic, and Dion Waiters look to lead the Heat to the playoffs. Dragic and Waiters are skilled offensive players and Whiteside is one of the best rim protectors in the league. Along with this strong core, the Heat added Kelly Olynyk to the bench that already ranked fifth in scoring last year. This bench will help relieve the core of some of the scoring burden and will push the Heat back to the playoffs.</p><p>7. Charlotte Hornets</p><p>After acquiring Dwight Howard and drafting Malik Monk, the Hornets are in a good position to make the playoffs this year. In desperate need of a solid rebounder, Howard and his 12.7 rebounds per game will help the team. Monk will also bring good scoring off the bench, a necessity as they ranked 19th in scoring.</p><p>8. Detroit Pistons</p><p>The Pistons traded Marcus Morris to the Celtics for Avery Bradley this offseason. This move counteracts the hole of not re-signing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, and Jon Leuer is capable of replacing Morris. Bradley also brings much needed defense compliment to the defensive-liability Reggie Jackson. Matching those two with Andre Drummond will make this team good enough to sneak into the playoffs.</p><p>9. Philadelphia 76ers</p><p>The 76ers have one of the best young cores in the league, made up of Markelle Fultz, Ben Simmons, Dario Saric and Joel Embiid. They have a great shot at making the playoffs, but the team is young and injury-prone, making it hard to expect much this coming year.</p><p>10. New York Knicks</p><p>Now that the Phil Jackson era is finally over, budding superstar Kristaps Porzingis will look to lead the Knicks to the playoffs amidst trade rumors surrounding Carmelo Anthony. However, the Knicks will not be able to make the playoffs because there is not enough talent on the team to support Porzingis and Anthony.</p>	Article	29	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
673	﻿New Research Partnership to Help Young Stuyvesant Scientists Flourish Stuyvesant has recently established a relationship with the Young Scientist Foundation, which held a presentation where two Stuyvesant students were invited to showcase their scientific discoveries. <p>Stuyvesant hosted a summer research poster presentation organized by The Young Scientist Foundation (YSF), a research mentorship program, on Monday, August 28. Seniors Marta Pawluczuk and Rochelle Vayntrub were invited to showcase their work alongside 12 other NYC students. The presentation was part of a new partnership between the school and the program to develop research opportunities at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Efforts to expand Stuyvesant’s research program began during the summer of 2016 when Principal Eric Contreras met with YSF President and co-founder Dr. Goutham Narla. YSF members were invited to the school to tour the building and to observe students in action during their science classes. “[YSF] already had relationships with some other schools in the area. I was actually surprised that we hadn’t done this before,” Contreras said. “I’ve been thinking about strategic ways of building our research and science programs. Our collaboration with the Young Scientist Foundation is just one of many pieces to developing these programs.”</p><p>As part of its program, YSF matched students to laboratories and mentors around the city. Pawluczuk worked with a medical student and a head-and-neck surgeon in the Division of Endocrine Surgery at New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center. Her research looked at the significance and occurrence of perineural invasion, the spread of cancer around nerves.</p><p>Vayntrub worked at the Platelet Research Laboratory at the New York Blood Center under the mentorship of Dr. Bruce Sachais. There, she was involved in the development of a novel drug to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, a disorder which creates or enlarges blood clots.</p><p>Pawluczuk and Vayntrub both struggled to find research opportunities before this program. “I had always wanted to participate in research, but as a high school student, it was extremely difficult for me to find and acquire any position in a laboratory despite my persistence. Very few scientists were willing to open their labs to young people,” Vayntrub said in an e-mail interview. “Thanks to [YSF], the door to the Platelet Research Laboratory is always open, and I will always have somewhere to come back to.”</p><p>Both students believe the partnership gave them more access to research than they expected to have and valuable experience for the future. “I was blown away by the fact that [...] as a high school student, I was doing the same level of research as a third year medical resident,” Pawluczuk said in an e-mail interview. “By allowing me to experience all sides of research, I feel better suited for future steps I want to take to help me reach my career goals.”</p><p>The positive response from Stuyvesant’s participants in the program has motivated Contreras to develop plans to enhance the school’s science program. “In other initiatives, I’m working on an engineering program at Stuyvesant,” Contreras said. “We’ll make sure to provide the foundational classes that allow students to pursue more advanced classes, prepare them to be knowledgeable in those areas, and inspire them to make connections and collaborations beyond those areas.”</p>	Article	32	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
674	﻿Otherwise Lost: Stories from Suresnes When I learned that I was going to Paris with my family during the summer, the first thing that came into my mind was one... <p>When I learned that I was going to Paris with my family during the summer, the first thing that came into my mind was one name: Calvin William Greene, World War I soldier and Stuyvesant graduate.</p><p>Greene’s story had been brought to life by senior Dawei Huang as part of history teacher David Hanna and his AP U.S. History students’ contributions to the Monuments Project. The Monuments Project was started by the American School of Paris. It centers around honoring and telling the stories of the soldiers interred at Suresnes American Cemetery, just outside of Paris.</p><p>Since senior Justin Chan had found Greene’s name etched into the bronze plaque on the first floor, Mr. Hanna had talked a lot about how wonderful it would be to have someone go to France and visit Greene’s resting place in person. They could bring a little piece from the Stuyvesant of the today to the gravesite of a soldier who graduated one hundred years ago: a small pennant donated by the Stuyvesant Alumni Association.</p><p>I was honored to be able to be that person. In France, I met the American School of Paris Middle School Director, Jeffrey Lippman, and the Technology Integrator and leader of the Monuments Project, Claude Lord, at the cemetery on August 17.</p><p>After introducing ourselves and walking around the cemetery a bit, we found Greene’s grave. I remember thinking about what it would have been like to talk to him. On the surface, he seemed stoic and even a little bit intimidating. In one of the two pictures of him, Greene was dressed in full army get-up. In the other, he wore a three-piece suit. He was a star athlete in tennis, and he was the manager of the rowing team. Like your typical Stuyvesant student, he had the grades, too. Albeit, not the academic grades, but the physical: Greene passed the army’s training and conditioning tests with a resounding 99 percent score. A Second Lieutenant at the age of twenty, Greene was one of the youngest officers in the United States Aviation Corps.</p><p>What would he think of a Stuyvesant student body that is now co-ed and three-quarters Asian? Or of the new building, 10 stories high, not even being in Stuytown? I can’t imagine any of my fellow classmates becoming officers in the army two or three years from now, but then again, could he have imagined the academic reputation that Stuyvesant has now? We live in completely different worlds, 100 years apart. Even though, looking at a map of Manhattan, if he were alive today, we’d only live two miles apart.</p><p>After a moment spent taking in the scene and posing for a couple of pictures, the American official on site, Matthew Brown, came up to us and offered a tour of the grounds. He explained the history of the cemetery as we walked around.</p><p>Although there hadn’t actually been any fighting in Paris during World War I, the site of the cemetery had been chosen so nearby for good reason. Each one of the 1,541 American soldiers buried at Suresnes who had served in World War I had gotten wounded on the front lines, had been taken to the American Hospital, and hadn’t made it. The cemetery sits on the slope of a hill. At the top, there is a commemorative chapel, from which we could see into Paris from above. The chapel has two wings, one in memory of the American soldiers from World War I, the other in memory of those from World War II (there are 24 graves dedicated to unknown dead from WWII as well). The walls of the chapel are lined with four bronze plaques. They bear the names of 974 additional missing American soldiers from WWI, most of whom, Brown told us, were presumably killed by German U-Boat attacks before they could make it across the Atlantic.</p><p>From that vantage point on top of the hill, we could also see through a web of trees down to the American Hospital. Brown explained to us that, at the start of the war, the hospital had only 30 or 40 beds, but by the war’s end, it could hold almost 650.</p><p>One fact that I remember very clearly from our tour was when we saw, etched in marble, a list of the other dozen or so American WWI cemeteries in France. Next to the name of each of the cemeteries was the number of soldiers that had been buried there. The American Cemetery at Suresnes was one of the smallest.</p><p>I remember thinking that the sheer amount of death in WWI was incomprehensible.</p><p>The work that the Monuments Project is doing is so important because it helps to shine a light on Americans of the past who, otherwise, would be lost in the numbers and the statistics, For me, my fellow students, and the entire Stuyvesant community to be a part of that experience—by connecting through Greene—was really something special.</p>	Article	33	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
675	﻿Assuming Altruism The U.S. should adopt a presumed consent organ donation system. <p>Rafael Matesanz reviews the numbers released by Spain’s Ministry of Health from his office. As the director of the institution in charge of Spain’s organ transplant system, he quickly crunches the numbers—4,360 transplants carried out in 2014 means the organ donation rate has risen from 14 donors per million citizens in the late 20th century to 36 per million. This places Spain at the top of the list in terms of global organ donations, surpassing the United States and France at 26 per million and Germany at 11 per million.</p><p>Matesanz does not attribute Spain’s incredible numbers to exceptional citizen altruism. In an interview with Newsweek, when asked if Spanish citizens have a “unique store of generosity,” he shook his head, replying, “We have asked the same question in various surveys over the years and every time 56 percent or 57 percent say they would donate their organs after dying … [that’s] roughly the EU average.” He cites a newly streamlined organ donation process as the key. That, in conjunction with Spain’s donation laws, seems to be the key in attaining such high numbers. Yet the feasibility of the U.S. following such a model remains up in the air.</p><p>Currently, the deceased donation system in the U.S. works as follows: you must first sign up to put your name on the donor list with your state’s Organ Donor Registry via the Department of Motor Vehicles. You have the opportunity to choose which tissues or organs you wish to donate as well as the freedom to change your donation status at any time. In the unfortunate instance that you are ever left brain dead, doctors will work in conjunction with a representative from the closest Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) branch (which is a private non-profit organization). Following approval, the OPO will contact the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), which matches donors to their recipients.</p><p>In 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services conducted a national survey on organ donation behaviors and beliefs. Similar to the proportions in 1993 and 2005, adults in the U.S. consistently maintain a positive view of organ donation, with 94.9 percent supporting or strongly supporting organ donation. That 94.9 percent, however, reveals a stark contrast between ideological beliefs and actual action when you consider that only 60.1 percent of adults have signed up to be a donor.</p><p>Even of those that refused to sign up, only a quarter cited either religion or health as reasons for not donating. The rest reported reasons such as “undecided/don’t know” and “not interested,” demonstrating indifference as opposed to legitimate barriers.</p><p>Combating this passivity is the first step the U.S. must take in order to provide transplants for the more than 116,000 people waiting for a donation. But history makes it clear that passivity—in the face of the most recent presidential election—is going nowhere. It then follows that one viable option is to implement the presumed consent system.</p><p>Presumed consent, a system that France implemented earlier this year, is also known as an “opt-out” system, meaning that it is assumed all citizens wish to donate unless they explicitly state they do not wish to. And in the first few days, only 150,000 people out of the population of 66 million opted out.</p><p>Not only does presumed consent battle passivity, it also changes the context in which we view organ donation. A 2012 study done by researchers at Cornell University and Stanford University revealed that in an “opt-in” system, like that of the U.S., citizens see organ donation as an “exceptional act of altruism.” Yet in an “opt-out” system, the refusal to donate becomes the exceptional act. In other words, the “opt-in” system is like leaving your entire estate to charity. The “opt-out” system is like skipping your daughter’s wedding to sleep in. The former requires some hint of virtue, while the latter is simply a given.</p><p>The second thing we must do is aim to focus our efforts on education and efficiency. The benefits and risks of organ donations must be taught to students before they make the personal decision to remove their names from the list of potential donors. In addition, the idea that Americans and their families will lose freedom over their bodies after death must be set straight. In reality, doctors in the U.S. will respect the family’s ultimate decision as they determine what will happen with their kin’s body. This is due to a few factors, including a combination of fear of legal conflict and bad publicity, as well as an understanding that keeping the body intact may bring the family closure.</p><p>Looking to Spain as the model of efficiency, the country has implemented an initiative to train 16,000 professionals to be both transplant coordinators and internal care specialists, instead of having to tread through the complex networks of hospitals and outside organizations. Germany especially has an extremely low donation record because of an “uncontrollably complex web of private clinics and insurance firms.” The U.S. must ensure that the OPO and OPTN work not as private companies with a government affiliation, but transparent government branches with more uniform standards and training methods for staff. Though this will require an investment of time and resources, it will prevent viable donations from slipping through the cracks that our inefficient system currently has.</p><p>Ultimately, complete consent and altruism must remain the crux of organ donation. A redesigned standard donation procedure and presumed consent will not change that.</p>	Article	34	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
676	﻿Being Attracted to Kids Is Not a Choice, but It Can Be Helped  <p>One could hope that people in the future will be able to publicly say, “I suffer from pedophilia,” just like they can say, “I suffer from severe depression.”</p><p>Few sexual taboos are as universally reviled as pedophilia, and it is one of the most heavily punished sexual crimes in the criminal justice system, with sentences upward of five years. Copulation and molestation often lead to grave problems in victims, such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. This is not to mention all of the children whose lives are uprooted for the sake of making child pornography.</p><p>With the heinous consequences of their sexual preferences in mind, it is very easy to harshly indict pedophiles as deserving of castration or even, as Trump has suggested, the death penalty. While pedophilia has devastating effects on its victims, the majority of the populace ignores an inconvenient truth—that pedophilia is compulsory, and thus deserves to be categorized as a mental disorder.</p><p>Pedophiles are too often seen as depraved fiends who target children using verbal and emotional manipulation, and find pleasure in doing so. But the reality is that the vast majority of pedophiles are terrified by their own urges and the thought of turning them into reality appalls them. In fact, the World Health Organization’s definition of “disorders of sexual preference” includes the phrase “acts on the urges or is markedly distressed by them.” Though the exact causes of pedophilic tendencies are unknown, they are heavily linked to experiences such as being molested as a child or conditions such as brain damage.</p><p>Consider for a moment how homosexuals (who also technically have an involuntary alternate sexual preference) have been treated throughout most of the course of human history. Sodomy was, and still is in some places, a crime punishable by stoning, flogging, or death. One could find many parallels between the now-outdated views toward gays and the still-relevant ones toward pedophiles, from the calls for castration to those for execution. If only they looked to Paul’s words in Timothy 1:8-10, which state, “We also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful…the sexually immoral,” the harsh view of those considered “sexually immoral” in those times reflects the way many people today see pedophiles.</p><p>Of course, there is a crucial difference between these two types of sexual differences, which is that pedophilia, unfortunately, has a victim. There just isn’t a way for it to be tolerated when it can be so damaging to the child. There is no way to fully resolve the problem, so pedophiles must instead look to treatment for salvation.</p><p>Currently, no person who has pedophilic tendencies would even consider sharing his or her problems or trying to get help for the condition—the societal backlash and ostracization could ruin the person’s social prospects and career. Instead, one of two things happens: either their attraction is suppressed with no one to talk to about it (a prospect that seems torturous for a person of any sexual orientation), or, even worse, their pedophilia is acted upon in secrecy.</p><p>It’s unimaginable that we would, as a society, allow schizophrenics to have their mental state remain untreated and potentially have it degraded to the point where they would turn to violence. Schizophrenia, in its acute forms, can cause people to have psychotic breakouts that in some cases lead to aggression. That raises a question: why is it that society accepts the diagnosing and treating of schizophrenia, but not of pedophilia?</p><p>Going forward, there are two options: the first is to offer the pedophile no helpful resources to deal with his or her sexual urges and then proceed to castigate and ostracize them if they offend, effectively ruining their lives. The second is to offer confidential, easily accessible treatment to anyone who feels he or she could offend and prevent this. For instance, the Charité hospital in Germany offers anonymous therapy sessions, and patients’ privacy is protected by Germany’s strict confidentiality laws unless there are criminal charges currently pending against them.</p><p>Ultimately, instead of launching witch hunts against groups of people, which society is prone to do, we should attempt to see what makes them likely to offend, recognize that it’s not their choice to be attracted to children, and try to find a method of prevention. Recent decades have seen a push to reduce the stigma attached to mental disorders such as depression in Western culture. It would be a more onerous task for the same shift to occur with pedophilia, but one could hope that people in the future will be able to publicly say, “I suffer from pedophilia,” just like they can say, “I suffer from severe depression.”</p>	Article	36	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
677	﻿When Politics Has a Price Tag An analysis of how celebrities increasingly use political awareness as a means to boost their image. <p>The rise of the word “woke” is perhaps one of the best indications of an increasing politically aware pop culture consciousness. Firmly rooted in a younger generation, “woke” is an adjective signifying an above-average and liberal understanding of current affairs, particularly relating to social injustices such as racism. Though originating from the dialect of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), “woke” made its way into the more general public lexicon following the widely publicized 2014 Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests (a response to alleged instances of police brutality involving black men such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner). The birth of activist movements such as BLM taken in conjunction with the recent backlash toward President Trump’s treatment of minorities and women have pushed millennials and members of Generation X into an increasingly politically aware mindset.</p><p>While there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the notion of an enhanced political awareness, being “woke” becomes an issue when the act is commodified. Artists and celebrities have capitalized on the increasing awareness surrounding legitimate social unrest simply as a means of enhancing their popularity. In other words, being “woke” has often been reduced to a trend. Celebrities lean on a platform of political awareness, without largely caring about the issues beyond what can be visible online to a mass audience.</p><p>Pop singer Katy Perry’s recent single “Chained To The Rhythm” embodies this shallow awareness. Its vague and hardly politically suggestive lyrics lead it to fall heavily short of the anthem meant to “start conversations” that Perry believes to be (as she expressed in a pre-Grammys interview) some sort of musical remedy to the tumultuous political climate. Such a frail attempt at awareness is further undermined when looking back at the singer’s oftentimes problematic behavior; she has repeatedly appropriated other cultures by donning a kimono or cornrows, and encouraged stereotypes through her song “Ur So Gay.”</p><p>Lena Dunham is another celebrity who holds herself as a political role model for feminism. However, she has instead succeeded in becoming the poster child of “white feminism,” a term that has also gained traction in recent years, likely as a response to the increasingly ingenuine environment of political awareness. This refers to feminism that fails to recognize the greater oppression experienced by underprivileged, especially non-white, women. While Dunham has used her status as a feminist as a foundation for many aspects of her career, (including starting “Lenny Letter,” a feminist newsletter), her shaky stance has also been revealed at times. In a few instances, she allegedly made racist remarks about black American football player Odell Beckham Jr. and actor Michael B. Jordan, revealing that her apparent passion for equality does not extend to people of color.</p><p>Alternately, preeminent fashion model Kendall Jenner’s recent advertisement for Pepsi represents a rare moment when this sort of shallow awareness was widely recognized and disparaged. Jenner’s participation in such an ad (which, in attempting to sell the beverage, utilized scenes from protests akin to Black Lives Matter) represents one of the purest examples of political awareness becoming merely a commodity.</p><p>Though the immense criticism received by both Jenner and the brand Pepsi led to the ad being pulled, similar, more subtle instances from other artists, such as Katy Perry, often go unnoticed. The perpetrators continue to profit without giving in to, in short, exploitation.</p><p>That’s not to say that it is impossible to be a genuinely “woke” artist or celebrity. One need only look at the work of Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar to see that one does not have to sacrifice strong political authority for success. Both artists deliver messages in their music that are unashamedly clear, presented not to gain anything but to spread a message regardless of any possible controversy. This is clear when Lamar spits out the words, “We hate po-po / Want to kill us dead in the street fo sho” on his acclaimed album “To Pimp a Butterfly” or when Beyoncé  wore a Black Panther-inspired outfit during the Halftime show of Super Bowl 50, thus aligning herself with the controversial Black nationalist party. White artists would do well to learn from artists such as these, reminding themselves that being “woke” is not a carefully curated persona, but ultimately a tool by which to effect change.</p>	Article	39	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
678	﻿Hollywood’s Misrepresentation of Asians Without Asians holding more responsibility, Hollywood is able to continue with its bad casting decisions and racist stereotypes. <p>Art/Photo Request:</p><p>Is #HollywoodSoWhite still trending? It should be. Time and time again, Hollywood has disappointed with its lack of diversity. Sure, there’s the occasional black protagonist, but there’s more to diversity than just black and white.</p><p>Hollywood consistently delivers Asian stereotypes in its films and oftentimes, movies are “whitewashed” in favor of white actors because of the negative impact of these stereotypes.</p><p>Hollywood’s negative representation of Asians has probably existed since Hollywood’s beginning in 1853. Around the time that Hollywood was starting to gain traction, “yellow peril” was a major fear of the white population in the U.S., Canada, and overseas. This fear stemmed from the idea that whites would be overwhelmed by the influx of East Asian immigrants, contributing to perceptions that Asians would spread their foreign culture and language and would steal jobs. Today, Asian Americans are often labeled intellectual and assimilatory and thus still threatening to white jobs in technology sectors. These perceptions are the origin of Asian stereotypes that are perpetuated in Hollywood to this day.</p><p>These stereotypes lead to active “whitewashing” of films. There is a term called “racial prototypicality” where someone who looks authentically like a certain race is unconsciously given a label based on stereotypes. For example, someone who looks black may be immediately portrayed as violent and harboring delinquency. Asians are viewed as smart in only the STEM fields and as being unable to socialize well. “Whitewashing” is a subset of racial prototypicality in that casting directors unconsciously associate Asian actors with stereotypes that would make Asians unfit to be actors, even in films that are associated with Asians specifically.</p><p>Scarlett Johansson was cast as the lead in the live-action movie “Ghost in a Shell” based on the Japanese anime of the same name. The casting of a white woman instead of an Asian one caused an uproar. In an interview with Marie Claire Magazine, Johansson refuted claims of racism, saying, “Having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity.” Believe it or not, having a franchise with an Asian female protagonist is an even rarer one. Johansson instead claimed that the movie role was about feminism in an attempt to avoid the racism discussion. Excuses like these perpetuate whitewashing by avoiding conversations about its destructive impacts. More people should be addressing the stereotypes and consequent “whitewashing” that occurs in films.</p><p>Marvel’s “Doctor Strange” received backlash for its choice to cast white actor Tilda Swinton to play the role of a Tibetan monk. In August, Netflix released “Death Note,” which is based on a Japanese anime and manga. Like “Ghost in a Shell,” the movie features a predominantly white cast. When trying to audition for the role of protagonist Light Yagami in “Death Note,” one Asian American actor, Edward Zo, stated that he “was told to [his] face that they were not looking to see Asian actors for the role of Light Yagami.” Instead of an Asian actor, Netflix has changed Light Yagami to Light Turner to accommodate for white actor Nat Wolff’s role as the protagonist.</p><p>“The Great Wall” starring Matt Damon is an example of white assimilation on-screen and whitewashing off-screen. The movie is about a European man, William, from medieval times who tries to assimilate into 11th-century Asian society in order to find a rumored substance to improve European life. Such a film demonstrates the concept of white saviorism where the whites save the day with exceptional ability that exceeds that of foreigners.</p><p>Along with white saviorism, negative stereotypes about Asians play into the environment of the movie considerably. The film depicts hundreds of thousands of Chinese warriors ready to fight against the enemy but shows most of them quickly dying in the first few moments of battle as if the Chinese are not capable of defending themselves. William, however, deals more damage with a bow and arrows than the complicated weapons technology that the Chinese have at hand. He also fearlessly dives into the fray to fight for the Chinese even though it is made obvious from the start of the film that William has little intention of helping foreigners with their affairs.</p><p>Off-screen, the movie may have been directed by an Asian and featured a cast of several notable Asian actors, but the storyline was written by at least seven white men. It is mind-boggling how a movie featuring predominantly Asians was not written by any.</p><p>In Hollywood, stereotypes are a large factor in how films are produced and how Asians are viewed in the film industry. Bad associations prevent Asians from playing bigger roles in movies even when those movies require actual Asians. The first step and the only way that Asians can start to have roles in films is to stop audiences and casting directors from harboring negative racist stereotypes that exclude Asians from major roles. People need to stop making excuses and truly address the oppression of Asians in the film industry. Without doing so, one of the largest populations in the world will continuously be judged based on rude misconceptions.</p>	Article	40	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
679	﻿A New Music Video Begins a New Era of Taylor Swift “The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now,” Taylor Swift’s signature red lips murmur. “Why? Oh…’cause she’s dead.” That might just be a... <p>“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now,” Taylor Swift’s signature red lips murmur. “Why? Oh…’cause she’s dead.” That might just be a line in Swift’s new single, “Look What You Made Me Do,” but to me, a self-proclaimed “swiftie,” Swift confirmed what I had been fearing before the single came out. We have officially lost the blonde, curly, love song strumming, pop-country girl who had me hooked on her music. I saw this coming after “Red,” her first album to feature non-country pop songs, debuted. However, even as her catchy single “Shake It Off” and the rest of the songs from “1989” came out, I never lost hope that she might go back to the country style of her older songs. Maybe this was because I had grown so attached to the old Swift that I didn’t want to adjust to a new one, but it is undeniable—Swift has changed, and she’s not going back to her old ways any time soon.</p><p>After accepting Swift’s new style and persona, I had to judge: Do I like the new Taylor? Sure, some parts are catchy, but the main chorus, “look what you made me do, look what you made me do,” sounds incredibly repetitive and unfortunately, does not hold any of the stories or meaning that her older songs, such as “Fearless,” held. Because I disliked the song, I held low expectations for the music video, but once it came out, I watched in awe.</p><p>What Swift did in this video makes a bold statement, one I hadn’t expected coming from an artist who is so constantly talked about for scandals and feuds. In the first scene, a graveyard, Swift is shown crawling out from a grave with an inscription that read, “Taylor Swift’s Reputation.” In the third scene, Swift sits upon a throne crawling with snakes, making her the queen of snakes. Other than describing a reptilian animal, a snake can be used to describe someone who often does traitorous and malicious things behind others’ backs. A snake is not something one normally wants to be called, yet in her video Swift seems to be embracing the label.</p><p>After many feuds with a variety of celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry, Swift’s name has been dragged through the dirt. People consider her someone who can’t be trusted. In these scenes, Swift does something many artists would fear to do: not only does she make it clear that she knows her old, innocent persona is long-gone, but she accepts her new reputation as a snake.</p><p>In the rest of the video, Swift features many references to pop culture events and opinions that have affected her in the public eye. In one scene, she is featured robbing a streaming company, perhaps alluding to the hate she got for refusing to sell her music to streaming companies such as Spotify. She is also spotted wearing a sweater saying “blind for love,” a direct nod toward her infamous dating cycle.</p><p>Though these references are clever, the video set is elaborate, and the overall filming is well done; the best part of the entire video for many swifties like myself is the last 10 seconds—the round-up of Swifts. In this final scene, different versions of Taylor Swift, such as the nerdy Swift from the “You Belong With Me” video and the ballerina Swift from “Shake It Off,” line up in a row in front of a cheering audience. They are shown arguing with each other, the old country Swift is crying while the new goth Swift calls her out for “playing the victim, again.”</p><p>The video ends with a comedic last line, referencing the feud between Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, and Taylor Swift, who is dressed in the exact outfit she was wearing at the 2009 VMA’s when West famously declared Swift unfit for the “Video of the Year Award.” This version of Swift mimics what Swift had said to West and Kardashian, during their most recent dispute: “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.” Swift, yet again, owns up to past actions that have earned her public hate.</p><p>Just like she embraced her reputation of being a snake in the beginning of the video, in this scene, she seems to call herself out on the things that made others angry or annoyed with her. It is unclear whether she did this to say she doesn’t care if they ridicule her actions or because she wants to show others that she understands her past mistakes. Either way, it is interesting and refreshing to see such a high-level celebrity like her bring up unfortunate past events of her lifetime directly into the limelight.</p><p>So is the “new Taylor” better or worse than the “old Taylor”? She’s neither, but she is definitely different. I can’t judge whether her new style and persona is better or worse because I have to keep in mind that I’m not the only “swiftie” out there. The “new” Taylor may be better for some and worse for others, like me. That’s the beauty of Taylor Swift: she attracts such a variety of fans, especially as her musical style changes.</p><p>Even though I wish she would go back to her 2009 self, her change may be for the best. Swift started her official career in 2006 when her debut album, “Taylor Swift,” came out. Since then, she has produced five complete albums and many more individual songs, aged 11 years, and has been involved in endless amounts of drama. I avoided the complete realization of this, but in the time since 2006, Swift was bound to change. Music styles change, fashion changes, and sometimes, due to certain events, even a persona can change. I might not like the songs of the new Taylor, but it’s comforting to know that just like when I was nine and watched the music video of “You Belong With Me” over and over again, Swift’s sense of humor and cleverness regarding music videos has not changed. “Look What You Made Me Do” combines the new Taylor’s attitude and musical style with the old Taylor’s facial expressions and dramatics, creating a whole different Taylor, one as lovable as before.</p>	Article	42	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
680	﻿Seven Years of Ruins At Stake How can the international community resolve the Syrian civil war? <p>The image of a deceased 3-year-old, Alan Kurdni, made headlines around the world on September 25, 2015. Kurdni washed up dead on the shores of a beach after his overcrowded lifeboat, filled with hundreds of refugees, sank in the Mediterranean Sea. Kurdi and the refugees were attempting to travel to Europe to escape the Syrian civil war.</p><p>The conflict in Syria has spanned seven years and is responsible for over 465,000 deaths. After so many casualties, it is important for the international community to bring safety and closure to the Syrian people through long-term treaties, economic sanctions, and humanitarian aid.</p><p>Tensions rose between President Bashar al Assad and the Syrian people in 2011 because of Assad’s intolerance of peaceful anti-regime protests. Assad killed protesters and then began bombing cities, killing innocent civilians. Assad used chemical weapons in August of 2013 to attack Syrians in the suburbs of the capital city, Damascus.</p><p>At this point, international leaders realized that the conflict was only going to get more brutal if they did not intervene. Diplomats initially attempted to a establish a ceasefire. When that failed, they resorted to military intervention. This only escalated the conflict, making it into a proxy war: the militias found support from countries like Iran, who sent large quantities of weapons to the rebel groups in hopes that they would empower Sunni Muslims.</p><p>In addition to being a proxy war, the Syrian civil war has direct, dangerous implications for the U.S. in the form of radicalizing terrorist groups. When the conflict began in 2011, militias rebelling against the Assad regime asked for the support of the United States. The United States never responded, which radicalized rebel groups, making them see the United States as the enemy. These groups would eventually became terrorist groups, one of which is ISIS.</p><p>To find out how the international community can solve this complex issue, I interviewed David Phillips, the Director of the Program on Peace-building and Rights at Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights. Phillips has also worked as the Senior Adviser to the U.S. Department of State.</p><p>In our interview, Phillips noted that this specific conflict is complicated because the victims of oppression often become the aggressors. So, to have a peace deal, Phillips explained, “Everyone who is involved in hostility needs to have their views taken on board and there needs to be an agreement that satisfies all of those different parties.” Peace treaties in Syria should be settled in two ways: long-term treaties and short-term sanctions.</p><p>The first type of peace treaty is permanent and would end the war once and for all. However, it would take years to settle. This type of peace treaty occurs when involved parties call a ceasefire and insist on a long-term “white peace,” which requires formal authorization from the UN Security Council, affected parties, and the Syrian government.</p><p>The alternative is imposing sanctions from the UN or some external power. The militias can negotiate the terms of the sanctions with the third party. If militias don’t follow the terms of the sanctions,  the international community can sanction what is called “All Necessary Measures” under the UN Charter, which means using military force to make the militias cooperate.</p><p>Even if these methods of dividing power are effective, just ending the Syrian civil war doesn't ensure the safety of the Syrian civilians. To ensure a smooth transition to the new political systems, the international community should collaborate with organizations such as The International Center of Transitional Justice, which would hold Assad accountable through amnesty hearings. The International Rescue Committee would also participate by providing humanitarian relief for Syrian refugees settling in camps.</p><p>Ultimately, international community must care about the future of families halfway across the world. We cannot continue to have more children dying like Kurdni. The international community must decide whether it will end seven years of warfare as saviors or destroyers.</p>	Article	140	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
681	Mimbas Remain on the Prowl  <p>After splitting the first two games of the season, the Mimbas are happy but understand that they have room to improve.</p><p>As the final whistle blew in their 7-0, season-opening victory against Baruch College Campus High School, the Stuyvesant Mimbas rejoiced on the sidelines. On both ends of the field, the players did their jobs.</p><p>On defense, the Mimbas felt unchallenged throughout the game. The offense made sure that Baruch could not get open for a short goal shot, leaving the defense untaxed. They controlled the time of possession and kept the ball on Baruch’s side of the field for much of the game. Having six different scorers and seven total goals, the Mimbas showed that they were able to effectively spread the ball around to pressure their opponents on offense.</p><p>Freshman Aki Yamaguchi led the way with two goals and has been a welcome addition to the team. She has shown a potential at practice and will continue to be a force on the offense side of the ball this year and next.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl was extremely happy with the results of weeks of preseason practices and scrimmages. “We connected our passes, which is something we struggled with in the past, and communicated well,” she said.</p><p>After a close 1-0 loss to a strong Bard High School team, the Mimbas dropped a second match to Lab Museum United, 3-2. Yamaguchi and sophomore Selene Kaehny both scored for Stuyvesant in the overtime loss.</p><p>In this close bout, sophomore goalie Emory Walsh had 20 saves, doing her best to keep the team within striking distance. Her exceptional play during the first three games of the season is a pleasant surprise for a team that, at times, struggled on the defensive end last year.</p><p>Even with the two close losses, she and many of her teammates remain confident. They believe that the team has a lot to improve upon, but this start to the season has been positive.  Specifically, the defense has shown itself to be consistent so far and has given up only four goals through three games, compared to 14 during the same stretch last year.</p><p>“I think that we could've done better, but our defense played exceptionally well against their offense,” senior and co-captain Saloni Majmudar said.</p><p>If they can continue with this consistency on defense, then the old adage of defense winning games will allow the team to make another run for the playoffs after a first round exit last year. In addition, revenge against Bard High School or Lab Museum United is not out of the picture either.</p><p>“We can definitely beat them when we rematch them,” Ruhl said. They will face both teams again later in the season, so time will tell if these early losses will be avenged.</p><p>Win or lose, Coach Hugh Francis and the players take what they learn from the games and apply it to their practices. After these three games, the Mimbas have adjusted practices to mimic game situations that they need extra work on, such as throw-ins and corner kicks.</p><p>With only one game a week, the team has the luxury to correct their mistakes from these first few games and gear up for the heart of the season. This extra work combined with a new defensive intensity has given the team the belief that it can compete with anyone.</p>	Article	52	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
682	﻿The Paris Climate Accord While leaving the Paris Climate Accord will present short term economic benefits, its long term effects on the development of America's clean energy industry are... <p>While leaving the Paris Climate Accord will present short term economic benefits, its long term effects on the development of America's clean energy industry are more conspicuous.</p><p>In leaving the climate deal, Trump has ceded a portion of America's leadership of the globe and, in the words of former Secretary of State John Kerry, created a “global stain on our credibility.”</p><p>President Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris Climate Deal is undoubtedly the most pivotal of his short presidency. In the long term, it could become a defining moment of not only Trump’s presidency, but American history. Trump's controversial decision to withdraw from this international agreement will define American and global politics, economics, and the fight against climate change for years to come.</p><p>One of the most immediate repercussions of leaving the climate deal is the diplomatic penalty that comes with leaving an agreement of this magnitude. In leaving, the U.S. joins Nicaragua and Syria as one of the only countries not participating in the international agreement.  Nearly every major world leader has expressed disappointment at this decision, with German chancellor Angela Merkel describing Trump's decision as “extremely regrettable” and the leader of the European council branding it a “big mistake.”</p><p>In addition to worsening​ America's international relationships, this decision will also hamper Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and American diplomatic efforts around the world. In fact, Tillerson had pressured Trump to remain in the climate deal, likely due to his knowledge of the international fallout leaving would cause.</p><p>Further confounding Tillerson is the reduced role the U.S. is now taking in the fight against climate change, leaving China and other competitors as the primary powers determining global climate policy. In leaving the climate deal, Trump has ceded a portion of America's leadership of the globe and, in the words of former Secretary of State John Kerry, created a “global stain on our credibility.”</p><p>The reaction among Americans hasn't been much different. A poll conducted by Politico found that 62 percent of Americans “wanted the U.S. to remain part of the accord.” Many American businesses, cities, and politicians have already condemned the president's decision and pledged to commit themselves to fighting climate change. In fact, a group of businesses, mayors, and governors is attempting to negotiate membership to the agreement with the UN, although they are unlikely to be accepted.</p><p>The main justification used by Trump to defend his decision is economic. There are legitimate economic consequences to abiding by the climate deal, with the Heritage Foundation estimating that it would eliminate 300,000 jobs by 2035, increase household electricity expenditures by 13 to 20 percent, and create a total loss of over 2.5 trillion dollars in GDP. Under the agreement, America had pledged to give three billion dollars to a climate fund, more than double the contribution of the second largest donor. It is understandable that Trump and many of his voters expressed grievances about these economic costs.</p><p>However, leaving the accord is somewhat economically shortsighted. Top American business leaders, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, and ExxonMobil, had expressed support for the accord, arguing that remaining would encourage new investment and create jobs. In leaving the climate deal, Trump moves farther away from an economy​ powered by, and leading the world in, clean energy. The clean energy industry is growing faster than any other energy industry, currently employing over 2.5 million Americans and projected to create many more jobs as it grows. While leaving the Paris Climate Accord will present short term economic benefits, its long term effects on the development of America's clean energy industry are more conspicuous.</p><p>Of course, the entire purpose of the Paris Climate Accord was to limit the increase of global temperatures to two degrees Celsius in the next century. The two degree threshold is considered by many scientists to be the “point of no return,” or the point at which climate change will become irreversible or even catastrophic. Even with the presence​ of the climate deal, many experts had predicted that the world was still on track for over three degrees of warming over the next century.</p><p>The Paris Climate Accord has only reduced the increase in temperature by an estimated 0.2 degrees Celsius more than what had been previously projected. It lacks an enforcement mechanism in the event that a country fails to abide by its pledges. It hopes that over time countries will adopt more ambitious goals and thus further reduce global warming. Without the U.S., the world's largest carbon emitter, the success of the climate deal seems more implausible than ever.</p>	Article	141	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
683	﻿Passing Up PC The unattainable goal that political correctness seeks to achieve has resulted in more stringent limitations on individual freedom, including restrictive speech codes banning words such as “sportsmanship.” <p>“Political correctness” (PC) played a key role in the recent presidential election, with many people flocking in support of Donald Trump because he “says it as it is.” Others expressed revulsion toward what they viewed as comments out of place in American politics. On the other side of the political spectrum, many voters abandoned the “liberal elite” represented by Hillary Clinton after her grouping of Trump supporters into a “basket of deplorables.”</p><p>With this comment, Clinton drew the ire of many Trump supporters and strengthened their belief that their concerns toward issues such as illegal immigration were not being heard. The poor communication between voters in this past election is a side effect of the influence of political correctness on civil rhetoric in our society.</p><p>Political correctness is the deliberate avoidance of language that could offend political sensibilities. While the goal of political correctness was to protect people from hateful speech, it has created an environment adverse to the unregulated exchange of ideas and had a profound effect on freedom of speech across the U.S.</p><p>Offense is a subjective emotion, with individuals experiencing it as a result of a unique set of stimuli. What somebody is offended by depends on their beliefs, morals, and tolerance towards variance from themselves. Because there is such discrepancy in feelings of offense, it is unreasonable to restrict all potentially offensive content.</p><p>Of course, being unwilling to cede control over what ideas can be expressed is not an endorsement of discriminatory rhetoric. It is counterproductive to suppress such rhetoric, especially considering its poor outreach and unconvincing claims. The best method of defeating hateful belief systems is to allow them be expressed in the open, where their lack of productive ideas will become apparent, resulting in an almost certain public rejection.</p><p>Recently, students at Columbia University demanded the removal of a statue of Thomas Jefferson from campus because they took offense to it as a “symbol of violence against black and brown bodies.” These students’ determination to protect the feelings of marginalized groups has caused them to protest for the removal of a statue of a founding father, a symbol of our nation.  These protests constitute an act of censorship.</p><p>Similarly, the job of policing speech often falls into society's hands. Forbes details some methods used to enforce political correctness, ranging from UK colleges banning clapping because it could “trigger anxiety” to a safe-space room founded in Brown University for attendees who “might find debate upsetting.”</p><p>In today's heated political environment, the unrestricted exchange of ideas has become more important than ever. Open discussion allows both ends of the political spectrum a voice, resulting in more inclusive solutions to issues. When the free marketplace of ideas is shut down as it is on college campuses, this mutually beneficial exchange of ideas does not occur. Instead, the political climate becomes more polarized as individuals are drawn to political echo chambers where their beliefs are not only unchallenged, but confirmed.</p><p>The complexity of this notion deepens with subjectivity. Some may claim that without the presence of PC culture, the abstract concept of “freedom” is granted to some but taken away from those aggrieved by so-called hate speech. An open-letter written by a protester furthered that "people talk a lot about 'freedom of speech' and I think this fetish of speech misses the larger point. It is about… who has it, and who is denied it."</p><p>The implementation of PC culture into our society, however, is not a valid solution for eradicating hate speech. Throwing around labels such as “racist” or “sexist” without merit only serves to discredits instances in which their usage would be appropriate--accusations alone could effectively ruin a career. Crying wolf  in the name of political correctness has made it impossible for anyone, in fear of being labelled a “bigot,” to speak out, causing careful tiptoeing around the topic of diversity, or even an avoidance all together. A further constriction on “offensive” speech would not be conducive to a socially just society: rather, it would make it even harder to fight for these causes.</p><p>Stuyvesant, in contrast, boasts a room where profound discourse bounces off trophy-lined walls. With a variety of extracurriculars like debate teams, Young Democrats, the Intellectual  Conservative Society, and The Spectator, a diversity of opinion remains a crucial attribute of our student body. Heated arguments can be heard in the hallways or followed intently on lengthy Facebook comment chains. If a statement is made with malicious intent, it is discredited through intellectual discussion. If an unpopular opinion resonates with a minority, it is heeded—if not fiercely debated—by the rest as a legitimate stance on an issue.</p><p>This attitude is one that needs to be encouraged within youth. PC culture is the barrier between the American people and the freedom of expression. It is unacceptable for it to be fostered in a society, especially one which predicates itself on the latter. As Frederick Douglas once noted, “To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker.” This philosophy, while a rather old one, grounds the existence of civil discourse. It's certainly not time to forsake it.</p>	Article	142	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
684	﻿Harry Styles: A New Era Harry Styles breaks away from his boy band roots and draws inspiration from ‘70s British rock in his debut album. <p>“Just stop your crying, it’s a sign of the times / Welcome to the final show / Hope you’re wearing your best clothes.” These are the first lines that Harry Styles sings in his solo debut single, “Sign of the Times,” which was released on April 7, 2017. These lyrics hold powerful and passionate emotions—things that the general public may not have expected a member of One Direction to be capable of.</p><p>One Direction members Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, and Harry Styles decided to take a hiatus over a year ago. With promises to come back soon, they have been working on solo projects, and Styles is no exception, having decided to take a different approach to music.</p><p>In One Direction, Styles was known as the frontman, singing most of the solos and carrying the chorus. However, he did not write many of the songs and did not have a lot of control over the types of songs he was allowed to sing.</p><p>One Direction’s style in their earlier years fits more of a stereotypical boy band, with most of their songs about young love and relationships. Their music style became more mature beginning with their third album, “Midnight Memories,” which contains some rock elements, but was still predominantly pop.</p><p>However, Styles’s new type of music has no traces of pop music. He released his solo debut album “Harry Styles,” which features 10 songs, including soft ballads like “Two Ghosts” and hard rock anthems like “Kiwi,” on May 19, 2017. As entertainment journal “Variety” describes his album: “[It’s] rock and it’s roll, but it’s also soft and sensitive.”</p><p>When asked about the versatility of his tracks, Styles replied, “I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that instead of picking a sound and writing 10 of the same things.”</p><p>The self-titled album may have very different songs, but they all have one thing in common: they include Styles pouring out all his feelings.</p><p>In one of his slower songs “Meet Me in the Hallway,” he sings, “Just let me know, I’ll be at the door, at the door / Hoping you’ll come around / Just let me know I’ll be on the floor, on the floor / Maybe we’ll work it out / I gotta get better, gotta get better.”</p><p>Styles croons about still wanting someone to return, even when he has been hurt by the person before. It has a very pretty and light tone and sounds perfect for a choir to sing. This song has a Pink Floyd vibe to it, especially when compared to the song, “Breathe (In the Air).” Both songs are very sweet-sounding, and both David Gilmour and Harry Styles stretch out the lyrics to make the words sound like echoes.</p><p>Another song that stands out from the album is Styles’s debut single “Sign of the Times,” which is commonly described as a bold choice. It’s unusual for a five-minute rock song about dying and the end of a life to debut at number one on the iTunes charts. The song starts off with slow and mellow piano chords, but sharply changes when there is a dramatic drumming to a full-on rock reverie.</p><p>Styles doesn’t disappoint with his vocals either. In the last minute of the song, he holds out long notes and hits the high notes with ease as he repeats, “We got to get away, we got to get away,” and “We got to, we got to run” various times. He also uses a falsetto in the pre-chorus, which he sings effortlessly.</p><p>“Sign of the Times” definitely has a David Bowie feel to it, made clear with the choir, the guitar sound, the space theme, and the cabaret atmosphere. Bowie is known for his galactic, science fantasy feel to his music; one of his most famous albums, “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,” actually centers around an alien who is also a rock-n-roll superstar. Styles mimics this quality with the use of guitars and drums to set the atmosphere for a space-y rock ballad.</p><p>In fact, most of Styles’s album seems to be inspired by the British rock star. His song “Only Angel” begins with a soft and instrumental tune that lasts for a minute until the atmosphere rockets to rock with Styles screaming “HEY! HEY!” This is quite similar to one of Bowie’s most famous songs, “Life On Mars?” with the dramatic change of mood in the song and the use of background singers.</p><p>Not all of Styles’s songs on this album are packed full with emotions and poignancy though. In “Kiwi,” he shows that he can have a fun time and let loose when he screams, “Oh, I think she said ‘I’m having your baby, it’s none of your business,’” multiple times. This song is surely a song to blast out from your speakers on a weekend night to displease your parents. It’s very upbeat and energetic, stocked with guitar riffs and intense drumming that will make you want to scream along to Styles.</p><p>In Styles’s debut solo album, he breaks out of his shell, both lyrically and musically. The boy-band superstar has matured and is now playing with his limits and exploring new types of music with the help of inspirations like Pink Floyd and David Bowie.</p>	Article	147	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
685	﻿Riverdale: The New Breakfast Club “Riverdale,” a television series adapted from “Archie Comics,” is refreshing as it was modified to be diversified; it has all of the desirable elements of a teenage drama without being too corny. <p>Now that “Riverdale” is officially on Netflix, it is the perfect television show to binge-watch, whether you're procrastinating or just browsing. Adapted from the “Archie Comics,” “Riverdale” takes a dark, offbeat reimagining of the popular series. The new teen drama immerses itself in the eerie mystery of Jason Blossom’s (Trevor Stines) murder. It has all of the desirable elements of a teenage drama—a striking cast, high school stereotypes, (scandalous) romantic relations, social pressure, and popular trends—without being too corny.</p><p>The heart of “Riverdale” lies within the cast: Archie (KJ Apa), Betty (Lili Reinhart), Jughead (Cole Sprouse), and Veronica (Camila Mendes). “Riverdale” spins the classic whodunit mystery into a compelling coming-of-age narrative. These quippy teenagers confront the somber calling of the adult world. Entangled in the adults’ thick web of lies, they unravel the truth thread by thread.</p><p>The television series chucks away the comic’s old cliches for a noir Breakfast Club meets “Riverdale” ambience. Older readers of the “Archie Comics” would blush at this radical reimagining of their beloved classic. This new Archiverse is filled with not only shadings of incest and inappropriate student-teacher relationships, but a web of corruption from embezzlement to drug dealings.</p><p>As the comic book title suggests, “Archie Comics” centers around the typical all-American boy Archibald “Archie” Andrews. The comic’s main plot line consists of Archie chasing after Betty and Veronica. The love triangle is present in almost every digest and double digest. There are sometimes additional love interests, like Cheryl Blossom and Valerie Smith. The comics focus on Archie grabbing lunch, going to the beach, ogling at other girls, and other typical teenage outings.</p><p>“Riverdale” transformed the Archiverse’s plot beyond the gang’s innocent small-town shenanigans. They took the comic’s famous landmark, Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe and turned it into a more sinister-looking diner where the teens not only bond together, but discover the town’s grim secrets. In both “Riverdale” and the comics, Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe serves as a center of civic life for the teens to foster their friendships.</p><p>The meaningful friendships give the audience the impression that the cast members are real and dynamic characters. For instance, in the show, Archie and Jughead’s brotherhood creates a heartfelt response. Impressively, “Riverdale” creates another unexpected dynamic duo. In the comics, Betty and Veronica were eternal rivals for Archie’s love. Fortunately, “Riverdale” steps away from this stereotypical trope, and instead makes Betty the sugar to Veronica’s spice. This notion is revealed through several different scenes, in which they work together to achieve common goals. Their feminist approach is conveyed as they attack the controversial issue of victim-blaming; in one episode, they led a group of victimized girls to expose the football team who objectified hem.</p><p>No worries if you didn't read the comics though, because the plot is simply too good to pass up. From the same network that produced “Gossip Girl” and “Vampire Diaries,” you're bound to fall in love with the characters and their dilemmas. Much like with “Gossip Girl” and “Vampire Diaries,” there are also major similarities between “Riverdale” and “Twin Peaks” as well as “Pretty Little Liars”; the pilot episode starts off with the popular kid being missing and the whole town being shaken by it. Not only that, but it is filled with redheads, which is pretty rare in the showbiz.</p><p>The cast is pretty dreamy, from nostalgic ‘90s stars to rising actors and actresses. These ‘90s stars include Luke Perry, Mädchen Amick, Casey Cott, and Molly Ringwald, all of whom are parents to the main characters. Rising actresses include Camila Mendes, Lili Reinhart, Madelaine Petsch, Shannon Purser, and Ross Butler. Cole Sprouse is also reintroduced to the showbiz, as he debuts as Jughead in this series. Some of the rising actors and actresses are relatively underrated and use this chance to introduce themselves to the media. Nonetheless, there is great chemistry between all of the actors and actresses on stage. Like Cole Sprouse said, “We all showed up on set and it was magic. As a cast, we get along like peas in pods.”</p><p>As the comics were written in the late ‘30s, CW made changes to create an adaptation that diversified the cast. Josie and the Pussycats was an all-girl rock band featured in “Archie Comics”; two-thirds of them were white in the comics, but all of them are black in the television show. Reggie Mantle was a sarcastic womanizing jock, who was also white in the comics, but with Ross Butler casted as this character, he is breaking Asian stereotypes and giving Asians the representation they deserve. The LGBTQ+ community is also represented as well—in the comics and in the TV show—with Kevin Keller as the first openly gay character. Though Kevin is seen as the “gay best friend” archetype throughout the TV show, he also plays a critical role in the development of the plot. Like the other straight main characters, his romances are caught in the adults’ lies, thus normalizing his gay sexuality. Though there have been many changes made to “Archie Comics,” “Riverdale” is definitely more inclusive of underrepresented groups, forming connections between its characters and audience.</p>	Article	150	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
686	﻿A Movie As Confusing and Glorious As Its Name Buster’s Mal Heart chronicles the almost psychedelic overtones of two men in their journeys to discover their true selves. <p>“I can’t believe it.” These are a few of only several dozen words that our protagonist, later to be known as Buster (Rami Malek), utters, and they perfectly summarize the despair the movie summons as a backdrop for its audience.</p><p>In the first few moments of the 2017 film, “Buster’s Mal Heart,” we see the identical silhouettes of two men sitting in a small boat with a backdrop of the sun and a glimmering sea. At this time, the identities of both are a mystery and they look more like small toys than actual people. The scene cuts to the roar of a gunshot and a panicked Buster running for his life in what appears to be a remote, mountainous region.</p><p>“Buster’s Mal Heart” follows the growing illusions of Jonah (Rami Malek), a family man who works as a night shift hotel concierge. We see him going through the cycles of someone who can barely keep himself together. He struggles to make money in his “dead-end job,” but constantly reminds his wife of their—or rather his—dream to get a farm and live off the land. He is quiet, resolute, and harbors the need of a wild spirit trying to break free of the traditional boundaries given to him.</p><p>The movie switches between this and the endeavors of Buster, also played by Rami Malek, to avoid a crew of considerably simple-minded, watered-down versions of state troopers while trying to spread the word about the oncoming Y2K, the prophesied end of the world.</p><p>Buster is the exact opposite of Jonah. He is boisterous and leaves reminders of his presence in the way that an animal would. He randomly calls radio talk shows and live psychic readings, trying to convince people that “the Inversion is coming.”</p><p>For the second time in five minutes, the title of the movie is shown with its inverted text. The reflection of the title is not a random choice of fun text effects. It’s a revelation to the fact that the movie will constantly be presenting viewers with two dark and different realities.</p><p>At first, the film is confusing. We aren’t presented with much information to start with, and at the end of it all, there still isn’t a lot of extra context. There is instead a strong preference to “show” and not “tell,” forcing viewers to play a psychological mind game to piece together the various gaps in the storyline, such as, “Who is Buster? What does he want? Why does he always look like a deer in the headlights? And what’s with his obsession with adult onesies?”</p><p>A profound set of events that changes Jonah’s life and possibly turns him into Buster the mountain man is scattered in bits and pieces throughout the film. During early scenes of Jonah in his night shift as a hotel concierge, we see him watching a sketchy, pixelated screen of an aging scientist yelling that “the Inversion is coming!” This alludes to the aforementioned Y2K, or Year 2000 bug.</p><p>At the crack of dawn, a tall stranger comes into the hotel asking for a room. Jonah is suspicious as he has no existing I.D. at all and carries a bag full of a questionable white substance. Jonah asks for a name but never gets one. The only reference to this tall stranger is “the Last Free Man” (DJ Qualls). The LFM is already irritating Jonah with his shady appearance and lack of clarity, but insists on telling Jonah about his quest as an “exterminator of glitches.” He fixes them and makes them go away.</p><p>The appearance of the LFM marks the beginning of Jonah’s deterioration as the life-altering events that follow drive him to insanity.</p><p>The movie is not afraid to delve into the most violent recesses of the conscious mind. It addresses the dark side of human nature in the way Buster immerses himself in his quest to escape the end of the world. Jonah emphasizes what it means to carry out thoughts that many wouldn’t think to perform, such as the accidental murder of his wife and child.</p><p>The film portrays the concept of darkness as a mentally changeable substance that allows for activities such as locking people in their basements and pretending to be someone who is long dead to become daily occurrences.</p><p>However, this movie tries to be unbiased when it comes to giving the audience members free reign over what they want to think. We see Jonah talking to his daughter affectionately and Buster gently feeding an elderly couple, who are held hostage, in their mountain home.</p><p>We receive seemingly intertwined events occurring in the lives of Jonah and Buster, convincing us that they are one and the same, but suddenly, we are not so sure when confronting Buster’s rebellious and sometimes rude attitude, which contrasts with Jonah’s well-meaning and comforting tones.</p><p>Everything from Jonah’s encounter with “the Last Free Man” to Buster’s uncanny patience, control, and transformation of self in his search for the meaning of his beliefs gives the audience thinking space.</p><p>We are allowed to conceive an appropriate identity for two men, or perhaps only one, that goes against the will of a perceived god and universe. We learn that Buster’s journey is not about him running away from what he did, but rather his quest for the meaning of his life. We are forced to ask questions that can help us define the Buster we know in this movie.</p><p>Jonah thinks it’s fine for his daughter to watch slightly age-inappropriate cartoons, so we must ask more questions to understand what contributes to such odd fatherly moments as this and what led to his eventual collapse.</p><p>With a movie that favors dark, overpowering tones and a sweeping narrative to carry almost unrelated details of its main characters to light, this film makes for a strange but exhilarating ride.</p>	Article	151	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
687	﻿Art on the Streets An outdoor exhibit draws the crowds near Washington Square Park. <p>A biannual outdoor art show, the Washington Square Art Exhibit, has been around for more than 80 years. It all started in 1931, during the Great Depression, when a few local artists decided to showcase and hopefully sell some of their work. The founder, Jackson Pollock, desperately in need of funds to pay the rent for a studio in Greenwich Village, took a few of his paintings and set them up on the sidewalks near Washington Square Park. He was soon joined by fellow village artists in the same financial situation.</p><p>After a while, the crowd of artists grew, attracting more and more passersby to stop and look. Many of their works were purchased, and the event was even noted by luminaries of the art world such as Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, founder of the Whitney Museum of Art, and Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Director of the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>As the years went by, what began as a small fair evolved into a massive exhibit featuring artists from all over the world. Artists from New York, New Jersey, Washington D.C, and even China gathered to put together an impressive show. As of today, the exhibit takes place every Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend, on the sidewalks of University Place from East 13th Street south to Waverly Place. It is now a showcase of art from diverse backgrounds, where people can be exposed to the diversity of art forms and where artists can be rewarded for their outstanding pieces. The exhibit didn’t lose its original purpose either, since artists whose works have been selected by judges can still receive cash prizes, donated by individuals, in support of their work.</p><p>The most recent exhibit this past Memorial day started at around noon. The sidewalks around Washington Square Park were encompassed in a casual, lighthearted atmosphere. The seven to eight blocks were filled with small, white booths displaying works of the exhibitor, some of which even played music.</p><p>Being open to the public, the exhibit attracted a wide range of audiences, varying from students to parents and children to the elderly. As the viewers walked down the neatly decorated blocks, they could admire the artworks, purchase souvenirs, and even chat with the artists about their work. Regardless of whether the viewers have been exposed to much art, many of them appreciated this opportunity to see and experience such a diverse range of pieces.</p><p>The artworks showcased came from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, as the artists themselves come from around the world. There were realist, impressionist, and cubist paintings, depicting scenes from nature and scenery to skyscrapers and city life. One piece showed the Brooklyn Bridge with the rough strokes on the water resembling Claude Monet’s “Sunrise.” And while paintings of New York City were the most common, each represented a different style, a different way of viewing the city. Some portrayed the place as a busy commercial center while others emphasized its beauty and harmony.</p><p>Other paintings expressed abstract ideas, which the artists further developed as they explained their work to the viewers. Unlike traditional museums, the artists stayed by their artworks to discuss their inspirations, life experiences, and what pushed them to create their art pieces. Many viewers found it was interesting how what could have seemed like patches of color could mean something so much more after considering the artist’s perspective.</p><p>Aside from paintings, the exhibit also incorporated photography and handcrafts into the already diverse art forms, adding variety to the event. Photographs featured landscape and environment as well as people and urban settings, while handcrafts included sculptures, jewelry, clocks, and handkerchiefs.</p><p>With its unique charm, the Washington Square Art Exhibit stands out even in a busy city like New York. The diversity of the art it incorporates helps it appeal to a wide range of people. The event promotes art as a facet of the city’s culture and allows city dwellers to become more aware of the art around them. It wins the applause of many citizens, which continues to drive the event as it progresses with each passing year.</p><p>[a]i put the 'so what'/'why does it matter' part in the conclusion i hope thats okay :)</p>	Article	152	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
688	﻿From a '30s Shoe Store to a Warm Candy Haven: The Legacy of Economy Candy A little look into the famous mom-and-pop candy shop Economy Candy. <p>If you’re anything like me, one of the things that you cherish about New York City is the variety of little, family-run shops that practically dominate—or at least used to dominate—the city. Sometimes we forget that these shops have real, hardworking people and a rich history behind them.</p><p>One of my favorite places in the entire city lies in the heart of one of the most historic parts of the city: the Lower East Side. At 108 Rivington Street stands the now 80-year-old candy store, Economy Candy. Packed to the ceiling with virtually every type of sugary treat from the classic chocolate bars to the myriad of jelly bean machines at the back of the shop, it delivers a bit of a sensory overload when walking in.</p><p>The atmosphere is an immediate time warp. It’s nothing like many candy stores of today, which have neon walls, bright colors everywhere, and glass cases (like Dylan’s Candy Bar or Itsugar). Rather, entering Economy Candy is like walking into a small mom-and-pop shop crowded with candies in boxes hastily put on tables and shelves. These boxes are everywhere, packed up to the ceiling and all the way to the very back of the store, making it seem as if the entire store itself is made of candy.</p><p>I knew that this little gem of a place must have a rich history as I had heard that it had been around for a while. After a quick chat with the friendly owner Mitchell Cohen, the original owner’s grandson, I found that the store has been around since 1937 and was originally a shoe store. He recounts, “Well, we used to be on the corner [of] Essex Street, and it was a shoe store. During the war, we used to get candy and sell it; it oversold the shoes and we decided, ‘Why not make this a candy store?’”</p><p>Like any store that has been around for a substantial length of time, the store has evolved with the area. Cohen recalled, “You know, in the ‘60s and ‘70s, it was really bad down here. The Lower East Side was a drug haven [with] bars; we’d close shop and look both ways to make sure we wouldn’t get mugged, you know? [There was a lot] of thievery; it wasn’t a good neighborhood.” He smiled and said, “But we held out and it got better, and look where we are now. We were at a low point and now we’re at the high [point].”</p><p>Economy Candy is the cornerstone of a cute family business. From its vast collection of familiar and rare candies to its bubbly ambiance, it has everything a kid (or an adult) could possibly dream of. It’s a historic landmark that everyone can enjoy.</p>	Article	155	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
885	﻿Textbooks and Pointe Shoes: The Secret Life of Dr. Greenwald Before Dr. Greenwald was a teacher here at Stuy, she was a ballet student. In this article, she reflects on her experiences with ballet and how it has affected her life. <p>“You know, there’s something magical about the beauty of ballet,” describes history teacher Dr. Lisa Greenwald. Before teaching young students about history, she was a student learning ballet. She still dances ballet, but in a modified and less intense format. However, her experiences dancing ballet have affected her life in a large way, and now, she reflects on her life with ballet.</p><p><b>What sparked your interest in ballet?</b></p><p>What sparked my interest in ballet were two things: my mother took me to a creative movement class when I was about four. I got to run around the studio and pretend I was a butterfly or a rainbow. Then, she took me to see The Nutcracker at Lincoln Center, and I said, “I want to be like that.”</p><p><b>Did ballet classes live up to its competitive environment stereotype? Can you trust anyone?</b></p><p>There’s competition everywhere. Indeed it’s a very “only the top dancers get in anywhere [environment],” but you’d be surprised at how much camaraderie there is. In a performance, 99 percent of all ballet dancers are in the background, so the chances that you’re going to be a principal dancer are very few. But even if you’re a principal dancer, you have to dance with other people. The only way you can study in a school for hours a day with the same people is for them to be your family, to work together, and enjoy dancing together. My daughter’s a dancer, and when she’s on stage, she absolutely loves it, because she’s exchanging glances and communicating with everybody else onstage.</p><p><b>How did it feel going from regular ballet shoes to pointe shoes? Was it a turning point in your life?</b></p><p>Lots of girls want to put on pointe shoes, because they look really magical, and you get to stand on your toes. Only, that hurts. And it particularly hurt in those days. Technology has improved things, so nowadays, there’s all sorts of materials that you can put in your shoes, and even the shoes themselves have evolved. In order to really dance well on your toes, you need to do it all the time. I did it sometimes, but it wasn’t every day for two hours to three hours a day, and that's what dancers who are practicing to become professionals do every day. My daughter dances on pointe every day, and her feet are incredibly strong. I always say that her feet should be registered as a lethal weapon. It’s meant to look magical on stage, but you could be in excruciating pain with a smile on your face.</p><p><b>How did it feel to be on stage and to perform in front of a live audience?</b></p><p>Being on stage is a strange thing. If you’re really on stage and you’re surrounded by stage lights, you generally look out and it’s black, and that can be very intimidating, to just see the blackness all around you. I don’t think I ever got used to that sense, because I didn’t perform enough, and I never got used to it. But my daughter, who performs in multiple performances every year, loves that. For her, coming onto the stage in the flood of light, darkness all around, that just lights her up. For me, I felt almost at sea, or too vulnerable. But again, that’s about discipline. If you do it all the time, you get used to it. And I just didn’t do it enough to get used to it.</p><p><b>How did ballet classes change you as a person or impact you as a teacher?</b></p><p>They changed me enormously. I think this goes for anybody who studies any kind of art form seriously: you know that the only way to get good at that [art] is to drill it intensely. You also know that what you put in, you get out. It means that if you want to just enjoy dancing with other people and be pretty good at it, then you have to practice it somewhat, but you don’t have to practice it five hours a day. If you want to be the best ballet dancer, then yes, you have to practice six to seven days a week, all day. It is a very visceral experience. And I think that’s a lesson for life: you get what you put into it.</p><p>The other thing that it taught me, which goes against the grain of a lot of high school education, is that direct teaching from teachers is enormously valuable. Your teachers are the experts: they model [ballet] and show it to you. And it made me have an enormous appreciation for my teachers. I enjoyed having teachers and showing them appreciation for what they gave me. You really learn how to show full appreciation and respect for your teachers when you’re studying something outside of the classroom.</p><p>It’s also funny because, in the end, I realized that [ballet classes impacted me], but not at the time. When I went to my ballet teacher’s memorial service, I listened to everyone talk about him, saying, “We loved when he did this; we loved when he did that.” I thought, “Oh my goodness, those were things that I tried to bring to my classroom. They totally impacted the way I teach: the way I ask a lot of my students and try to give a lot. I really believe that my students can achieve a lot. I just have to help them get there, but I don't have this idea that some people are just dumb and some are just smart. I really don’t believe that.</p><p><b>Why did you choose to pursue a doctorate instead of pursuing a career in dance?</b></p><p>There are a bunch of reasons for that. In high school, I really enjoyed dancing ballet. I studied with really good ballet teachers and performed on occasion. It was very meaningful to me and to my life. But I did not practice enough to try to become a professional.</p><p>Also, I probably wouldn’t have physically been able to do it. Ballet has specific requirements. To be a professional, you need to have a degree of flexibility, and your feet have to be structured in such a way that you can withstand professional dancing.</p><p>Even in high school, I had a sense that over the long term, a more intellectual profession would be more satisfying. And the chances of my becoming a successful professional dancer were slim, so I wanted to go to college. A piece of me regretted not having tried to dance professionally because I loved dancing and because I don't like giving up on activities I've committed myself to, but I think I made the right choice.</p><p><b>Can you tell us more about your ballet experiences?</b></p><p>[My time in Paris] was such an important part of my life. I ended up learning French and living and breathing French. I spoke French all the time and spent my days reading French. I had many French friends who I still hold as my dearest friends. Most importantly, my eldest daughter was born in France, so I became a mother in France.</p><p>For immigrants and the first generation, you really live between two cultures. You straddle being an American but having another side: your culture of origin. I’m a third generation immigrant. My father's grandparents came from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and spoke German and Yiddish. My mother's great-grandparents came from the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire (the only part of Russia where most Jews were allowed to live)—probably in what is present day Ukraine—but I'm not sure as I don't have the records and haven't had time to do the research yet. My parents were so Americanized that there was little from the Old World that they brought to me. So it was an incredible experience to live in another culture and speak in another language. You’re living in this other world that has different values and expectations. I became a mother in France, and my expectations of parenting were different than that of many New York moms.</p><p>In France, I took full advantage of everything a different culture had to offer. I went to museums; I studied with this ballet dancer from the Paris Opera; I went to theater and saw films; I traveled a lot around France and hung out with friends. I lived with my husband, [who] also spoke fluent French. He was a journalist who worked in France, so we really had a very meaningful life in a different country. That’s why I love this population of students at Stuy who speak different languages, have different experiences with different cultures, and move in and out of different languages without thinking about it. It was special for me then, so I appreciate it now.</p><p><b>What are your favorite and least favorite things about ballet?</b></p><p>Well, as a ballet teacher of mine used to say, “ballet is many things; comfortable is not one of them.” As I get older, it hurts, and because I don’t want to stop dancing, I’ve had to modify my dancing, so that I don’t hurt myself. That has been a sort of slow and painful process. About 10 years ago, I discovered I had a hip injury, and I thought I would never dance again. I actually thought I would never walk again properly and that I would never not have pain again, because that’s what a doctor had told me. Until I went to a physical therapist. And so, I remember saying to myself, “Oh my goodness, I can never dance again.” My physical therapist said, “Yes, you can. You just have to modify what you do”.</p><p>When she said that I thought, okay, I’m never going to complain again. I’m just going to do what I can do and not hurt myself. I just am happy when I can get through a ballet class without being in pain. Very low expectations, I know! But, there is something about ballet for me that I just come back to. I keep on thinking that I really need to stop this [ballet] soon, but what else can I do? And people will say, why don’t you just do modern dance? Why don’t you just do pilates? I’m just like, “meh.” I don’t want to exercise. You know, there’s something magical about the beauty of ballet and trying to have a beautiful line, to beautiful music, and trying to really express the music in your body in incredibly subtle ways using the motion of your body. I dance every week. It’s fun to take class with my daughter; I keep saying to her, “You can't stop taking ballet because then we won't be able to dance together.” I can’t figure out a substitute for ballet now, but I’m hoping it will come to me, and I’m hoping I won’t be in a situation where my body decides I need to stop.</p><p><b>If you were to go back in time, would you keep the experiences, or which part of the experience would you change?</b></p><p>If I could go back in time, I would probably have not taken my ballet studies as much for granted. I think I probably would have done more but then I would have become a different person. I wouldn't have done the other things that I did. I probably would not have become a professional dancer. I could've become a failed ballet dancer.</p><p><b>How did you react to failure when you were dancing?</b></p><p>It’s a very intense place. There is no room for being a cry baby. You pick yourself up and brush yourself off. I used to have exercise-induced asthma when I was a kid, and so I would sometimes gulp air, and my instructor would make fun of me and say I looked like a fish. What was I going to do? Cry? I mean, it just makes you tough and resilient. It makes you able to absorb criticism constructively and move on and not take it into the core of yourself. You say to yourself, “Oh, he or she is correcting what I’m doing, not who I am. They might not even care about who I am. They are there to make dancers.” I think that’s an excellent lesson that goes back for hundreds of years. You are not inventing things, you are a student, and once you become an expert or master, then you can go on to invent things. But you are studying a discipline, and I think studying a discipline is a very profound experience because it's bigger than you.</p><p><b>If you had to sum up “How To Ballet” in a few words, what would you say?</b></p><p>Discipline. Always working for perfection and understanding that is impossible, but working for it anyway. Just really appreciating the beauty of the movement. It’s not a sport, it’s an art. There are many girls who dance ballet nowadays where you just don’t see the art. You need to have the art, more than you need to have your leg next to your ear, more than the triple pirouette. You need the art, the aesthetics, the beauty of it. It takes a lot of hard work and discipline. Believe me, ballet dancers are not floating through air. It’s tough, tough, tough.</p>	Article	283	2017-12-21 16:34:17.536636	2017-12-21 16:34:17.536636
889	﻿Democrats and Women: Making the Same Mistake Yet, the Democratic party—which claims to be firmly opposed to sexual assault—has had a totally underwhelming response. <p>But Democrats are failing to see the obvious—sexual assault is still sexual assault.</p><p>Upwards of 40 actresses have come forth to condemn acclaimed film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault in the last couple of months. Inspired by the willingness of these A-listers to speak out, dozens of women have been stepping forward as victims, accusing famous men such as Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, and many more of sexual assault and harassment. Yet, the Democratic party—which claims to be firmly opposed to sexual assault—has had a totally underwhelming response.</p><p>The infamous “Weinstein scandal” is hardly the first time Democrats have disappointed in the face of outrage in America. Preventing sexual harassment continues to be a cause championed by politicians since the Clinton era, when former president Bill Clinton had an infamous affair with an office intern, Monica Lewinsky. Democrats such as Bill de Blasio and Kirsten Gillibrand claim that if the same scandal had occurred today, Clinton would be forced to resign.</p><p>But it’s much easier to make these statements about an ex-president whose governing days are well in the past than about a politician who can sway the future of the Democratic party. A new wave of allegations have surfaced in the past several weeks blaming Senator Al Franken for the inappropriate groping of four women. Franken has done little to deny the accusations, telling the Minneapolis Star Tribune “I don’t remember these photographs, I don’t. This is not something I would intentionally do.”</p><p>To be sure, Republicans aren’t in the clear either. Senatorial candidate Roy Moore has been similarly plagued by accusations just before a crucial election. The 70-year-old Alabama native continues to deny any sexual misconduct as growing numbers of women are coming forth to condemn him for past behaviors, such as forcibly groping and kissing minors.</p><p>The important distinction here lies with the reaction: immediately after the first stone was thrown in Moore’s direction, Democrats came out of the woodwork to demand he step aside from the race. Even Republicans ( Ted Cruz, John McCain, Paul Ryan) immediately called for Moore to give up his chance at the seat, chastising everything from Moore’s actions to his character to his ethics.</p><p>Al Franken, however, has been granted immunity to criticism from Democrats because of his politics, revealing the hypocrisy in their movement. Of course, he’s gotten the customary slap on the wrist from his party, and a small influx of criticisms, but nowhere near the extent of the backlash Moore’s received. Even though Moore was the same man who, ironically, gained fame after his refusal to remove a statue of the Ten Commandments from a government building, his alleged convictions should remain separate from his actions.</p><p>Yet, even Franken’s fellow party members remained relatively silent, and the female cast from his time on SNL went so far as to defend Franken in an open letter. A recent article by the Washington Post, titled “I’m a Feminist. I Study Rape Culture. And I Don’t Want Al Franken to Resign,” even claims, “Sexual harassment and assault are simply too widespread for Democrats to respond to Franken’s offense with only Franken in mind.” Franken—because of his earlier advocacy for sexual assault victims—is essentially being given a free pass by Democrats. Excuses ranging from his viability as a candidate to comparatively less egregious behavior in comparison to Moore’s all diminish the fault in Franken’s actions. They feed off his prior status as an “ally” of women to pardon the hypocrisy of his own past.</p><p>And though Franken recently resigned, he walked away from the Senate while commenting on the “irony” of his situation, saying, “I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office...” The Senator, who built his career on pointing out moral depravity in the Republican party, refuses to acknowledge it within himself. Franken’s departure in disgrace was followed by retorts toward his accusers and claims of “unfairness.” Actions truly speak louder than words, and Franken’s commentary drowned out any attempts (or lack thereof) to right his past.</p><p>Yet Democrats continue making such sizable mistakes. About two decades after Clinton’s scandal, his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, ran for president. The crux of her campaign was progressing women’s rights, yet her behavior suggested an opposite intent.</p><p>After her husband fell under heavy scrutiny, Hillary viciously attacked all the women who accused him of harassment, even calling Lewinsky a “narcissistic loony toon” and deeming all similar accusations as completely fabricated. In Clinton’s earlier days as a lawyer, she helped acquit a child rapist while fully believing he was guilty, as later revealed when she laughed about the case in a taped interview.</p><p>Even recently, Hillary accepted donations from countries such as Saudi Arabia (which alone gave upward of $25 million) that commit glaring human rights abuses against women. Yet the Democratic party has remained silent throughout all of these transgressions, with many politicians proudly having backed Hillary as a candidate and as a human being. As long as her morals shone bright in the ballot box, and there was a prospect of an establishment Democrat holding office, there seemed little incentive for further investigation.</p><p>Democrats are failing to see the obvious: sexual assault is still sexual assault. And if they want to set a proper precedent, they must denounce all men convicted of it and all people who continue to defend it, despite political beliefs. They must address the threat of “false allegations,” allowing for their investigation and certainly for lawmakers to make their case. But if they hold validity—which, more often than not, these allegations do—it’s high time for Democrats to stop defending accused men because of their political standing.</p><p>If Democrats want to maintain the trust of voters, then they need to stop this perpetual cycle of suppression within their own party. Politicians are too frightened to set a precedent, but as soon as “supporting women’s rights” is more than just a mantra, they can finally start uniting the American people.</p>	Article	287	2017-12-21 17:45:54.375916	2017-12-21 17:45:54.375916
892	﻿Transforming Apathy to Awareness Stuyvesant, like any other high school, has a responsibility to address student harassment issues through a gender studies course. <p>I’ve always been a feminist, even before I knew what the term “feminism” meant. I was never expected to act a certain way because I am a girl, and my parents made that known by treating me and my brother equally. To this day, I equate feminism to personal empowerment.</p><p>Yet 43 percent of men and women describe feminism as “angry,” and 30 percent as “outdated,” according to a 2016 Washington Post poll. These labels are some of the many misconceptions surrounding the fight for gender equality in the United States. Harassment, not just of gender, but on the basis of race, religion, and sexual orientation, is still a widespread issue in American schools. An effective way to battle such harassment is through awareness, specifically by instituting a mandatory gender studies course.</p><p>Gender studies is a field devoted to gender identity and representation. Intersectionality, or how people of different race, gender, and sexuality experience discrimination or oppression on different levels, plays a major part in this field. Topics covered in the course would range from feminism to LGBTQ+ history to racial discrimination to sexual harassment.</p><p>This course would deal with serious and sensitive issues. This class would strive for both an educational and accepting atmosphere. Unlike other classes, participation would not affect students’ grades, so that students who are shy or sensitive about the topic of gender would not feel pressured to speak out. Grades would instead be determined by a student’s attentiveness, whether they complete all homework, and whether they aim to apply the course to their everyday lives. The purpose of this course is for all students to become aware of the history of minorities and underrepresented groups, how far they’ve come, and how much there is still to be done in terms of reaching equality.</p><p>Gender studies needs to be mandatory in school to ensure that everyone, both male and female, understands equality. According to the same Washington Post poll, 50 percent of men do not identify as feminists. In every category, men were more withdrawn or opposed to feminism than women. Feminism affects women more than men, but the fight for gender equality will not reach its fullest potential if only women support it.</p><p>The class would emphasize the damaging effects of harassment. The ideas enforced by gender studies are just as important to victims of harassment as they are to harassers. While schools emphasize zero tolerance for harassment of any sort in society, students should also make the effort to respect their peers.</p><p>In one form or another, most students have experienced sexual or gender-based harassment. According to the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, 82 percent of surveyed LGBTQ+ students had previous bullying problems in school due to their sexuality in 2007. In 2010 to 2011, the American Association of University found that nearly half of surveyed students in grades seven to 12 had experienced sexual harassment. Additionally, the New York Daily News reported a 10 percent increase in 2016 to 2017 in bullying reports of students grades six to 12.</p><p>Schools should be able to address these issues with their student bodies, but it would be harder to understand harassment and make change if gender equality had not been previously and openly discussed. For example, some schools recommend guidance counselors to students who have experienced bullying. However, to spark a lasting change, schools should seek to stop the bullying from happening in the first place, rather than just comfort victims. With gender studies in school curriculums, students can become more aware of the parts that discrimination, sexism and racism play in everyday life and what can be done to decrease bullying from happening.</p><p>Stuyvesant High School should consider adding gender studies to its curriculum for freshmen. Gender studies is a crucial way of nurturing students, not only academically, but also personally. Not only should schools seek to prepare us for our future through core subjects, but also through the social necessities that impact the way we perceive our peers.</p><p>Schools have already begun to take action. In 2013, gender studies was introduced to the high school curriculum of Ontario, Canada. After taking note of prevalent sexual assault in the Toronto School District, five university students formed the Miss G Project and worked to have these important issues discussed in school. Josh Shier, a former student in one of Ontario’s high schools, remembers how this class improved his high school experience. “I was gay, dealing with a lot of bullying, and I had suicidal thoughts. Taking that course made me feel a little bit better about being different,” he said. “I feel like it was the only high school class I ever really learned anything in.”</p><p>Incorporating gender studies into high school will not drop harassment rates to zero percent. Yet depriving students of learning about social inequalities does nothing to help current harassment issues. Instead, this deprivation only perpetuates the idea that the problems we face among our peers in school are inevitable. This class is not a miracle cure, but it is a big step in the right direction of the society we want: a society where students are aware of the history behind issues that impact them daily. Schools have the responsibility to generate and uphold environments where students of any race, gender, and sexuality can feel safe.</p>	Article	290	2017-12-21 17:48:07.981268	2017-12-21 17:48:07.981268
689	Conference Days are Back at Stuyvesant Conference days are being held once a month for teachers and administrative staff to engage in professional development. <p>Conference days will be held on Mondays for teachers and administrative staff to engage in professional development starting on October 2. The conference day schedule includes periods that are four minutes shorter, with classes ending at 2:46 p.m. to make time for the meeting.</p><p>These days will allow teachers and assistant principals of different departments to meet for 40 minutes to discussing topics related to their content area, such as how to teach a specific unit, or how to get resources for a certain lab. The assistant principal will lead the conference, but the role can be transferred to teachers want to share something with rest of the department.</p><p>It is mandatory for the teachers to attend the conference days, and they won’t be getting additional hours or paid. “[Conference days] are part of the contract [...] which allows the school to administer it a maximum of twice a month,” Principal Eric Contreras said.</p><p>Teachers will also meet in smaller groups twice a month. “We are also keeping two Mondays for when teachers will come together in smaller pockets throughout the day for administrational and instructional sharing [throughout] departments,” Contreras said.</p><p>Former principal Stanley Teitel instituted conference days, as well. However, former principal Jie Zhang discontinued them.</p><p>Several teachers have expressed their approval of conference days to Contreras. “I am totally relieved and appreciative [about conference days]. It's been frustrating to have only a couple of non-school days when my whole department comes together,” Assistant Principal of English Eric Grossman said. “It's really valuable for us to set around the table together and talk as a department. Meeting in much smaller groups as we have done for the past few years, while there is some value in that, what it means is that it's much harder for everybody to hear from everybody else, work on things together, and agree on things together.”</p><p>Contreras hopes that bringing back conference days will push Stuyvesant forward. “We need to have conversations and listen to each other at all levels, but I do believe in modeling the work so if we want things to be innovative and collaborative at a student level, than we must do it at the adult level,” he said.</p>	Article	30	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
690	﻿Free School Available for All NYC Public School Students Free lunch available at Stuyvesant from a student’s perspective <p>School lunch is now free for all New York City public school students. The policy, Free Lunch for All, was announced by Chancellor Carmen Farina on September 6.</p><p>Historically, free lunch was provided for 75 percent of public school students based on family income. The purpose of the new policy is to eliminate the stigma against students who receive free lunch.</p><p>Lunch previously cost $2.25 for students who had to pay full price. However, Free Lunch for All is not expected to cost New York City more. Due to changes in how the city collects data on needy families, the city recently qualified for a federal program that will compensate for Free Lunch for All.</p><p>Though this change means each family’s income is irrelevant to qualify for free or reduced lunch, it is still important for families to complete the School Meals Form distributed to students during homeroom. The income data from these forms is needed in order to appropriately distribute funding as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provides financial assistance to schools with high percentages of low-income students, such as Stuyvesant.</p><p>Some believe the policy will not have a large effect on Stuyvesant. In a survey distributed online by The Spectator, 32.3 percent of respondents (151 students) answered that the new policy would have no effect on them. “I don’t really care about whether school lunch is free or not. I eat lunch outside anyway,” junior Francis Park said.</p><p>However, 33.1 percent of respondents (155 students) expect to eat school lunch more regularly, and 34.4 percent of respondents (161 students) already eat school lunch frequently.</p><p>Principal Eric Contreras views the change positively. “When students come to Stuy[vesant], I want their main focus to be on their academics and their success in and out of the classroom,” Contreras said. “Having a healthy nutritious lunch is an important thing for all students, and at Stuyvesant, for students to spend sometimes 10 hours every day here, making sure that they're not hungry while they’re in class or in club [meetings] or [during] sports team [practices] is really key for me.”</p>	Article	31	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
691	﻿Undocumented at Stuyvesant Stuyvesant has long been known to have an exceptionally large immigrant student population. A recent survey done by the Spectator revealed that approximately 74 percent of the current freshman class is either an immigrant or a child of immigrants. This makes our current political climate particularly sensitive for Stuyvesant students, especially in light of all of the rhetoric against immigration by the Trump administration. Unfortunately, this negative attention has silenced many students. The truth is that an issue that affects one student in our school affects us all. <p>Stuyvesant has long been known to have an exceptionally large immigrant student population. A recent survey done by the Spectator revealed that approximately 74 percent of the current freshman class is either an immigrant or a child of immigrants. This makes our current political climate particularly sensitive for Stuyvesant students, especially in light of all of the rhetoric against immigration by the Trump administration. Unfortunately, this negative attention has silenced many students. The truth is that an issue that affects one student in our school affects us all.</p><p>What is DACA and who are the DREAMers?</p><p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is an American immigration policy proposed by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It is designed to help immigrant children who arrived in the United States illegally by protecting them from deportation and providing a work permit for two years. In order to qualify for DACA, immigrants must have entered the U.S. before their sixteenth birthday and lived here since, be a student or high school graduate, and remain in good legal standing. DACA does not provide an opportunity for citizenship or any sort of federal funding/welfare.</p><p>As of 2017, around 800,000 immigrants are protected by the program. These immigrants are also known as DREAMers, named after the DREAM Act bill first introduced in the Senate in 2001. This Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act was a proposal for a process that would grant immigrant minors conditional residency in the U.S. for six years. Following graduation from an institution of higher education or service in the military, and a demonstration of good moral character, immigrants would be able to apply for permanent residency. Though this bill was estimated to benefit over two million immigrants, it failed to pass in the Senate. Immigrants under DACA (which was passed, in part, as a response of the failure of the DREAM act) were coined DREAMers.</p><p>Why is DACA so controversial?</p><p>Those who oppose DACA claim that allowing immigrants with a deferred status to stay would transfer valuable resources, time, and money away from legal residents. This includes services such as health care, education, and even printing driver’s licenses. However, this concern turns out to be unfounded. By purchasing cars and homes and starting their own businesses, DACA recipients end up pouring revenue back into the states. On another note, many Republican leaders see the DACA program as Obama overstepping his executive power, since the policy did not go through Congress.</p><p>What does Trump have to do with DACA?</p><p>Following an extreme anti-immigration stance during his campaign and pressure from Republicans to rescind DACA, President Trump ended the program at the beginning of the month. No new applications are being accepted, and those who are currently under protection risk deportation starting March 2018. Trump did, however, pass off the responsibility of protecting the DREAMers off to Congress, tweeting, “Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!” This provides hope that legislation will be able to recover some of these protections.</p><p>What rights do undocumented immigrants have?</p><p>Undocumented immigrants are entitled to the same basic Constitutional rights as citizens. However, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver’s licenses in most states, nor can they vote or receive financial aid for college.</p><p>But all immigrants — documented are not — are entitled to be treated the same as citizens in our country are. They deserve our respect, kindness, and sympathy. Though as high school students, it is not in our power to pass legislation that will soften the stigma against these people, we should take it upon ourselves to speak out against misinformed stereotypes and treat all people with empathy and respect.</p><p>Interview</p><p>To humanize Stuyvesant’s undocumented community, we sent out a form to solicit anonymous interviews. This was the only response we received, which speaks to the precariousness of these students’ situation.</p><p>What is your current immigration status?</p><p>My parents came as foreign students and we got the [...] visa for it and if my parents get the visa then their children get the visa automatically. The visa got expired because my parents couldn’t afford to go to school and that’s why we’re currently undocumented.</p><p>Are you currently under DACA?</p><p>I came to America in 2011, so I’m not qualified for DACA.</p><p>Did you always know your status?</p><p>Yeah. Mostly because my parents cannot speak English that well, and I was the one who had to translate all the documents for them. Also, I’m the oldest person among the siblings and I have to take care of everything.</p><p>Why did you come to the U.S.?</p><p>The direct reason we came to America was because my dad was having a business and it didn’t go well and [he] was seeking new opportunity in a new land. In the long term, it would be for our education (for me and my siblings)...Since I’m undocumented now I don’t know if it that will happen.</p><p>What was your personal experience adjusting to the US?</p><p>I was really nervous on the first day of school. I did not understand half of the words my teacher and friends were saying. I went to a school in [another state] first and my friends there were really nice and were really friendly to me and were trying to get me to adjust to a new way of life. But then I moved to a new town and had to go to a new school, which was a lot harsher for me because people there were less friendly. There were a lot of times I would stay by myself during lunch. It was kind of hard…  I moved to New York after one year in [another state]. I still remember the last day of school before moving to new York – I was on the school bus and there was this girl who was sitting in the back and … she yelled “I'm glad she's going” and I was sad.</p><p>How does the current political situation concerning immigration affect you?</p><p>DACA was the one way I could get a job and travel outside of America. If DACA still existed, they could have updated the year when you could come. Right now, you could get DACA only if you immigrated before 2008.</p><p>What is your opinion on the removal of DACA and the current political situation?</p><p>As the undocumented, we pay close attention to news about immigration and law changes, and  I was paying attention to election day. I personally didn’t believe Trump would be president, and  it was kind of like the end of the world I guess. I mean, that’s why I believe if Clinton became president it could have been better for us, even I could eventually gain citizenship I could at least hope of getting DACA and there is no hope for me right now to live in America. I’m trying to go to college but there's no way for me to afford it unless I become a citizen or at least a permanent resident. So that’s what I'm stressed about right now.</p><p>How do you feel at Stuyvesant as an undocumented immigrant?</p><p>It’s more diverse and more accepting. And I bet most people at Stuy don't like Trump. But I feel like there’s still a subtle tension that if I confront that I’m undocumented they would see me differently. This actually happened two days ago… Something came up and most of my friends knew I didn't get my citizenship yet and one of my friends actually asked, are you undocumented? And I guess I lied that I have green card and that wasn’t the first time I was asked that question and that’s usually how I get through those questions. Some of my closest friends knew I was undocumented but they didn’t really see me differently and they said they would try to help but I don’t know how they could help me… I talked to my guidance counselor about it and she was really accepting and she showed me a way: there’s a thing call BOLS – it’s volunteers of legal service, they provide lawyers to consult with undocumented people of how they can find a way to get out of their status. And my guidance counselor was really helpful and I actually went to the office and I met one of the lawyers and we talked about it and she was trying to help me but she said there's no way we can help you at this moment because of the laws and the status that I'm in.The biggest concern I have right now is trying to get to college. Undocumented people cannot have FAFSA or financial aid so that's why I have to talk to my Guidance Counselor more and with my College Counselor more.</p><p>Final statements</p><p>I just want to say that it can be anyone: your neighbors, the cashier you meet in your grocery store... To the undocumented people I want to say that I felt like I  was alone, that our family was the only one that was struggling with this problem, [but] now that a lot of people are standing up because of the extermination of DACA I have more hope for it and hopefully I can gain my way through college and eventually [get] a job and [settle] better in America because that's the whole reason I came to America.</p><p>Resources for Undocumented Students</p><p>https://www.ilrc.org/living-united-states-guide-immigrant-youth</p><p>https://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/focus/immigration-resources.html</p><p>For college applicants: http://www.onlinecolleges.net/for-students/undocumented-student-college-guide/</p><p>Undocumented Youth Led Organization in NYC:https://www.nysylc.org/what-we-do/</p><p>Resources: https://www.nysylc.org/college-info/</p><p>[a]</p><p>[a]This can be moved online.

692	﻿NYC Food Hall of Fame Chelsea Market opened its doors to thousands of hungry New Yorkers of wildly different backgrounds and tastes in food in 1980. Thus began a new... <p>Chelsea Market opened its doors to thousands of hungry New Yorkers of wildly different backgrounds and tastes in food in 1980. Thus began a new genre of city eateries: the food hall.</p><p>Food halls in NYC first existed as jumbled masses of stalls and people but have since transformed into carefully curated groups of restaurants chosen for quality and authenticity. These food halls have become more and more popular, with over 20 in NYC alone and five more set to open by 2018.</p><p>They have opened in train stations and warehouses to feed tens of thousands of visitors a day. These large spaces packed with stalls of a diverse array of cuisine allow people to get a taste of the world within the confines of their city. Food halls represent what is truly great about this city—the diverse range of cultures that thrive in our five boroughs—and allow us to share and appreciate these cultures.</p><p>Chelsea Market</p><p>Chelsea Market resembles an abandoned building fallen into disrepair, but in a way that seems very intentional—it features exposed brick and pipes, chipping paint, and graffiti-like wall art. There’s even a water fountain designed to look like a leak from an exposed pipe.</p><p>This market was a pioneer for food halls in the city and is now a NYC classic, frequented by tourists and residents alike. Every turn of the head brings a new restaurant or shop with its own aesthetic to your attention.</p><p>The range of food options is incredible—almost overwhelming—with each possible choice better than the last. From the chewy noodles served in simmering broth at Very Fresh Noodles to mini donuts with strange combinations of flavors that somehow mesh together in the perfect way at Doughnuttery, Chelsea Market is the one food hall that will truly never disappoint, no matter what you’re craving.</p><p>Try: Pollo asado tacos ($3.50 each) & horchata ($3.75) at Los Tacos No. 1</p><p>The Plaza Food Hall</p><p>Tucked inside the famous Plaza Hotel, with its reputation for luxury and glamour, the Plaza Food Hall yields high expectations but falls short on delivery. Upon entry, the atmosphere is stilted, and the décor comes across as tacky and overdone. In terms of food, there isn’t much variety—many of the stalls are bakeries. Some notable examples are Lady M, featuring its signature crêpe cakes layered with cream, and FP Patisserie, serving a variety of cakes and pastries.</p><p>However, the options for savory food are sparse. Two popular shops, No. 7 Sub and Chi Dumpling & Noodle, dish out mediocre food at unfair prices. Though some stalls do serve fresh and high-quality food, the majority of food at the Plaza is disproportionately expensive and can leave the entire hall feeling like an overpriced tourist trap. Ultimately, it is up to consumers to decide if they can afford the hit to their wallets.</p><p>Try: Green tea crepe cake ($9.00) at Lady M & Clam chowder ($6.50) at Luke’s Crab Shack</p><p>Canal Street Market</p><p>For those craving Asian food, look no further than Canal Street Market, one of the newest players in the NYC food hall game. The décor is modern and clean, and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed, a minimalistic contrast to other food halls.</p><p>As far as food goes, there aren’t as many choices as some other food halls offer, but of the food selection, there is a good variety of traditional and more modern, trendy dishes for an affordable price.</p><p>Buy a bento box from Izakaya Samurice for a filling entree or grab a quick bite from the dim sum stand Nom Wah Kuai. There’s even bubble tea, courtesy of The Boba Guys, if you’re looking for a sweet, refreshing respite from the heat. This hall is a great spot to sit and relax with friends without breaking the bank.</p><p>Try: Japanese curry rice ($10.00) at Izakaya Samurice & anything from Nom Wah Kuai ($5.00)</p><p>Industry City Food Hall</p><p>Located in an inconspicuous Brooklyn neighborhood, Industry City has a luxury that many Manhattan food halls don’t: space. Each vendor at Industry City has its own enclosed area with sitting space, rather than the classic small stalls that most food halls employ. It also has a nice outdoor space, with ample room to eat and relax, and even occasional live music events.</p><p>While the atmosphere of the hall is pleasant, the food itself leaves something to be desired. There isn’t much of a standout restaurant—food at the iconic Avocaderia, the world’s first avocado bar, is better to take pictures of than actually eat. Though some places have decent food, such as Ends Meat, a cured meat and sandwich shop, or One Girl Cookies, a small bakery and cafe, there really isn’t much at Industry City to draw customers out of their way to Sunset Park.</p><p>Try: Whoopie pie ($3.00) at One Girl Cookies</p><p>Urbanspace Vanderbilt</p><p>Upon entry to Urbanspace Vanderbilt, customers are greeted with a lively scene—the hustle and bustle of businesspeople in the heart of Manhattan. Vendors and customers alike are packed together into an almost overflowing space, without enough seating to accommodate everyone.</p><p>However, these crowds don’t detract from the food, which is the real star of the show. This food hall features a variety of cuisines, including everything from sizzling tacos at La Palapa to authentic pad thai at Bangkok B.A.R. Portions are hearty, and prices are reasonable—just the right combination for a great lunch spot.</p><p>Try: Famous original pizza ($10.00) at Roberta’s & Strawberry yuzu ($4.00) at Korilla</p><p>Considering the fact that they cater to such a diverse range of tastes, it’s no surprise that food halls are on the rise in New York City, with many more set to open in the near future. New halls like The North End, coming to Washington Heights in 2018, or Bourdain Market, set to open in the Meatpacking District in 2019, are sure to continue to spur this trend into the future.</p>	Article	41	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
693	﻿Visions of Americana Driving around my dad’s hometown in upstate New York showed me that our perceptions of small town America are wrong, and that they in fact represent a more diverse America than we give them credit for. <p>As New Yorkers, we tend to think of our country as two worlds: city and country, diverse and homogenous, progressive and conservative. This perspective dominates how we perceive small towns across the country, stereotyping them as everything urban life is not. With the election of Donald Trump, this division could not have been more overstated: urban areas voted one way, and the rest of the country voted the other. And yet, when I took a trip to visit upstate New York, where my dad grew up, I saw past my own stereotypes and witnessed the evolution of rural America.</p><p>We drove around winding roads dotted with houses as my dad recounted stories from his upbringing with each familiar landmark. We passed by the ice cream shop—a staple of Americana— whose sign read “Best Ice Cream in the U.S.A!” But to my dad, who grew up in a town filled with people who looked like him and sounded like him, what shocked him were the signs of growing diversity.</p><p>Interspersed with the houses that draped American flags on their front porches were houses with Puerto Rican, Dominican Republic, and Mexican flags. We passed “Blue Lives Matter” signs and front lawns bearing “I’m With Her” posters in the same instant. What we witnessed was not the old small town of yesterday, the one my father grew up in, but instead the changing face of America.</p><p>Rural America has seen the largest growth of minority populations in the United States, surpassing the growth of these populations in America’s urban centers. A 2012 National Library of Medicine report found that Hispanic populations in rural America represented 56 percent of its population growth from 2000 to 2010, and towns across America are quickly becoming more and more diverse.</p><p>A question is then raised: if suburban and rural America is becoming more diverse, why did it overwhelmingly vote for Trump? It is important to understand that while an area may become more diverse, not everyone living there is accepting of the changing status quo. A Pew Research poll found that only 20 percent of conservatives prefer to live in areas of mixed cultural diversity, meaning rural and suburban conservatives often vote for candidates who promise to restore the America of yesteryear: one that’s homogenous and less subject to change.</p><p>As we were driving, my dad and I stopped at a textile mill with a smokestack that had dominated the skyline of his town since before the Civil War. When we went inside, we found the entire factory—which had once been a staple of blue-collar jobs—had been converted into a brewery and arts center.</p><p>In her NPR article, “Leaving Urban Areas For The Political Homogeneity Of Rural Towns,” Mary Lou Reed of Kootenai County, Idaho, discusses the changing workplace of her town, noting, "The lumber mills are all gone, the mines are shuttered down, we do not have labor unions that are active.” Instead, small town Americans are embracing new businesses and enterprises across the United States. When considering this, that industrial factory-turned-brewery makes sense, and it is one small piece of a puzzle depicting a changing country.</p><p>The election of Donald Trump only heightened the perceived differences between city and rural populations. On a map of voters by county, cities in blue are swallowed up in vast expanses of rural red, as Trump won 3,084 of America's 3,141 counties. Hillary Clinton won just 57. Post-election coverage typecast the “angry white voter” who saw a changing country and voted against it as the catalyst for Trump’s victory.</p><p>This introduces another angle, one where rural Americans were pushed by our condescending urban stereotypes—describing non-urbanites as uneducated and irrational—to endorse a candidate such as Trump. A recent Salon article proves that urban intellectuals hold these stereotypes, reading, “In the ‘real America,’ people don’t read The New York Times at all. One who rejects the pursuit of knowledge will not place much emphasis on intellectual rigor when voting for president.”</p><p>Our visions of Americana tend to focus on small towns with white picket fences, local ice cream shops, and main street Fourth of July celebrations. Yet, the country is changing; towns are becoming more diverse and less reliant on industrial jobs. If we want the last election to not repeat itself, we need to embrace a changing America instead of continuing to push other Americans away.</p>	Article	35	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
1006	﻿Death of a Senior  <p>Autopsy Report</p><p><h5>Description:</h5></p><p>A body was found under a stack of papers on December 31, 2017.</p><p><h5>External Examination:</h5></p><p>The body is that of a male in his young adulthood. It is suspected that the deceased is a senior at Stuyvesant High School. The body weighs 153 pounds, measuring 71 inches from crown to sole. The residual hair on scalp is black with spots missing from sides. It seems like the decedent’s hair was torn out. The skin of the body exhibits wrinkles characteristic of someone in his late 30s during a midlife crisis. Deceased’s nose is abnormally flattened. Further analysis indicates this is not due to blunt trauma but due to prolonged sleeping on a flat surface, like a textbook. Eyes could not be analyzed due to excessive swelling of eye bags.</p><p><h5>Clothing:</h5></p><p>The deceased is wearing a faux Supreme Box Logo. The printed text reads, “Stuylin’.” Blood has stained the box logo to a darker shade of red. Multiple coffee stains can be found on the deceased’s clothing. Examination of the pristine Adidas Yeezy Boost shoes reveals that the deceased most likely tried to safeguard his shoes.</p><p><h5>Description of Injury:</h5></p><p>The wounds are located on the left side of the chest, 14 inches below the top of the head and three inches from the side of the body. The wounds are deep cuts created by a smooth edge. The wounds measure a tenth of an inch deep. This corresponds with the length and shape of the college brochures found at the crime scene.</p><p>The deceased also exhibits bruising and broken ribs. At the crime scene, the victim was found buried beneath piles of A4 copy paper. Many of these sheets had titles like “Why I Love Your University.”</p><p><h5>Conclusion</h5></p><p>This is a fatal wound associated with excessive bleeding as a result of multiple cut wounds. It also seems that the deceased suffered from crushed ribs before death. It is likely that he was flipping through too many college brochures in a sleep-deprived state. He accidentally cut himself with the papers and was buried by his college applications, unable to call for help.</p>	Article	404	2018-01-23 02:51:01.47185	2018-01-23 02:51:01.47185
907	﻿“Humans of New York: The Series” Brandon Stanton’s “Humans of New York: The Series” Facebook show is beautiful, but relatively uninteresting—we could have expected more from filmed work. <p>When you watch Brandon Stanton’s “Humans of New York: The Series” for a minute, the most normal of people become as interesting to you as they are to themselves.</p><p>The most iconic of all of Stanton’s work as we know it are the Facebook and Instagram posts of grandfathers who have lived many lives, four-year-old microfashionistas clad in vivid colors, driven entrepreneurs, and teenage subway performers whose art is their living. In the HONY Series, these characters are reincarnated in film with their raspy, timid, or boisterous voices and idiosyncrasies in movement, allowing another layer of personality to transcend the limitations of a computer screen.</p><p>“HONY: The Series” continues the intimate features of outstanding and average, thoughtful people. One episode of Stanton’s newest venture features a guitarist who shares his darkest fear of “getting too old to be appreciated” and then plays a song. It makes us realize that we hide this same fear while a newfound appreciation of this musician blooms within us: we don't want him to ever be or feel too old.</p><p>A preteen remarks, “You’re gonna outgrow everything, eventually. You’re just gonna lose everything. I just don’t wanna let go,” and makes us nostalgic for everything we've outgrown or if we're young, everything we will soon outgrow.</p><p>An old lady draped in pink, sitting on her stoop, refuses to disclose anything about her life and adds with sass, “If I made a movie of my life, I would win 500 awards. Not 100, 500.”</p><p>If these people were captured in photographs, we would not hear the first man's guitar, the meditation in the kid's voice as he contemplates the right wording, or the distinctive attitude of the woman.</p><p>Stanton establishes throughout that all people are artists in their own right, be it through their words, their profession, their dress, or some recounted creative endeavor from decades past. The Series reestablishes this, while further humanizing subjects through the recordings.</p><p>Stanton's experimentation with new content and medium is nothing new—he periodically undertakes new endeavors to spice up his work. In the past, he expanded beyond New York City and traveled to 20 diverse countries, such as India, Iraq, Ukraine, and Uganda. He has also compiled his many encounters into New York Times bestselling books.</p><p>With millions of supporters already following his page—hundreds, if not thousands, from our very own Stuyvesant High School—the Series has a high bar to meet. In going to another country, the different cultures and people were new and interesting, but his role as an interviewer remained the same. In his book, the medium was still essentially photography, so it made sense to see similar content and formatting to what we do on a computer screen. Venturing into film, however, demanded something more.</p><p>“HONY: The Series” should be something more raw and distinctive in its representation of New Yorkers than HONY photography. So much can be done with film as a medium. It offers the power of a more complete story—it ties together different people, different ends. It can have a more compelling and apparent plot than any photograph or caption, and it allows for more character development. The Series, however, doesn’t fully realize film’s potential to tell cohesive, overarching stories, and is, instead, closer to being an extension of the photographic medium.</p><p>Each episode of the Series is based on a theme overflowing with human relevance: help, stardom, parenting, time, or home. Every story has a strong connection to this one-word theme. The episode “Help” features a businessman learning to do the little deeds he could for people. Another explores the enrichment of the life of an elderly man paired with a volunteer by a Nazi victims organization through their shared love of dance. The final example is of a man whose dog has always been there for him, and of whom he is ready to let go.</p><p>Though these topics are relevant, the individual stories within each episode, while all addressing the same themes, are insufficiently linked to one another. It’s like a patchwork quilt where everything is the same material, but the designs don’t complement one another. Stanton initially succeeds in intriguing us with a short profound segment, a metaphor, or an oddity. Some of the appeal, however, dies by the end of the 15-minute long segments. We need a reason to watch 15 minutes of a continuous clip, rather than the shorter videoclips plastered on social media.</p><p>Many of the episodes are still powerful. “Help,” for example, is one of my favorites, but more for the fact that each individual story is affective, rather than the video’s overall cohesion. The lack of a plot, or some other clear intrigue, is likely a reason that the views on these episodes on Facebook have fallen from seven to eight million views on early videos to half the amount on later videos. The episodes can be very meaningful, and watching them should feel less tedious.</p><p>Though the content may lack excitement, the cinematography of the HONY Series is beautiful, combining profiles and direct views of speakers’ faces with time lapses of crowds passing over subway staircases, of the NYC skyline at dusk through night, or of the scintillating lights of Times Square, overlaid with R&B beats.</p><p>“Humans of New York: The Series” is a beautiful piece of artwork. We find bolder personality by not only reading, but hearing voices. Nonetheless, it could capitalize more on the use of film as a medium and on the continuity of a lengthy video to create something as beautiful and more captivating. If HONY is going to be something new, why not embrace its newness?</p>	Article	305	2017-12-21 22:14:57.239681	2017-12-21 22:14:57.239681
918	﻿Runnin’ Rebels Open Season With Nail-Biter  <p>Every fan in the bleachers, every coach and player on the bench and on the court swiveled their heads in unison as the ball arched toward the basket; no one had as much anticipation, however, as senior Nicholas Kim, whose arm was still suspended in the air as his wrist flicked. The entire gym followed the ball as it bounced off the back of the rim and onto the court below. Just missing that final shot, the Runnin’ Rebels, Stuyvesant’s boys’ basketball team, were defeated in a nail-biter in their season opener against the Hunter College High School Eagles. The final score was 42-41.</p><p>It was a back-and-forth game, with the Rebels surging to an early lead but getting blown out in the second quarter 18-7. Despite winning the last two quarters and going on a late run, the team fell just short of a comeback. The Rebels struggled with unforced turnovers throughout the game, according to both senior Nicola Manfredi and Kim. “There wasn’t a lot of flow in the game,” Manfredi said. “There was a lot of subbing, so no one could really get into the gist of the game.” Despite three relatively stagnant quarters to start the contest, the Rebels seemed to finally gain some momentum late in the fourth quarter. The run was sparked by a three-pointer from Kim, followed by several stops on the defensive side of the ball. In wake of the heartbreaking loss, the Rebels have managed to extract some positives. “We moved the ball around well; we took good shots. I thought our defense was very good as well. We only held them to 42 points,” Manfredi said.</p><p>In addition to this league opener against the Eagles, the Rebels have played three non-league games, winning one of the three. They faced Leon M. Goldstein High School for Science and Jacqueline K. Onassis Intel Careers in a Thanksgiving tournament at Millennium High School, falling 46-64 and prevailing 59-55, respectively. Finally, they were ousted by Martin L. King Jr. 23-48 soon before the regular season opener. Junior Richard Zheng emerged as a scoring threat in these games, which meant good news for the future of Stuyvesant basketball.</p><p>In league play, the Rebels have struggled thus far. They currently sit at the bottom of their division with an 0-3 record. After the home opener, they dropped two straight against the Eleanor Roosevelt High School Huskies and the East Harlem Pride. The scores were 47-57 and 52-64, respectively. However, the team showed signs of progress in the East Harlem game as senior Michael Gillow joined Kim and Manfredi in double-digit point scoring.</p><p>The Rebels have set their goals high; as both Kim and Manfredi said, their ultimate goal is “to make playoffs.” However, they have kept themselves grounded. “For now, we just want to win one game at a time,” Kim said. Their most conspicuous issues thus far have been turnovers and a lack of flow. Nonetheless, the team is optimistic and attributes much of its struggles to getting used to a new system with first-year coach, guidance counselor Paul Goldsman, and the new players on the team getting used to playing at the fast-paced varsity level. “With a new coach, the returners had to adapt to a new play-style, and the rookies have to experience playing basketball on the varsity level. Moving forward, I know that we'll start to grow together and learn how to play with one another,” Kim said.</p><p>Clearly, the entire team is on the same page. “Since half the varsity team is new, my goal is to get the players acclimated with each other. I often switch lineups (both in games and in practice) to help ensure that different players learn multiple positions, as well as how to play the game with different people,” Goldsman said. While citing the same weaknesses as his players, Goldsman also gave his coach’s insight into the things this year’s squad has going for it. He said, “Players are always willing to make the extra pass and find the open man. Nobody dominates the ball and everyone is always involved in our offense. I think this can be attributed to our players wanting to make each other better, while also ensuring that everyone feels like a member of the team.” Also, “the players, especially our seniors, have been guiding the other players and giving them instruction and encouragement. They provide guidance on running certain plays and make keen observations during the game,” Goldsman said.</p><p>As they continue to adjust and work out the kinks in their new system, the Rebels anticipate the season, which will be going into full throttle shortly, with optimism. “I know that our coach knows what he's doing and our players have a passion to win, so hopefully, the pieces will start falling into place,” Kim said. Led by Kim and Manfredi, the team will look to build off the positives against Hunter to remain competitive in the Manhattan A1 division. “I know that as we continue to learn the plays and build up confidence, we will score more points, which will result in some victories,” Goldsman said.</p>	Article	316	2017-12-21 23:02:26.757739	2017-12-21 23:02:26.757739
920	﻿Spartans Showing Flashes in a Hard Fought Season Opener The Stuyvesant wrestling team showed a lot of potential in their season opener against Edward R. Murrow High School which took place on December 5th. <p>“How strong? Stuy strong!” the Spartans shouted before starting their season on December 5 against Edward R. Murrow High School. The team fell 42-47 in the season opener, but there were many positive takeaways. “I saw some good wrestling from these beginners. This is an early tourney in the season, so obviously, I saw some mistakes as well. Me and the other captain, [senior] Adam Abbas, helped these guys grow as wrestlers, so it was real nice to see them perform well,” senior and co-captain Allard Peng said. Though senior Danil Chernov and junior Rubin Peci both joined this season, both came away with victories in the match. They will play big roles this season as the team tries to rise up in its Region 5 division.</p><p>Despite the many positives, Peng was disappointed with his own performance, saying, “I ended up taking third out of a bracket of six people. I feel like I didn't wrestle smart, and I didn't uphold my role as a role model.” These high standards will ideally translate into improvement as the season continues, as Peng’s drive for success will hopefully carry over to the team. Overall, this first match was a great starting point for the Spartans.</p><p>The team wants to bounce back from their 2-5 record from last year. They want to improve in hopes of getting to the playoffs. This will be tough without Cade Lueker (‘17), who finished second at the City Championships last year in the 170-pound weight class. In order to minimize the effect of his loss, Peng and Abbas are taking initiatives to train the younger people on the team. Specifically, “[We have] to stay focused and stick to the basics. In wrestling, what wins a match are the simple and practiced moves,” Abbas said. Repeating the same sets of moves over and over will drill them into the team, which will hopefully translate into in-game success.</p><p>Pushing each other both at practices and competitions can create the drive that can lead this team to where they want to be. A long-term goal, Peng said, “[is] to see Stuyvesant High School produce a State Champion.” It remains to be seen whether this season will produce one, but, one match in, the Spartans have their work cut out for them.</p>	Article	318	2017-12-21 23:03:52.497368	2017-12-21 23:03:52.497368
921	﻿Peglegs Looking to Capture Fourth Straight Title The Stuyvesant boys’ table tennis team, the Titans, are looking to capture their fourth straight title amid the loss of key players. <p>There has never been a dark spot in the history of Stuyvesant’s boys’ table tennis team, the Titans. Ever since table tennis became an official PSAL sport three years ago, in 2014, the boys’ table tennis team has dominated the city and captured all three championships.</p><p>During last year’s playoffs, first-seeded Stuyvesant faced its rival, Brooklyn Technical High School, and won the match 5-0. The team easily won each of its games 3-0 (in a best of five). Though the team has lost five seniors, including first and second singles Alston Wang and Eric Amstislavskiy, respectively, it still hopes to continue its golden streak. Current senior and co-captain Isaac Rose-Berman said, “We've never lost a game in [the last] four years and [we] want to keep that streak going, especially as this is [Dr. Feigenbaum’s] final year. We definitely want to make him proud and perform to the best of our ability.”</p><p>Many of last year’s players, along with a mixture of new players, have had to step into a larger role this year. Senior and co-captain Alvin Chen, who became first singles this year, said, “We are definitely going to have a much harder time without last year's seniors, but I believe if everyone does his part, we can win again.”</p><p>Currently, the team is in first place in the Central Division. In the past three games, the Titans have shut out Brooklyn Community Arts and Media (BCAM) High School, Millennium High School, and Jacqueline K. Onassis Inter Careers all by a score of 5-0, not losing a single game in the BCAM match. New starters this year include sophomore Jeremy Lee as first doubles and senior Mahidul Shahel with freshman Dilan Apterman as second doubles.</p><p>One notable thing is that while they are still winning, the Titans seem to be struggling more than they have in the past. In the previous game against Millennium High School, the third singles game played by Rose-Berman and the first doubles match, played by Lee and junior substitute Linpeng Chen, were won by 3-1, meaning they each dropped a game to their opponents. While they both handily won their matches, it could become a more pronounced problem against a tougher team.</p><p>That tougher team is also their main rival, Brooklyn Tech. “It’s an uphill battle for us. A few people have to improve to have a shot at [defeating] Brooklyn Tech,” coach Feigenbaum said. He made it clear that this season is going to be much tougher than those of previous years because of the loss of key players and the new freshmen that Brooklyn Tech has acquired. However, as of right now, the team appears to be as strong as ever.</p><p>Since this could be coach Feigenbaum’s last year, he has to prepare his players for a coaching change and find the new coach. He does not believe that the assistant coach will step into that role and has been “looking for people that…know the rules and the strategy and have the time to do the job.” While it is still early in the season, it is never too early to think about the future.</p><p>The Titans are gearing up for another championship run despite the loss of multiple seniors from last year. They have shown a few signs of weakness compared to last year, meaning everyone has to step and work a little harder. Many of the players have had a lot of experience with table tennis and been part of the championship teams led by Dr. Feigenbaum and will again aim for a fourth straight City Championship.</p>	Article	319	2017-12-21 23:04:24.866484	2017-12-21 23:04:24.866484
922	﻿What’s the Best or Weirdest Gift You Have Ever Received?  <p><h4>Jerry Citron (Science Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift I've ever gotten was a really high class terrain bike. It's a bike that allows you to ride long distances, and you use it to travel long distances. It was a long time ago. I think maybe my mother bought it for me.”</p><p><h4>Carlos Bravo (Spanish Teacher)</h4></p><p>“When I was about eight years old, my grandmother gave me a baked potato wrapped in tinfoil. I cried for two hours.”</p><p><h4>Kristyn Pluchino (Chemistry Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The weirdest gift I got from a student is makeup. I don't really wear much makeup, but they got me foundation. I've gotten a lot of other terrible gifts. In the ‘80s, my mom got me a little business suit, and I was a child with a blazer and gigantic shoulder pads.”</p><p><h4>Jason Econome (Biology Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift for me would have to be the birth of my son, a month before Christmas. George was eight pounds and quite beautiful. It was a great way to bring in the Christmas holiday. and it couldn’t be any better than that. The worst gift is probably clothing. I was a hyperactive kid; all I had on my mind was sports and music. I was actually thinking I was going to get a bicycle; I just needed one badly. Instead I got clothing: a pair of pants and a couple of shirts; what a disappointment!"</p><p><h4>Charles Kuang (Computer Science Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The weirdest gift I ever received was from this student I taught in middle school, but also teach now. She gave me a dictionary because I misspelled the word ‘class’ on the board like one time.”</p><p><h4>Marianne Prabhu (Biology Teacher)</h4></p><p>“That's tough, because for the most part, people are pretty good gift-givers. My mom is an excellent gift-giver; she's always so thoughtful. But I would have to say, one of the worst gifts was that a guy I was dating got me a gift card to a teacher's store. I was like, 'This isn't something fun; that isn't a personal gift!'"</p><p><h4>Ernest Oliveri (Assistant Principal of the World Languages Department)</h4></p><p>“I think I got a weird kitchen utensil once. It was one of those multi-tool kitchen utensils that don't work very well. I've also given some pretty weird gifts; I gave my wife a weed-whacker—not the kind of gift you give a woman. When we bought a house, I couldn't touch the lawn mower—she wouldn't let me go near it. I thought to myself, ‘She has discovered her inner gardener; I'm going to get her something that she can use in the garden.’ So I got her a weed-whacker. To this day, she has not touched that weed-whacker. And she did not talk to me for about three days.”</p><p><h4>Katherine Kincaid (English Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift that I've ever received was when I had first met my husband, we had first started dating, so he did my birthday gifts as a scavenger hunt. He hid the presents all over my apartment, and each present had a clue to finding the next present, and they got slowly better. They were all different things that I wanted, like a book or a nice shirt, and some of them were more sentimental things. The present that I liked the most was a little card that said he would take me out shopping to buy whatever outfit of my choice in whatever store I wanted.”</p><p><h4>Madeline Horan (English Teacher)</h4></p><p>“I'd say the weirdest holiday gift came from my grandmother, a devout Catholic who went to mass every day, which showed in her Christmas presents—usually holy cards, rosary beads, and prayer books. When I was thirteen, she gave me a statue of the Virgin Mary wrapped up in newspaper. I unraveled it to find a painted face smiling at me, but then I lost sight of the eyes as the head rolled out of the newspaper. She told me, ‘I dropped it in the St. Scholastica parking lot.’ I wasn't sure whether we should put it on the mantle.”</p><p><h4>Eric Ferencz (English Teacher)</h4></p><p>"As a Jewish child in a Christian country, I came to learn Hanukkah exists amidst the deeply-cast shadow of Christmas. It's a completely unfair comparison. Christmas is a celebration of the birth of Christ, a seminal holiday. Hanukkah is a minor Jewish holiday; a celebration of a successful Maccabean revolution, an event that cannot be found in the pages of the Old Testament. Hanukkah is not our Christmas. Considering this disparity, Hanukkah's proximity to Christmas on the calendar, and the gross commercialization of holiday gift-giving, Hanukkah is unfairly presented as the Jewish counterpart of Christmas.</p><p>In my family, Hanukkah was a progressive holiday: over the course of eight days, the gifts became progressively worse. The first night was always reserved for the best presents; a copy of Contra for the NES [Nintendo Entertainment System], or a new CD player. But as the seventh or eighth night rolled around, and parental creativity waned, gifts became more utilitarian as I'd received objects that I simply expected my parents to purchase for me. One could imagine the disappointed look on an eight-year-old tearing eagerly through decorative wrapping paper only to discover tube socks? Pencils? A new toothbrush? And as Jewish holidays begin when the sun sets, the anticipation of that night's gifts paired with some unrealistic daydreaming could only lead to disappointment when unwrapping the gifts of night four or five or six or seven or eight.</p><p>I know that I'm speaking of a child of great privilege, but at the time, considering the fortunes I perceived my peers had bestowed upon them, I somehow felt jilted."</p><p><h4>Liliya Shamazov (Music Teacher)</h4></p><p>“Mrs. Hall and I got a card picture of both of us. The kids went out to Central Park where people paint you, but in a caricature style. They had this guy paint us based on our photographs, and they brought it in, and it was really adorable and funny.”</p><p><h4>Lee Brando (Social Studies Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift that I've ever received is not anything material. It would be having my family members around: the people that I love, the people that are close to me. I'm thankful for the birth of all my nieces and my nephew, that my family is healthy, and my friends are healthy as well. And for my health. And also my students. That's the best gift I can think of; everything else is ephemeral. We do have lives, but in terms of total fulfillment, it's people.”</p><p><h4>Rebecca Lindemulder (French and German Teacher)</h4></p><p>“The best gift I got was an iPhone a couple years ago, but it had hidden motives because my parents wanted me to stay in contact with them when I was away from them.”</p><p><h4>Maria Nedwidek-Moore (Biology Teacher)</h4></p><p>“I still have most gifts and cards I have ever received in my life, and Christmas is far and away my favorite holiday. Gift-giving is a precious thing, and I never want to forget when I am privileged to receive a gift from someone. I first thought of a Christmas gift from my parents that changed the way I think about the world. It was a small toy microscope, which I still have, and I was mesmerized, eventually pursuing biology as a career.</p><p>My father often took me to Tiffany's to look at the engagement rings when I got older. Eventually, I met my husband. Six months after the day I met him at my 25th Stuy reunion, he proposed. We went the next day for the ring, walking across Central Park to Tiffany's in the spring rain. I was excited to find something practical and pretty, and just what we could afford. We were married in August of 2014. That ring definitely qualifies as the best gift: something I wished for all my life, from the man I wished for all my life.”</p>	Article	320	2017-12-21 23:26:28.451863	2017-12-21 23:26:28.451863
923	﻿What Happens Online Doesn’t Stay Online  <p>This past year has seen an unprecedented number of cases of online harassment, cyberbullying, and intentional acts of hate in the Stuyvesant community. A group of freshman boys was found to have been ranking and commenting on their their female classmates’ appearances in a derogatory fashion. Screenshots of the messages, which were exchanged in a private group chat, were posted in the freshman Facebook group. The boys in question offered apologies only once they found the majority of the freshman class objected to their actions. Yet the issue did not and does not end there.</p><p>The effects of such a toxic conversation aren’t ended with a half-hearted apology. One of the girls they targeted cut class in order to avoid seeing them. The term “respecting women” has become the mocking mantra of a select group of students who believe what the boys did was an extension of their right to free speech. Arguments over Facebook have seeped into the daily lives of Stuyvesant students, adding a degree of undeniable severity. When incidents like this occur, students and the administration must take on certain responsibilities in order to address these issues effectively.</p><p><b>Responsibilities of Students</b></p><p>In the freshman Facebook group, being able to chime in on an issue online led to a massive influx of posts and hundreds of comments written by freshmen, chastising their peers. The comments began as condemnations of objectifying women and ended with personal attacks against the students in question. It got to the point where Student Union President Tahseen Chowdhury felt the need to block any new posts, writing, “All posts are moderated until the group is cleaned up and everyone learns their limits.”</p><p>There is a clear line between informing someone of inappropriate behavior online and constructively criticizing his or her actions. Students online must understand that name-calling and threatening someone for his or her beliefs is indistinguishable from harassment and cyberbullying. Once the provoking issue has been identified and the person approached and talked to maturely, students must learn to take a step back.</p><p>Students must also realize that everything they post online is their direct responsibility. Whether a message is posted in a public Facebook group or messaged in a private group chat, students run and must accept the risk of it being viewed by anyone. When other students have the opportunity to screenshot offensive or harmful posts, privacy and immunity from repercussions are not guaranteed, especially when these posts directly affect Stuyvesant students. In addition, witnessing cyberbullying warrants reporting it.</p><p>When incidents such as these occur, the first group to approach handling it should be the student body. This means expanding the role of Big Sibs and other upperclassmen to serve as unofficial mediators. Underclassmen who feel more comfortable talking to their fellow students instead of immediately going to their guidance counselors should be able to trust the upperclassmen, who in turn must be mature and responsible in handling it to their best of their abilities. When they feel the issue is a delicate one that requires adult intervention, Big Sibs must take the initiative to bring it up to the administration.</p><p><b>Responsibilities of the Administration</b></p><p>When a student has been targeted, the administration has the responsibility to offer the victim ways to cope with and resolve the event. The victim should be called to his or her guidance counselor’s office immediately after the administration hears of the incident. A guidance counselor should offer emotional support and ask to provide any services to the student, such as an appointment with the SPARK office. If the student would not like to discuss the event with an adult, the guidance counselor should not interrogate the student or force him or her to discuss the event. In this case, the guidance counselor can gently recommend the student talks to a Big Sib.</p><p>Further, the student who has been targeted should have a say in how the conflict between the harasser and the victim should be resolved. If the victim asks for it, he or she should have a chance to talk with the harasser and explain why these actions were hurtful. A guidance counselor should be present to mediate the conversation and make sure the situation does not escalate, but the counselor should not attempt to control the dialogue. Both students should be able to explain their sides of the conflict in a constructive way. The mediation session should end when the victim decides it should, and if the victim would like more than one session, their request should be granted.</p><p>We understand that students may not be able to appropriately rationalize their experiences with bullying and ask for help when they need it. However, guidance counselors must make sure that when a student does ask for their help, the situation is not taken out of that student’s hands. If a student only wants to talk about a traumatic event but would rather not attend a mediation session, guidance should not force him or her to discuss the event with the harasser.</p>	Article	321	2017-12-21 23:34:20.915928	2017-12-21 23:34:20.915928
694	﻿What It Means to Be Beautiful Summarize the focus of the story in one sentence <p>The Stereotype of Beauty</p><p>“With a smile and a song / life is just a bright sunny day / your cares fade away,” Snow White croons to some blue jays in the midst of a forest. Many recognize Snow White as a nostalgic representation of beauty, with her pale skin and delicate voice. The classic story of Snow White is that her stepmother is jealous of her youthful beauty. Her stepmother proceeds to brew a poisonous apple and tricks her into eating it, causing Snow White to fall into a coma. However, a prince, shocked by her beauty, falls in love with Snow White and kisses her, which subsequently revives her.</p><p>Most children hear this classical story at some point in their childhood, or at least read or watched an adaptation of the story. These children get the message that beauty is associated with being a damsel in distress and that a man must come and save her to be the hero. This idea of a “damsel in distress” has been used in many action movies, where female characters appear to only be the love interest of the male hero and are often saved by the male hero.</p><p>Another stereotype that I remember vividly was that to be beautiful, you had to be blonde, blue-eyed, pale-skinned, female, and thin. Most of the main actresses in movies fit these stereotypes. I recall staring up at my television screen, watching the Oscars with my parents and seeing the nominations for Best Actress; most of them were blonde and white. My young mind thought that I, as an Asian American with brown eyes and black hair, could never be as beautiful as them.</p><p>A New Direction</p><p>A controversy last year surrounded the Oscar nominees, as if in direct response to my dilemma. The problem was that all 20 of the Oscar nominees in the main four categories (best actress, best actor, best actress in a supporting role, and best actor in a supporting role) were white. Fire erupted on social media under the tag “#OscarsSoWhite,” and many activists and celebrities chose not to go to the Oscars in response to the controversy. This lack of diversity was noticeably absent in the most recent Oscars.</p><p>In recent times, the tides have shifted. Many companies and activists are stepping up to be more inclusive, provide more diverse role models for young children, and boost the self esteem of women.</p><p>Disney has been proactive with the issue, creating diverse princesses for their movies. I grew up looking up to Mulan. She was not only beautiful, with flowing black hair just like I have, but was also tough and persevering. Nowadays, we have an even more diverse cast of Disney princesses: Jasmine (1992), Mulan (1995), Pocahontas (1995), Tiana (2009), Merida (2012), and most recently, Moana (2016).</p><p>But Disney was not the only company that changed. After 57 years of controversy, Mattel, the creator of the famous (and infamous) Barbie doll, finally gave in to the diversifying meaning of “beauty” and gave her a makeover because she had been promoting the stereotypical blonde-hair, stick-thin ideal of beauty. Over the years, many girls have been affected by this unrealistic body image and have tried to change themselves to look more like the Barbie doll in order to be “beautiful.” Mattel introduced a new line of Barbie dolls with three different body types: tall, petite, and curvy, coming from many ethnic backgrounds and with different styles of hair.</p><p>The old stereotype of beauty is out, and a new, more diverse image has been introduced: “All women are beautiful, no matter what skin color or body type they have.”</p><p>Heading Forward</p><p>We’ve come far, but it doesn’t mean media representation of beauty is perfect. Models in fashion magazines are still predominantly unnaturally thin and tall, and this has led to body image issues for many young girls who want to be as beautiful as they are. A social media trend of having a “thigh gap” has become increasingly popular, despite many people not having a body type capable of having a thigh gap. Even with the increased representation of beautiful women from minority backgrounds, there is still a disproportionately high representation of white women as being beautiful.</p><p>A core problem with beauty and its representation in media is that LGBTQ+ people are severely underrepresented. I, myself, identify as LGBTQ+, so it really upset me that there was a lack of role models that helped me be comfortable with myself and my identity. For example, there are very few transgender role models for transgender children to look up to.</p><p>Also, I often felt left out when someone said that “all women are beautiful” because as a young boy, I always wanted to be graceful, elegant, and beautiful. As I grew up, I became uncomfortable with my body image because no one would tell me that even though I was a boy, I was beautiful too. Watching television, I would see countless advertisements for makeup companies, and I would never see any guys.</p><p>I would spend countless hours staring at the mirror with discomfort and dissatisfaction. Sometimes I would be overwhelmed by emotion, and my eyes would dampen. My body image issues (along with other identity problems at the time) eventually took a toll on my confidence and self esteem to the point where I was very shy around people I didn’t know very well or trust as a friend. Thankfully, I overcame my insecurities when I came to Stuyvesant, knowing that at least some people would accept me for who I am.</p><p>Because of this, I always hope that someday the saying “all women are beautiful” will eventually become “all people are beautiful.” I hope that all children, whether they are female, male, or non-binary, know that they are beautiful and that the societal standard of beauty is simply unrealistic.</p>	Article	44	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
695	﻿The Beauty Guru Fever A thinkpiece on the influence beauty gurus have on our culture and younger generations in particular. <p>We’ve all witnessed the foolishness; you’re scrolling down your Instagram feed one day, and you come across a video of someone applying his or her makeup with a hardboiled egg. Surprisingly, this is no longer an unfamiliar occurrence. In recent years, the number of so-called “beauty gurus” who have taken to social media platforms has proliferated.</p><p>Their influence seems to be as prominent as ever as young people around the world mimic trends in hair, makeup, and clothing, inspired by none other than beauty gurus. Though many of these trends may seem strange at first, they are soon devoured by the youth. It is evident that beauty influencers are transforming youth culture, one BeautyBlender at a time.</p><p>A beauty guru is a person who has a passion for some aspect of beauty, such as hair, nails, or most popularly, makeup. On social media platforms, especially YouTube and Instagram, gurus express their zeal for beauty by reviewing cosmetic products, creating hair, nail, and makeup tutorials, sharing their beauty tips and tricks, and most recently, creating challenge videos in which they race to complete their makeup in under a minute, apply a full face of children’s makeup, or complete other goofy tasks.</p><p>According to Media Life Magazine, their main demographic is women of ages 14-34, though it is not rare to find a male beauty junkie as well. 17-year-old, self-taught makeup artist James Charles became the first male spokesmodel for cosmetic brand Covergirl in 2016, setting a milestone in upsetting traditional gender roles. Bretman Rock, Jeffree Star, and Angel Merino are a few other well-known names in the community of makeup lovers.</p><p>According to YouGov polling firm, one-third of Americans are indifferent to males wearing makeup. This is a significant change from the stigma surrounding boys wearing makeup that we have seen in the past. Together, male beauty influencers help break down the barriers set by society, which discourage boys from dabbling in makeup.</p><p>In modern social media, beauty gurus are extremely prevalent on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, with the top beauty vloggers having an average of 2.1 million followers or subscribers, according to TubeFilter. Your own peers are most likely well-acquainted with at least one guru.</p><p>This popularity has allowed the impact of newly bred trends to skyrocket as we see young people explore intriguing style choices like feather brows and rainbow eyeliner. Kylie Jenner, a growing personality and trendsetter in the makeup industry, created a daring trend last August when she posed in an Instagram photo clad in jeans with rips on her butt.</p><p>At first, many were shocked and confused as to what the appeal of bare-butt jeans was. However, this style was soon adopted and appreciated by many young girls, which was not completely unexpected, considering Jenner’s colossal follower count. Some argue whether the enormous influence that Jenner wields is positively impacting the youth or simply inspiring mindless behavior, such as the popular “Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge,” in which teenagers used the suction from bottles or glasses to swell their lips and mimic Jenner’s famous pout.</p><p>Though this dangerous practice is an example of social influence gone awry, the positive aspects of Jenner’s immense influence outweigh the negatives. Though she isn’t exactly changing the world, she is setting an example for the youth in terms of appreciating one’s individuality and straying from the norm when it comes to style, all while building her empire as a young entrepreneur.</p><p>Along with setting trends, there has been an increasing number of products being promoted by these beauty influencers lately, whether it be in the form of sponsorships or reviews. One of the most famous examples of these social media-built brands is Huda Beauty. This brand was developed by Huda Kattan, who has been ranked Top Beauty Influencer by Forbes and boasts over 20 million Instagram followers.</p><p>Perhaps the most sought-after product in her makeup line is her false lashes, which hordes of makeup lovers, including Kim Kardashian, swear by. The majority of Kattan’s advertising for the brand is done on her Instagram page, which goes to show just how beneficial it can be to use social media as a publicizing platform.</p><p>Another brand that has earned much praise from the beauty guru community—and thus has seen a major boost in popularity—is Farsali Care. This skincare brand was created by beauty blogger Farah Dhukai and her husband Sal Ali. Like Huda Beauty, Farsali Care is largely promoted on Instagram, where over one million followers can scroll through the brand’s page and view descriptions, advertisements, and reviews of its products. Dhukai further publicizes Farsali Care to almost two million subscribers on her YouTube channel.</p><p>The total revenue of the cosmetic industry was a whopping $62.46 billion in 2016, having risen from $53 billion in 2010, according to statistics portal Statista. During the same period of time, there was a 90 percent increase in the number of beauty channels on YouTube, according to CultureMachines polling firm.</p><p>This flourishing market, nurtured by the growing beauty guru trend, has led to a surge in the popularity of products created by beauty gurus. As these products are reviewed and featured in makeup tutorials and circulated within the beauty community, the gurus encourage viewers to succumb to consumerism culture. Given the huge following that this community maintains, it’s no surprise that marketing done by beauty gurus further propels their popularity as well as their products.</p><p>Beauty influencers are no strangers to sponsorships, either. From teeth whitening kits to tummy toning tea, there is a vast range of products that companies pay beauty gurus to advertise.  Companies often propose sponsorship offers to beauty gurus because of their large following and exposure.</p><p>From their questionable style trends to their signature makeup tutorials, beauty gurus have helped us become desensitized to the practices that would have once resulted in reverberating culture shock, such as boys wearing makeup or people sprinkling glitter in their hair.</p><p>Pictures and videos demonstrating such distinctive applications appear constantly on various platforms of social media, gaining exposure until they finally begin to inspire young people to take part in creating their own unique style, which gradually leads to a stronger sense of self-identity and love.</p><p>This is what sets the youth apart from previous generations: a greater general acceptance of individual flawed beauty, uniqueness, and originality. Beauty gurus have helped us hugely in achieving this, and it seems that they will continue to do so.</p>	Article	45	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
696	﻿Craziest Program Changes (Program Office Hates Them!) Crazy students come into the the program office to ask for a number of whack program changes. <p>At least 100 percent of Stuyvesant students try their hand at “program changes,” or, as you might have seen it manifested, “loudly complaining to guidance and/or anyone who will listen; having concerning mental breakdowns in Ms. Pedrick’s office; lamenting the fact that there are more than two flights of stairs between two classes; and spending a minimum of 25 hours after school in a stress-filled extravaganza only to be told that there was never any space to begin with in that class.”</p><p>And so, year after year, the Program Office faces off with an endless crowd of angry Stuyvesant students, each demanding changes that involve at least 10 teacher swaps and 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 period swaps.</p><p>________________</p><p>Freshman Ovahr Kompensaytin was not looking for any old “Can I not get [fill in unpopular teacher here] this semester” program change. On his mission, Kompensaytin fought his way through the Program Office. When his turn came to be rejected, he confidently strode to the front of the office, not discouraged in the slightest.</p><p>“He looked me straight in the eye, undeterred by our uninterested, monotone voices, and flat-out refusal to consider his predicament,” an unperturbed administrator told us. “Then, he loudly explained that he wanted eight APs before breakfast, including but not limited to AP Biology of Extraterrestrial Species, AP Physics D (the mythological class that succeeds AP Physics C), AP Future History, and AP Lunch. We tried to calmly explain that AP Breakfast was a prerequisite for AP Lunch, but he explained that he intended to double up by having AP Brunch.</p><p>“He also demanded 12 electives that are for seniors only and that he be the only student in the class so that he can have a personal, one-on-one educational experience with the teacher. As for the other 37 APs that he is demanding, he mentioned a ‘strong work ethic’ and enrollment in Stuyvesant High School, which certainly convinced me.”</p><p>________________</p><p>Kompensaytin’s episode was only the beginning. In his stead entered a furious senior, Iza Slackin. “I don’t understand how they could do me dirty like this. Honestly, I feel personally attacked,” Slackin remarked. “I mean, mandatory attendance? Are they serious? I’m a senior. You can’t try to fool me. Get real,” she said.</p><p>Quite reasonably, Slackin desired four periods of lunch, and she also wanted to take a self-made Napping 101 elective. The Program Office pointed out that Slackin had taken five APs junior year with a 98 average and was now pulling up to school for a total of 15 minutes weekly with a 65.001 average.</p><p>________________</p><p>Anxious to get rid of Slackin, the Program Office hurriedly gestured for junior Trayin Tuhard to come in. The epitome of determination and perfectionism, Tuhard was not willing to compromise on any of his desired program changes. His carefully devised stratagem would require 53 maneuvers, including firing multiple beloved teachers, expelling 27 highly qualified students who were placed in the classes he wanted, sending multiple strongly worded e-mails from his parents, and involving Child Protective Services.</p><p>Tuhard insisted that all of his classes be arranged from the 10th floor to the first and that there be an elevator waiting for him on the second floor at 7:55 AM to bring him up to the 10th. In order to accomplish this, he demanded that the physics department be relocated to the cafeteria and that lunch would take place in the library, horrifying Stuyvesant’s dedicated library staff. Unsatisfied with all of his teachers, Tuhard insisted that his English class be taught by Stephen King, his physics class by Stephen Hawking, and his U.S. history class by Barack Obama.</p><p>While the Program Office was hesitant at first, the staff soon realized that while they might be able to shake off Child Protection Services and the whole brunt of the U.S. Department of Education, they simply could not shake off Tuhard and his overbearing parents.</p>	Article	46	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
697	﻿How Impossible Is the Indians Streak? Following a 22-game win streak by the Indians, I take a look at how impossible that really is. <p>From Michael Jordan sending the Cavaliers home in 1989 and a heartbreaking game seven loss in the 1997 World Series to LeBron James taking his talents to South Beach in 2010, Cleveland has a rough history when it comes to sports.</p><p>However, things have started to turn around. LeBron brought a title back to his hometown, and the Indians made it to the World Series. And, even though they lost to the only team with a more pathetic history in the MLB in the Chicago Cubs, there was still hope. Fast forward to August 24 and the Indians were 69-50, atop the AL Central division.</p><p>After five games, they were on a hot streak. After 10, I started following them so closely that I got notifications when they won. After 15, I, along with thousands of MLB fans, was checking the box scores to see if they had gotten any closer to the magic number 20—the American League record set in 2002 by Billy Beane’s Moneyball Oakland Athletics. On the afternoon of September 13, they crossed the metaphorical plateau and cemented the Indians in MLB history, pulling off the seemingly impossible. The streak would end two days later at 22, giving Cleveland the longest winning streak in MLB history.</p><p>So, exactly how impossible was it? While it was incredibly rare, how would it stack up to lightning strikes, three-peats, and coconut deaths? Let’s take a look:</p><p>3000-to-1: Being struck by lightning in your lifetime. Statistically, one out of every Stuy student picking up this paper will be struck by lightning at some point in his or her life. Rare, but we can do better.</p><p>20350-to-1: Being murdered in the United States in a calendar year (2014 statistics). Don’t let this scare you, but you are much more likely to be murdered in the next twelve months than the Indians were to go on this winning streak. But sleep well tonight!</p><p>27000-to-1: Odds of a three-peat in the MLB (or NBA). Even if you assume that all teams are equal, the odds of a three-peat still fall far short of being as rare as Cleveland’s streak.</p><p>75000-to-1: Being hit by a comet. A lot cooler, but nowhere near as rare. Let’s keep going.</p><p>200000-to-1: Giving birth to conjoined twins.</p><p>954056-to-1: Odds of getting into top-five colleges per U.S. News and World Report. Using Class of 2021 statistics and assuming all students are somehow equal, the odds of being accepted into Princeton, Yale, Harvard, University of Chicago, and Columbia are still twice as likely as the Indians’ win streak.</p><p>1048576-to-1: The Athletics’ 20-game winning streak. It doesn’t take a genius to realize this is four times as likely as the 22-game win streak. Still, the record stood for 15 years, and it made a movie about math and baseball interesting.</p><p>2396304-to-1: Throwing back-to-back no-hitters. Seemingly impossible but still less rare than the streak is another amazing accomplishment in MLB history. Accomplished only once by Johnny Vander Meer in 1938, this is a record likely to never be touched with the development of pitch counts and strong bullpens.</p><p>4194304-to-1: The Indians 22-game winning streak.</p><p>250,000,000-to-1: Odds of dying by coconut. As promised, here are the odds of dying by coconut. Coming in as more common than death by shark attack (300,000,000-to-1), death by coconut blows the Indians win streak out of the water in terms of rarity. If the Indians had managed to extend the win streak six more games to 28 in a row, they would have passed the coconut milestone, but now it’ll be a long time before any team comes close to breaking through that barrier.</p>	Article	49	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
698	﻿The Story of Dunkirk “Dunkirk” is not a story about war, but about human endeavor. <p>“Dunkirk” is a movie about war, but doesn’t depict war’s violence. In fact, this film is not really about violent conflict; it is more about what desperate people do in desperate situations.</p><p>The movie opens with  five soldiers rummaging through the deserted French town of Dunkirk. Suddenly, ghostly gunfire sends the soldiers running until there is only one left, who barely makes it over a picket fence to safety. The remaining soldier is the film’s protagonist, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead), and he is characteristically quiet. He later meets another soldier, Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), who buries a dead comrade.</p><p>They emerge on the expansive Dunkirk beach, whose white sands and dull blue skies would be picturesque if it weren’t for the masses of straggling soldiers cooped up on the shores. The scenes following are set mostly on land near the makeshift pier, called “The Mole,” that the Allies are using to evacuate their soldiers from Dunkirk. In the short time that it took for Tommy to go from the town to the beach, the film has already displayed fear, need, and sadness.</p><p>The film switches back and forth between three segments: The Mole, The Sea, and The Air. “The Mole” takes place over the course of a week as Tommy and his fellow soldiers are struggling to survive the chaos that takes place to evacuate Dunkirk’s beaches. “The Sea” is a day onboard the “Moonstone,” a small boat joining an armada of other civilians and their ragtag vessels in an attempt to help rescue the soldiers. “The Air” follows three Spitfire pilots for an hour as they try to bring down enemy planes and protect the escaping minesweepers and boats full of soldiers.</p><p>There is no violence. This film is about its soldiers and rarely does it mention what the war is about or who the enemy is. The soldiers aren’t fighting or participating in typical acts of war. They’re just fighting to survive in acts of human plight. All of the characters look tired, depressed, and pessimistic. The first soldier that the Moonstone rescues is so shell-shocked that he accidentally injures and ultimately kills one of the civilians on board the boat. In an earlier scene, Tommy and Gibson are sitting on the Dunkirk shore after being rescued from yet another sinking ship. A soldier staggers past them and heads right toward the ocean. A wave of foam and water engulfs him, but there is no splashing and struggling for life. The man disappears in an act that says, “This is what war does to men.”</p><p>The movie’s stubborn portrayal of only human endeavors contributes to its intensity. This intensity is based on tension and suspense, not in one realm, but in several as the camera seamlessly moves between Tommy writhing in flaming oily water and a Spitfire pilot thinking he’ll drown in the cockpit of his downed plane. Everything is intertwined by the environment and actions of the characters. Depicting nothing in chronological order is reminiscent of how the average person tells stories, sometimes skipping around or going back and forth between events.</p><p>What the movie lacks in scale, it makes up for by showing the beauty of the basic struggle for life. None of the characters do more than what is necessary in a war where rescuing human lives is a priority. There is no heroic speech or overly patriotic feeling. Plenty of soldiers are traumatized and plenty more die. One of the Spitfire pilots manages to stop an especially deadly German assault on one of the evacuating warships but runs out of fuel and lands far from the pier.</p><p>One of the most beautiful moments in the film is when the pilot sets his plane on fire to prevent it from being used by the Germans. Even as Germans arrive onto the scene, their faces are blurry and the focus stays on the pilot’s figure as he stares at the Spitfire. Defiance and courage in the face of his capture is the only patriotic moment of the film and presents a sense of reassurance and relief.</p>	Article	43	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
699	﻿Trump: Making America Ignorant Again Why transgender people should not be banned from the military. <p>We’re halfway through 2017: Taiwan became the first Asian country to allow same-sex marriage, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau became the first sitting prime minister to participate in the country’s Pride festival, and Malta passed a new act that makes it illegal to try to “change, repress or eliminate a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and/or gender expression.” However, while the rest of the world moves forward this year, the U.S. is taking a major step back. At the end of August, President Trump signed a memo officially banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.</p><p>A year ago, the Obama administration announced that transgender Americans could be in the military, and the Pentagon would cover the costs of those in uniform to go through gender transition. The U.S. had finally seemed to join the list of countries, including the United Kingdom, Israel, and Canada, that were making an effort to move toward a less judgmental society. President Trump is now attempting to undo this step toward equality.</p><p>The Trump administration knows that our military is struggling financially. With low numbers of soldiers, outdated equipment, and too much turmoil around the world, the U.S. military could use as many soldiers as possible, according to the Heritage Foundation’s 2017 Index of U.S. Military Strength. The RAND corporation, a national research and analysis service, found that the new ban would affect from 2,000 to 11,000 active soldiers, as well as thousands who are looking to join. The Heritage Foundation further states that the United States cannot survive such a blow, with troops already deployed in 180 different countries and not enough back home.</p><p>President Trump believes that transgender individuals are too mentally unstable to serve our country, stating that the U.S. cannot be burdened with the “disruption that transgenders in the military would entail.” However, the RAND study, looking at countries that allow transgender people to serve in their militaries, found that these foreign militaries agree that having transgender troops has “little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness.”</p><p>President Trump sees the presence of transgender individuals in the military as entailing “tremendous medical costs and disruption.” He argues that it costs too much for the United States to pay for gender reassignment surgery for its transgender soldiers, taking away from the “decisive and overwhelming victory” our military should win.</p><p>The Obama administration, however, proved the opposite. When President Obama first brought the issue up to the American public, the RAND corporation found that “[U.S. military] health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending.” The slight increase in military spending proved to the Obama administration that allowing transgender individuals into the military did no harm.</p><p>Multiple LGBTQ organizations are filing lawsuits challenging Trump’s new policy, and politicians are joining together to craft acts against the ban. The Stuyvesant community, too, must do what we can to avoid the backward steps that our country is taking. We must stand together as a community to show our opposition to it.</p><p>We must keep our school’s LGBTQ community comfortable and raise awareness that Trump’s policy is discriminatory and unacceptable. The acknowledgement that we, as the student body of Stuyvesant, and as the future generation of New Yorkers and Americans, do not accept or approve of this new ban shows our dedication to equality as well as freedom. While that may not change Trump’s policies toward transgenders, our actions can show the LGBTQ students in our school that they are welcome and respected here.</p>	Article	37	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
700	﻿“Five-Star Dining” at the Cafeteria “Why did I buy popcorn chicken when the cafeteria served this?”—Daniel Ju, senior <p>“Why did I buy popcorn chicken when the cafeteria served this?”—Daniel Ju, senior</p><p>“The kids are literally eating me alive.” —Ling Weenie, AP Lunch teacher</p><p>In years past, Stuyvesant students frequently left the building during their lunch periods to purchase food from local vendors such as Terry’s, “Fake Terry’s” (Ferry’s), and Fake Zucker’s ([redacted]). However, the incentive of free school lunch has drawn many of these lunchtime adventurers to once again enjoy some “good ol’ school lunch.” The reactions to free school lunch have been overwhelmingly positive, as evidenced by the gargantuan line in the cafeteria that resembled the line at program changes.</p><p>“I’ve never tasted anything so divine,” said senior Austin Leung, in describing the school lunch breadsticks. “Their flavorless taste just gives my palate so much more room to experiment with imagining palatable heaven.”</p><p>“The black mold on the bottom of my pizza looks just like the perfect amount of oven crispiness,” Leung continued. “The cheese leaves an excellent feeling in my mouth. It looks and tastes just like my grand-daddy’s colostomy bag. For the record, I have no idea how that tastes, but I think that the pizza comes pretty close.”</p><p>“I think having nails attached to the chicken fingers is a huge improvement!” senior Daniel Ju said. “They add a really surprising crunch to the otherwise tender chicken fingers. Why did I buy popcorn chicken when the cafeteria served this?”</p><p>“My chicken looks like a biology lesson,” freshman Phoebe Park said. “I’m really glad the school had the sensibility to integrate real-world education into the cafeteria. The dissecting fluid really brings this absolutely intoxicating smell to the chicken—I just can’t resist!”</p><p>However, AP Lunch teacher Ling Weenie was strongly pessimistic about the new popularity of the lunchroom. “I don’t know if I can last the whole year!” Weenie exclaimed. “The kids are literally eating me alive—that’s always been the case. But they’ve been so vicious this year! They must be upset that I gave them all Fs and, in one case, salmonella.”</p>	Article	47	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
701	Most Impactful Moves from the 2017 NBA Off-season Summarizing and analyzing the effect of the most impactful moves this NBA off-season. <p>The 2016-2017 NBA season was one of the most exciting seasons in basketball history. The departure of small forward Kevin Durant from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Golden State Warriors caused the former to barely qualify as a playoff team and the latter to win a championship in June. At the same time, his move allowed point guard Russell Westbrook to shatter records that have been in place for over 50 years and emerge as the league’s MVP.</p><p>This proves that one player’s departure from or arrival on a team can profoundly influence the outcome of a NBA season. That’s why this NBA offseason was so interesting: left and right, franchise players left teams they had played their entire careers with while others were traded to a new destination. The movement of so many top-15, and even some top-10, players this offseason will certainly cause below .500 teams to emerge as potential conference-finals contenders. On the other hand, many playoff teams will be forced to undergo the tedious process of rebuilding.</p><p>Arguably the best player to swap jerseys this summer was point guard Chris Paul. The Los Angeles Clippers’ decision to trade their leader and floor general for a bunch of average, and at times even below-average, players from the Houston Rockets shows that they have begun to pursue the process of rebuilding.</p><p>With shooting guard James Harden, the MVP runner-up, and Sixth Man of the Year shooting guard Eric Gordon playing alongside Paul, the Rockets now have a top trio on paper in the Western Conference. Small forward Trevor Ariza, power forward Ryan Anderson, and center Clint Capela each have the capability to contribute some valuable points every night, and their plays can only be enhanced by the excellent passing of Chris Paul.</p><p>Small forward Paul George being traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder was another significant move. George, who averaged 23.7 points per game (PPG) last season will excellently complement MVP point guard Russell Westbrook. Though being on the same team as top-10 NBA players is nothing new for Westbrook, he has the potential to develop a Westbrook-Durant chemistry with George and be extremely dominant when they’re both on the court. This time around, Westbrook will look to take that extra step to win the championship, which eluded Oklahoma City in their years trotting out Durant and Westbrook.</p><p>The arrival of point guard Kyrie Irving and small forward Gordon Hayward in Boston are two acquisitions that bring the Celtics even closer to the caliber of their Eastern Conference rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Both players are dominant scorers and find themselves in the top-15 or top-20 players of the NBA, with Irving averaging 25.2 PPG last season and Hayward having 21.9 PPG. Both players are elite scorers who can explode for 30 or even 40+ points in any given game, and they are surrounded by other highly capable scorers like recently acquired power forward Marcus Morris (14.0 PPG) and center Al Horford (14.0 PPG). Boston’s addition of young and elite scorers will prove to be a smart decision when they are given the opportunity to dethrone the Cavaliers as kings of the East.</p><p>On the other side of the Kyrie Irving trade were the Cleveland Cavaliers, who received  point guard Isaiah Thomas and shooting guard/small forward Jae Crowder. Thomas is one of the league’s truly unstoppable scorers as he averaged 28.9 PPG last season. Offensive-minded guards have historically dominated alongside small forward LeBron James. Crowder is also a skilled scorer (13.9 PPG), whose main contribution is his lockdown perimeter defense, something the Cavaliers have long been desperate for.</p><p>The most surprising team to improve this offseason was the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were able to add small forward Jimmy Butler and point guard Jeff Teague. Butler is one of the best two-way players in the NBA (23.9 PPG & 1.9 steals per game) and continues to improve. Teague is a veteran point guard who has the ability to score and pass well (15.3 PPG and 7.8 assists per game). The addition of an elite two-way player and an able point guard to a team with two players, shooting guard Andrew Wiggins and center Karl-Anthony Towns, who are both under 23 but combine for 50 or 60 points almost every game makes Minnesota a true powerhouse, at least on paper.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the most impactful move this offseason wasn’t a three-team trade or a signing of a big-time free agent. Rather, it was the ability for the Golden State Warriors to keep virtually everyone on their team. Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson are in the prime of their careers and are predicted only to improve. Key players like Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston and role players like Javale McGee were kept, and the Golden State even added role players Omri Casspi and Nick Young. With all the franchise players and NBA stars moving to join better teams, it still may not be enough to stop a repeat in Oakland.</p>	Article	51	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

705	Mr. Polazzo: Preparing Stuyvesant Students to Think Matt Polazzo’s perspective on being a Stuyvesant teacher for 17 years. <p>Hidden in the corner of the Student Union (SU) room is a tiny office with two comfortable couches and a wall covered with a collage of family vacation photos. Government teacher and Coordinator of Student Affairs Matt Polazzo and his family smile down in frozen moments. To the right of his desktop, there are portrait photos of his government students last year and their quotes regarding his class. As I sit down on his couch to begin the interview, SU Vice President Alexa Valentino approaches Polazzo’s office and asks if he has any concerns about the open house event that is going to happen later that day. Polazzo responds,  “Alexa, do you think there is anything more you want to do? If everything is going well, I am confident the open house should run smoothly.”</p><p>Around Stuyvesant,  Pollazo is seen as an intellectual character that works as a strong facilitator, overseeing the SU in general and supervising all major SU events such as SING!. In addition, he challenges the construct of political thought in the classroom. Pollazo has been a teacher at Stuyvesant for 17 years, during which he has taught different levels of social studies.  He is currently teaching Western Political Theory and  US Government, and he will teach Comparative Government in the Spring.</p><p>Polazzo grew up in New York City and attended Saint Ann’s, a small private school in Brooklyn from seventh to 12th grade. The environment of the school was the opposite of Stuyvesant. “The school was very funky, where we called teachers by their first names, and I had 70 kids in my whole graduating class. There were no grades, just written comments,” he said.</p><p>From there, he went to Bowdoin College and obtained a Masters degree in Political Science and decided to become social studies teacher.</p><p>He was the son of an economics teacher at Brooklyn Technical High School. “Growing up, I always thought teaching was a cool profession, but I didn’t know if I wanted to make a life out of it,” Polazzo said.</p><p>After college, he signed up for a program called Teach for America that took high-performing educators and put them in under resourced schools. He was placed at I.S.143 in Washington Heights, where he taught social studies to sixth to eighth graders. Unlike Stuyvesant, I.S. 143 had a largely Dominican student body. “[I strived to be] the teacher I always to wanted to have—approachable and excited about the material,” Polazzo said.</p><p>However, Polazzo didn’t get along with the administration. “I preferred a more student-centered model of learning, and the principal wanted something that to me seemed more rigid and authoritarian,” he said. Polazzo left I.S. 143 after two years of teaching, but he still wanted to continue his teaching career.</p><p>His father knew Assistant Principal of Social Studies Jennifer Suri and suggested that Polazzo apply for a position for a teacher. “I applied because I knew that Stuyvesant was the best school in the city, and I figured it was worth a shot.  I also applied to Brooklyn Tech, and they called me with a job offering 15 minutes after Stuyvesant did.”</p><p>Polazzo applied ambitiously, but after his interview with Suri, he remembered her blatantly telling him, “ It’s a really demanding job, and it’s unlikely that we are going to need you.” Then, on the first day of the 2002-2003 school year,  Polazzo recalled, “[Suri] called me up and said she had a job for me. [At the time,] I was working for a website that was associated with the Conference Board.  It was my job to track down businesses that engaged in socially responsible actions but made money while doing so. I wrote blurbs about them and publicized their good deeds. I quit that job and went on to be a teacher.” But the teacher he was replacing decided to unretire. Later on, around Thanksgiving of 2003, Polazzo replaced a retiring teacher and started working around December of that year, teaching five periods of government classes.</p><p>After teaching government for so long, Polazzo still enjoys the course because government is an important blend of multiple aspects he is interested in: philosophy, economics, and aesthetics. In addition, he enjoys teaching government because there is always something new happening.“In my first years of teaching, the Bush-Gore election was happening, and every day, we would have discussions concerning the controversies of the election. Now, with Trump as President, I have students who I taught years ago, emailing me about impeachment and Constitutional crisis. But in order to declare if something is a Constitutional crisis, you need to understand the Constitution, which I want my students to know,” he explained. The evolving, contemporary questions that students ask stimulate the lessons and structure of government class and Western Political Theory, which focuses on  the teachings of influential Western philosophers.</p><p>For instance, in his Government class, Polazzo acknowledged that he makes the students carry around pocket Constitutions and has them read the document constantly. “We have come to know the strengths and limitations of the document,” he said.“I try to take things [that] seem obscure and boring and strip the mask off and see the power relations that exist underneath it.”</p><p>For example, in one of his class lectures, he talked about congressional staffing. He described the class lecture as something that “seems like a really boring thing to talk about. But when you drill down into the topic, you get to these really interesting questions about how laws can only be written by staffers because the members don’t have time to write laws. However, laws need to be very complicated because government is very complicated. So now, something that seems boring, like congressional staffing, is a matter of a conflict of democratic ideas, because ordinary Americans are unable to read the complicated laws written by congressional staff.”</p><p>Polazzo makes a great effort to explain the deeper issues of government and how they fit into the bigger picture of society as a whole. He often assigns three or four news articles a week based on major debates happening in the country so that students can be aware of current events. He adds on saying, “Recently, we’ve been talking about gun control and the second Amendment after the Last Vegas attack has occurred, the concept of whether or not hate speech exists and whether NFL players or others should respect the flag. If you want to see the constant changing political climate, just open up the New York Times or Breitbart.”</p><p>Western Political Theory, on the other hand, was created by Polazzo. He describes the course as “much more theoretical than the government class. It focuses on the writings of great Western philosophers from Socrates all the way up to Nietzsche.”</p><p>It is important to point out that the majority of Polazzo’s students are juniors and seniors who are paving their lives to higher education and often come from immigrant families and have tremendous pressure to go after high-paying jobs. “I hope my students won’t just sleepwalk into a career where they’re not doing it for the right reasons. Sometimes, on Sunday night, people feel the dread going to school the next day, but I honestly never feel that because I like my job,” he said. “I feel blessed to have the opportunity to come into contact with some of the smartest, most interesting kids in New York City and talk to them in the most pivotal moment in their life. It’s fun to be able to teach young people who tend to be more flexible.”</p><p>Polazzo believes that this generation’s leaders will be Stuyvesant students who are  lifelong learners. “Idealistically, I believe Stuyvesant students should take classes that they thoroughly enjoy. But realistically, students should learn to balance their desire to learn with the need to have a valuable outcome,” he says. “As for advice about life, well that’s hard. Lots of scientific research and personal experience lets us know that to really lead a good life, it is important to maximize on exposure to things you find enjoyable, like spending time on family [and] friends and having amazing experiences and not focus on the acquisition of physical items but still have enough to provide for yourself.”</p>	Article	196	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-12-02 00:21:32.253844
908	﻿“Murder on the Orient Express” Reaches Beyond Its Inspiration How does Kenneth Branagh’s new film adaptation of “Murder on the Orient Express” compare to Agatha Christie’s legendary novel? <p>I must admit I had my reservations while walking into the movie theater showing of “Murder on the Orient Express.” I had only recently read, and loved, the Agatha Christie novel which was adapted for the movie. Not only did I fear being disappointed by the film adaption, notoriously inferior to books, but I also worried that knowing the ending of a murder mystery might ruin the film. Considering the novel’s well-deserved infamy, I was curious as to how the film version, directed by Kenneth Branagh—who also stars as the lead, Detective Hercule Poirot—would handle filling Christie’s big shoes.</p><p>It seems that Branagh accounted for this, however, by opening the film with an entirely original scene set in the bustling and colorful city of Jerusalem. The film uses these few minutes, absent from Christie’s novel, to establish its protagonist as a ridiculous perfectionist with an obsession for balance and a rigid belief in the division between right and wrong.</p><p>Detective Poirot is first shown being comically picky about his breakfast (specifically, the perfectibility of his eggs). He claims to see “imperfection stick out like the nose on your face” and is so troubled by imbalance that when he steps into manure, he purposefully dirties his other foot as well to even it out. Thus, the movie introduces not only a new neurotic element to the famous detective, but instills a sense of humor into him as well.</p><p>When solving a particularly divisive theft (the suspects are a rabbi, a priest, and an imam) at the Wall of Jerusalem prior to his journey on the Orient Express, Poirot establishes a unique crime-solving style. In a long monologue, Poirot relies primarily on his understanding of human nature in order to pinpoint the culprit: he first identifies a plausible motive and uses it to anticipate the evidence, reversing the typical process. Furthermore, Poirot attests that, “There is right. There is wrong. There is no in between,” displaying great faith in his ability to differentiate between the two. It is an innovative effort on behalf of the creators of the film to introduce its protagonist as a genius with a great sense of justice, perhaps a more ethical and extremely French Sherlock Holmes. At the same time, such an effort sets the tone of the movie as the study of a human conscience mixed with comedic elements and modern day messages.</p><p>The film dedicates itself to presenting Poirot as a more human character than the enigma he was in Christie’s time. In the novel, Christie provides little insight into Poirot’s moral compass, primarily focusing on his determination to solve a tricky crime and the ingenuity with which he does this. The film, on the other hand, emphasizes how Poirot handles his idea of ethics, lamenting, “I see evil on this train.” This allows the movie to have a greater meaning than simply a murder mystery and gives Poirot a greater level of complexity (beyond that of a brilliant detective) than he had in the novel.</p><p>The film also establishes the reality of discrimination in 1930s Europe and supports this with greater diversity in casting. Leslie Odom Jr., of Hamilton fame, is an African American who plays the role of Doctor Arbuthnot; and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, who is Hispanic, plays the new role of Biniamino Marquez. Race is a theme in the film notably absent from the 1934 novel, and it reflects a modern influence. For instance, Dr. Arbuthnot relates the difficulty of becoming a doctor as a black man, and the reality that he might be blamed for the murder by the police, simply because of his race, is acknowledged by several characters. This new element allows the film to access more important themes and reflects the influence of persisting societal issues.</p><p>Wisely, Branagh seizes the advantages of the film medium by accentuating the movie’s visual elegance. The contrast between the bright, colorful, lively stations or cities and the more gray-scale, subdued aura of the train is a subtle yet powerful reinforcement of the train’s darker atmosphere. The experimentation with points of view, such as the bird’s eye view of the scene where the body of evil businessman Samuel Ratchett is first found, allows the film to emphasize the cramped and tense atmosphere of the train. Branagh’s use of shots through crystal window reflections create a funhouse mirror effect that emphasizes the lack of transparency aboard the train, drawing audiences in a way that the novel cannot.</p><p>Conversely, the screenwriting of the film instills a humorous and witty tone that perfectly mirrors Agatha Christie’s. Christie’s ironic tone throughout the novel is a significant part of its appeal, and while the film does a good job in capturing Poirot’s dry humor, it is Bouc, a reinvisioned character played by Tom Bateman, who provides much of the film’s comedy. A shameless hedonist (in his first scene, he is seeking a remote place in which to have a twenty minute “argument” with a prostitute), he serves as the perfect foil to Poirot’s astute character—a young man not yet disillusioned with the world. He seems an even better companion to Poirot than Christie wrote in the novel, accentuating Poirot’s professionalism while also bringing out his humorous side as Poirot frustrates Buoc with comments about the mystery such as, “If it were easy, I would not be famous.”</p><p>Considering the fame of the novel, much of the film’s success seemed as though it would inevitably rest on performance, rather than plot. This might explain why the movie’s cast consists almost entirely of heavy-hitting actors: Dame Judy Dench, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Derek Jacobi are just a few of the huge names associated with the film. However, it is a somewhat disappointing ensemble cast, if only because in its excessive focus on Poirot, the film gives the other actors little time to fully distinguish their talent.</p><p>Despite their confines, the cast is still able to put on an impressive performance. The drama in the movie was greatly elevated, specifically in Poirot’s confrontation with Dr. Arbuthnot, where the latter confesses to the crime and shoots Poirot to protect his lover, Mary Debenham (played by Daisy Ridley) from suspicion. This scene, too, is original, and sharply differs from the more subdued and slow-burning nature of Christie’s novel. The film’s climax, Poirot’s confrontation with the suspects, in the conclusive test to their characters, has a far greater emotional appeal to the audience than the book. By stressing Poirot’s insistence that the world is black and white, the film makes his reaction to a totally in-the-gray situation compelling in a way that the novel is not quite able to.</p><p>While the film is unlikely to receive the same cult following as its novel predecessor, it is a refreshing take on Agatha Christie’s beloved novel. It is simultaneously able to give the story a new level of complexity as well as retain the suspense and charm of an old-fashioned murder mystery, and perhaps by those merits alone can be considered a success.</p>	Article	306	2017-12-21 22:16:48.821215	2017-12-21 22:16:48.821215
702	﻿A Difficult Start for the Peglegs The Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, kicks off its season with a loss, but are looking for a quick bounce back. <p>The Peglegs, the boys’ soccer team, had their first game of the season on Wednesday, September 13, against long-time rival Martin Luther King Junior High School (MLKHS) Knights. Their first official match was scheduled for Saturday, September 10, against Julia Richman Education Complex, but it was postponed due to the other team’s lack of available players. Unfortunately, the Peglegs’ game against MLKHS resulted in a 4-0 loss.</p><p>The Knights are the defending city-wide champions. In both of their games last year, the Peglegs lost to the Knights 7-0. “We are in a very rough division, having to play Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass Academy [in] four out of 10 games,” coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>During Wednesday’s game, the Knights had the opportunity to launch 13 shots against the Peglegs, who were only able to shoot four.</p><p>After losing six vital seniors from last year, the players are looking to other members of the team to step up in the starting lineup. “Players like [sophomore] Henry Kotkin, [sophomore] Lewis Woloch, and [sophomore] Jeremy Moller will be filling the void last year’s seniors [left]. [Senior] David Power will also be our new starting goalkeeper,” Miller said. Power was able to save eight of the 12 shots at the goal at Wednesday’s game, proving his capabilities.</p><p>Though the Peglegs lost, they proved that they were able to compete against the toughest of opponents. “We plan to make the playoffs this season. That's always our long-term goal,” Miller said. “[I am] confident [the team] will play hard and look to win some of those tough games.”</p><p>As the season goes on, the Peglegs will be looking to improve their finishes and possession in games. “I think we can improve our aggression when going in for tackles and also [work] to keep the ball against high-pressing teams,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzburg said.</p>	Article	50	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
703	﻿Seeds of Peace  <p>The first day of Seeds of Peace was a party. First impressions consisted of smiles, laughs, flailing limbs, and offbeat cheering. As buses rolled in weighed down by kids who had flown thousands of miles from countries most Americans can’t point out on a map, I felt, for the first time in a long time, joy.</p><p>The genius of Seeds of Peace international camp starts off with that first day. Counselors carrying a motley assortment of instruments and noisemakers cheer so loud you can’t quite make out the words. Campers, who have already arrived, form a tunnel with their reaching arms and interlaced fingers. Every camper who runs off the bus runs into an embrace. The support, the joy, the unapologetic dancing, spurs smiles and quick introductions. This initial openness was what made me feel at home from the moment I stepped off the bus.</p><p>Over the course of three and a half weeks, these small connections served as the genesis of relationships that form the foundation for Seeds of Peace.</p><p>The Seeds of Peace Camp international session is an international program held in Otisfield, Maine every summer for three and a half weeks from late June to late July. Journalist John Wallach and Program Developer Bobbie Gottschalk founded Seeds of Peace in 1993, the same year as the Oslo Accords attempted and failed to establish a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine.</p><p>Since its inception, Seeds has brought Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian, and American youth (or “seeds”) to Maine in order to facilitate meaningful dialogue between youth on the opposing sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In recent years, Seeds has also established a South Asian program, including seeds from India and Pakistan to discuss the conflict between their countries.</p><p>At Seeds, next to the beautiful Pleasant Lake in Maine, you eat, sleep, play sports, and make music like any other American summer camp. However, you do this while engaging in camp activities where you talk to, learn from, and make friends with people whose experiences, ideology, and cultural sensibilities may be markedly different from yours.</p><p>In a bunk of ten boys, Indians share a bathroom with Pakistanis. At a table, Jews share a meal with Muslims. One of the immediate and striking components of the camp is the unspoken and gratuitous acceptance of diversity. There is a familiarity that accompanies cohabitation.</p><p>Part of every day was spent in dialogue. Groups of campers would make their way to dialogue huts, each with two trained facilitators. Tasked with discussing conflicts, that for many campers, are an ever-present and ugly component of their daily lives, seeds embark on a prodigious and often painful mission of understanding, of communication, and of comprehension, unfettered by bigotry or stereotype.</p><p>Every day campers would walk out of their dialogue huts sometimes frustrated and drained, but also absurdly yet understandably happy that someone from the other side of the conflict had heard them and listened.</p><p>“Trust the process” they told us in dialogue. And I did. While at times I was doubtful of what we were doing, I trusted the people I spent my entire day with. In my South Asian dialogue, we talked about equity and equality, about terrorism, about Kashmir, about Islam.</p><p>I listened as one of my best friends struggled to defend her religion and we cried together. I listened at night as my bunkmate told me stories about bombs and checkpoints and soldiers. Listening was central to my experience both in dialogue and in camp in general.</p><p>Unlike The Palestinians or Israelis, I have no direct stake in the conflict. Instead I sought to understand the experiences that informed each camper’s opinions, how each camper moved, existed, and understood structures and systems to help make sense of the world around them. A Muslim camper explained to me that while she believed her religion to be morally right in every aspect, humans are prone to fallacy and misinterpretation. We had entire dialogues spent discussing whether Muslim terrorists are actually Muslim. I became friends with a Catholic Palestinian girl who has to drive hours to the nearest town with a church every Sunday. I met a camper from the Gaza Strip who described it as Hell.</p><p>I trusted the process. I spent hours in the lake staring out at the mountains. I spent hours in my bunk at night using the dim light of my iPod to help illuminate the process of my thoughts becoming words as I wrote in my journal. I argued, I sang in the shower, I witnessed Muslims unroll their prayer mats in the direction of Mecca and prostrate themselves at night. I unpacked everything and saw the beauty and importance in the struggle of what we were doing.</p><p>I spent hours listening to people talk about their lives, their hopes, and fears. I had the realization over and over again that the worlds the other campers lived in were so far removed from mine, that I truly live in a bubble; to understand their experiences, I had to transcend prejudices that I didn’t even realize I had.</p><p>I played sports, I played music, I wrote poetry, I listened to poetry, I found spaces to discuss issues and thoughts about race and oppression and roots I never realized I had opinions about. As cheesy as it sounds, I tried to live in the moment, to be present, and to see people beyond their opinions or words.</p><p>For every tear shed or chair thrown in a dialogue hut, there were countless moments of simple humanity and friendship. I talked with an Egyptian girl about why she no longer wears shorts in public. I wrote poetry with a Jewish-American girl who found herself becoming increasingly pro-Palestine as camp progressed. I listened to Pakistani music and talked to another Egyptian girl about the SAT. I walked past the lake sandwiched between two of my best friends at camp: an Israeli and a Palestinian. I constantly asked myself, “What is happening here?”</p><p>With no phones for three and a half weeks, all we were left with were thoughts and ideas. “Be raggedy,” they told us. To be raggedy means to be unafraid to give voice to ideas that you may not have the right words for, but that hold truth. And, being raggedy was cleansing. Once I exposed myself for the world to see, my ideas and beliefs were shaped and strengthened by the crucible of constant questioning.</p><p>I talked to a Muslim boy who was homophobic as a result of his never having been exposed to queerness. I asked him why he thought what he thought. He told me and I disagreed, but I understood what informed his beliefs, and I saw the person as separate from the opinions.</p><p>It’s hard to believe all this happened in three and a half weeks. Looking back, I think of it as a lifetime. A lifetime broken into moments during which I grew years. A lifetime broken into entire hours, entire conversations spent trying to search for that one tiny shared truth that would allow us to truly understand one another. To remember who you were going into an experience, and to see that the person coming out of it is completely different, is a truly humbling realization.</p><p>It’s impossible to say whether Seeds of Peace will ever accomplish its underlying purpose of one day solving the Israeli-Palestinian and Indian-Pakistani conflicts. In fact, talking to many seeds as camp drew to an end, it seemed that many had confirmed and strengthened the beliefs they came to camp with. When viewed in the context of a world that is becoming increasingly polarized, where political views have become progressively more synonymous with morality and decency, when conflict seems ever more prevalent in our lives, Seeds of Peace is failing its original mission.</p><p>However, even those who left Seeds feeling more righteous in their opinions, who believe with assiduous conviction that their side has the moral high-ground, have spent three weeks living and creating a shared space with the other side. Even those who will go back to their country to join the army, playing an active role in the conflict, know those they are fighting as people. Even those who experience conflict daily know how to use their words and ideas productively, or at least cathartically, as an alternative to violence.</p><p>I'm still in the process of trying to unpack and explore the ways in which camp has changed me. I still have yet to cauterize some of the wounds it has opened. I struggle to keep in touch with friends living in different time zones. I now try to keep up with news from seven different countries. I have to worry about friends who live in active conflict zones, who have to navigate checkpoints and soldiers.</p><p>I have to come to terms with living in a country that is increasingly candid about not wanting me. I have to watch as people kill and hate and dehumanize others. Everywhere I look, I see situations where the one thing lacking is dialogue.</p><p>One concrete thing Seeds has given me is conviction: I want to bring this space into a world with so many opinions and so little listening.</p><p>As the Persian poet Rumi wrote, and social justice activists often quote: “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field, I’ll meet you there.”</p><p>With Seeds, I found the field.</p>	Article	53	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
704	Writing Center Moved to Room 615F The writing center has moved from the library to room 615F. <p>The Writing Center has been moved from the library to room 615F, following a joint decision by Principal Eric Contreras, Assistant Principal of English Eric Grossman, the English department, and the librarians.</p><p>The decision to relocate the Writing Center was made to make the library a quieter place to study. “It was tricky to have two separate entities running in the same space when different rules apply to each,” said English teacher Holly Schechter, who runs the writing center.</p><p>Room 615F is located just down the hall from the library and is adjacent to Grossman’s office. The room used to serve as a storage closet that was only accessible through the neighboring room 615E, but has since had a proper doorway cut out, connecting it to the hall. The new writing center still needs some refurbishment.</p><p>Many students and teachers believe that this change is beneficial. “The change of location will hopefully bring more students in because there will be no more confusion related to waiting on the library line,” student editor and junior Julia Arancio said.</p><p>Schechter agreed, and said, “Having our own space is a giant step forward for the Writing Center.  It legitimizes the important work we are doing.”</p><p>The Writing Center will remain open from fourth to eighth period and will have student teachers and volunteers working alongside Schechter. “We have a strong team of five student teachers and twenty students, selected by application, who devote their free time to helping other students with their writing,” Schechter said.</p>	Article	54	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
706	﻿A Semper-ternal Beginning A mix of vocalists perform in subways and on the streets as they spread their love for music. <p>Posted on stairwells and on walls throughout the school are messages of clubs seeking out fresh faces, new names, and raw talent. Among the mix of different vocal groups and long-standing clubs is Semper, a newly-formed choral music club led by seniors Grace McManus and Alex Whittington. Behind its unique name are stories that propel the spirit of its members.</p><p>Semper is Latin for “always,” and to Whittington, that word in a language that has transcended time describes music perfectly. “When I discovered choral music, it was this massive collection of the human experience over centuries and even millennia. [Always] defines humanity in a sense. It’s everlasting, it’s sempiternal, it’s ongoing, and I feel like that applies to the music,” he said.</p><p>The members didn’t expect to develop a profound interest in choral music. Coming to Stuyvesant provided the opportunity of taking a chorus class. Whittington and member of the Semper board, senior Milo Rosengard, auditioned together, having been in the same art appreciation class.</p><p>Rosengard has been playing the piano since he was four but didn’t express a serious interest toward singing until he started chorus. “We meet every day, and the caliber of what we sing and the level at which we sing it were a lot higher than anything I had experienced before,” he said. Chorus, now subdivided into the groups Madrigal, Oratorio, and Concert, introduced a greater range of chamber music and singing techniques. Rosengard added, “I was very good at sight-singing and took several advanced theory courses. Being around Ms. [Holly] Hall and Ms. [Liliya] Shamazov definitely helped me improve because not only do they teach right notes and rhythms, they focus on posture and how to project your voice.”</p><p>One of the transformative moments for Whittington was singing Giuseppe Verdi’s Messa de Requiem during the second semester of freshman year. Up until that point, chorus was mainly a way for meeting people. But to be able to sing music that required hours of work on just one measure but ultimately produced an astounding sound was what affected him the most. “I somehow got blessed with this amazing opportunity to perform possibly one of the greatest choral masterpieces that has ever existed. That altered me on an emotional and personal level,” he said. “The sentiments and the feelings that were evoked as a result of me forming a part of the choir that went to Carnegie Hall—that launched me into my fascination with choral music,” he said. It’s amazing how the requiem carried raw human emotions over centuries to inspire people today.</p><p>Before Semper became official, it was just McManus and Whittington performing in subways and plazas. They wanted to extend their passion and what they enjoyed doing to a more publicized and larger community. One memorable recollection was when they sang Verdi’s Dies Irae. They had attempted to condense a four-voice, polyphonic piece into a two-voice piece. The reduction from a full-sized choir to just two people singing might have appeared to others as odd and a bit sad, but in that moment, it was exhilarating.</p><p>Whittington’s passion for music and desire to form a larger community are what motivated him to create Semper. He explained, “It’s definitely become something so near and dear to my heart, as a result of that one experience. I wouldn’t even put a label on it; it’s just something I enjoy doing so much and I love that it’s a part of me. I wanted to extend this feeling to a larger community, and as an individual, I also really like meeting new people and seeing what’s out there.” Every experience mirrored their earlier performances, even if they had to move to where no one could hear them and busy New Yorkers kept on walking.</p><p>As they started to bring in more people, through recruiting chorus members and featuring the club throughout the school, what started out as a recreational activity grew into something more along the lines of a family.</p><p>During auditions, the leaders conducted similar exercises to those done in chorus auditions. Rosengard said, “We looked for good singers. We did scales, arpeggios, and pitch matching where I play a short pattern or melody and the person has to repeat it back.” One exercise, called pitch integrity, was nicknamed “torture” because the singer had to sustain a note while other notes were being sung. Through these rigorous exercises, the board recruited several well-experienced members to kickstart the club off into the new school year.</p><p>Rehearsals would most likely involve sectionals, where the different voice groups would divide and learn their parts of a piece. Tentatively speaking, the group plans on performing at Brookdale Senior Living across the street from Stuyvesant. McManus and Whittington plan on putting together a Christmas program for the holiday season. Whittington revealed, “The Christmas music spans from the more pop songs, like Jingle Bells and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, to traditional Latin songs that have been adapted for the 21st century. The holiday season is one of my favorite times of the year, so we’re trying to create a program that is evocative of sentiments of peace, joy, and renewal.”</p><p>Already, the seniors of the club are fast-forwarding to the future when they will eventually leave for college. There is an inexplicable and mutual understanding among the members that undoubtedly maintains and propels Semper. Whittington said, “I feel like the sense of family and community is something that is ‘always’ or will always last. I’m a senior, and I’m going off to college next year, but I feel like this is something I’ll always keep with me.”</p><p>As for their legacy in Stuyvesant, there is no hint of doubt of what will happen. Taking into account several factors, Rosengard assured, “We’re going to have good people taking over for us when we leave. A significant percentage of the people we sang with before we created Semper is underclassmen. I’m confident that Semper will continue to thrive after we leave Stuy.”</p>	Article	59	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

Being truthful was mentioned as an afterthought — “truth”... <p>During the Stuyvesant Open House on Wednesday, October 11th, volunteers were explicitly told to be positive. Being truthful was mentioned as an afterthought — “truth” meaning, don’t give fictional accounts, but still omit Stuyvesant’s problems whenever possible.</p><p>Tour guides walked through the seventh floor, endlessly praising our biology program but neglecting to mention SPARK, along with the mental health issues and identity struggles many students grapple with. Big Sibs even removed Copies of Issue 2 of the Spectator, which featured unfavorable statistics (such as over 70 percent of seniors having engaged in academic dishonesty), from their stands on the bridge.</p><p>Despite being far from ideological repression or labeling student journalism “fake news,” this hushing-up marks a frightening trend: prioritizing the Stuyvesant brand over the well-being of prospective students, to the point of restraining certain critical voices.</p><p>Thousands of eighth graders across the city are making a difficult choice regarding the next four years of their lives, and Stuyvesant’s student body and administration have an obligation to help them make the most informed decision possible. This means not censoring Stuyvesant’s dark side, but revealing it, whether that means academic dishonesty, the school’s racial composition, or what can become a very cut-throat student environment.</p><p>Imagine applying to an internship or summer program, being accepted, and finding out on the first day that it requires twice as many hours as advertised; seniors, imagine applying to a college for its student body and never learning the school has a drug problem. You would feel cheated, misled, or even exploited.</p><p>In a political climate in which journalism and the truth are under attack, Stuyvesant —  which our Open House would have us believe represents the best and brightest in the city — should meet a higher standard.</p><p>Similarly, we should not submit ourselves, as current students, to an echo chamber about a fairy land called Stuyvesant. This is a great school, not a perfect one, and refusing to represent certain truths renders them invisible and devalues their effects on the student body. The experiences of a bubbly Open House leader are no more valid than those of students who forego extracurriculars because they are struggling academically, or of students whose emotional health has deteriorated due to Stuyvesant’s sometimes toxic atmosphere.</p><p>Students who struggle with, or are honest about, Stuyvesant’s negative aspects are not trying to ruin its reputation; if Stuyvesant is truly deserving of our praise, then the good will outweigh the bad.</p>	Article	60	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
708	﻿Being Attracted To Kids Is Not A Choice, It’s A Monstrosity  <spec-reference id=36></spec-reference><p>Recent years have seen an increase in calls to reduce the stigma of pedophilia, borne from parallel movements of destigmatizing mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety. However, not all disorders were created alike—unlike most common mental illnesses, pedophilia is inherently predatory and a danger to our society. Though pedophilia is a paraphilic disorder, phrasing it simply as a “sexual preference” is a colossal injustice to the millions of lives destroyed by pedophiles. A sexual preference is “I prefer bigger women,” or “I like men with beards”; pedophilia is the most severe atrocity known to man.</p><p>Pedophile sympathizers argue that encouraging pedophiles to openly take part in society helps them avoid criminal behavior. This is an unnerving mentality, for the simple reason that pedophiles pose a greater threat in their potential proximity of children than when pushed to the fringes of society where they belong. The reputation of pedophiles as skilled manipulators of children is not an undeserved one. According to a 2003 National Institute of Justice report, three out of every four adolescent sexual assault victims knew their attackers well. This throws a wrench in the attempt to portray pedophiles as victims petrified by desires that take over and cause them to pounce on nearby children in the heat of their impulses.</p><p>In reality, pedophiles gain access to their victims by integrating themselves into the lives of children close to them (through schools, churches, family friends, youth sports teams, etc.), and then by winning the trust of the child, who instinctively turns to the adult for support and attention. The adult then initiates the gradual process of sexualizing this relationship and desensitizing their victims to inappropriate behavior. Once successful, they continue to escalate their harassment until their victim is fully under their control, emotionally isolated, and not likely to speak out against them. This system is carefully controlled, purposeful, and requires caution and patience from pedophilic predators—nothing about it is impetuous or “compulsory.” The fact that they blend in well with ordinary society, that they could be your next-door neighbor or local Little League coach, makes them more dangerous, not more sympathetic.</p><p>The juxtaposition of gay people and pedophiles stems from the same foul logic as pedophile apologism itself. Yes, parallels can be drawn between the way gay people and pedophiles were and are viewed; parallels can also be drawn between the way pedophiles and kinksters are viewed, or the way pedophiles and prostitutes are viewed. However, none of these parallels are relevant or add credibility to the case for pedophile sympathy because they aren’t comparable to the inherent predatory nature of pedophilia. Correlation never implies causation: just because homosexuality and pedophilia were once reviled does not mean it was deservedly so for both, and just because society has become more tolerant toward the LGBT community doesn’t mean pedophiles deserve the same. Furthermore, considering the history gay men have had with being accused of being perverts and lumped in with pedophiles by virtue of their sexuality, another attempt to create a catch-all category with “sexual deviance” as the criteria—the only trait desperately straining to connect pedophilia and homosexuality—falls spectacularly flat.</p><p>Not only is victimizing pedophiles misguided, it’s also actively harmful. Painting pedophiles as suffering victims imparts the wrong message upon impressionable children, especially when reporting rates are already at such an astonishing low. Even with pedophilia as widely stigmatized as it is today, only an estimated one in 20 cases of child sexual abuse, or CSA, are reported. Within that narrow margin, even with definite proof of penetration, only five to 15 percent of child victims will have genital injuries consistent with recognized sexual abuse. This isn’t even accounting for the fact that CSA isn’t solely limited to physical contact; it includes exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography, which are much harder to expose and successfully prosecute without the testimony of the victim or video footage of the crime. Even in cases when the victim was not manipulated into staying silent, the odds are stacked against them. These facts form a grim image: in a world where pedophilia is chased in the shadows, shining a sympathetic spotlight on pedophiles drives their victims further into the dark.</p><p>If pedophilia can indeed be curbed to an extent, our society’s heavy moral stigma is what is keeping those “hidden” pedophiles terrified to offend. Plenty of pedophiles already create justifications out of thin air for their desires and actions, such as claiming they were seduced by their victims or arguing that they were providing their victims with a higher level of spiritual education. Without the stigma attached to pedophilia, these pre-existing trends of rationalization will skyrocket—after all, destigmatizing pedophilia validates pedophiles’ acts of self-victimization.</p><p>There are many who believe that pedophiles can be rehabilitated, and that the risk of allowing pedophiles to roam freely is well worth the reward of treatment that has supposedly proven to be successful. It’s important to remember that there is no way to measure the efficacy of a treatment of this kind with complete accuracy because of the high rate of unreported cases, and because in this situation, it’s impossible to ethically conduct an experiment to test if a treatment is working, as is done with other forms of treatment.</p><p>That said, there are still a variety of methods used to attempt to treat pedophilia. One such method is the use of hormone treatments, such as Androgen Deprivation Therapy and progestogens as libido inhibitors—in other words, chemical castration. Though it was partially effective in reducing the libidos of participants, sexual desire cannot be completely eliminated by chemical castration, which led to rising doubts about the efficacy of the treatment and the potential risk of releasing sex offenders who still experienced sexual desire for children. The treatment is also unreliable by its very nature because the patient must be depended on to regularly take his medication. Additionally, sex drive is not the only factor involved in CSA; in fact, it’s not even the primary factor. Stemming from their emotional and mental attraction to children, some pedophiles often believe that they have a uniquely close relationship with their victims, and that they love and care for them in a special way. This denial runs deep; there are pedophiles who even believe their victims asked for their “bond.” For other pedophiles, sexual contact with children is a way for them to feel powerful and in control of their own lives while simultaneously fulfilling their needs. Neither of these issues can be touched by libido inhibitors.</p><p>Another common treatment utilized for pedophilia is therapy. There are only a few therapeutical studies on patients with pedophilia, but the results those yielded are mostly negative or inconclusive. A group of researchers, published in the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology, found that sex offenders who completed therapy weren’t any more likely to be empathetic toward their past victims than sex offenders who hadn’t completed therapy. One randomized controlled trial meant to evaluate the efficacy of a relapse prevention program showed that after eight years, sex offenders who underwent the therapeutical program and control groups who did not both experienced the same rates of recidivism.</p><p>Some protest that the U.S.’s mandatory reporting laws, which require that professionals who work with children be trained to spot signs of child abuse and report it, keep pedophiles from seeking treatment that would ultimately better them, but the evidence above illustrates the futility of such efforts. In fact, mandatory reporting laws need to be enforced, not relaxed. The dismissal of Syracuse assistant basketball coach Bernie Fine and the arrest of Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky—both for sexually abusing young boys—demonstrates the need to seal loopholes in our child protection system. Though both men and their staff worked with college students officially, they regularly worked with kids of all ages in summer camps. Since the staff were officially employed at a university, they were not trained as mandated reporters. As a result, these tragedies quietly slipped through the cracks.</p><p>The case for minimizing pedophilia in our society seems bleak, but if we look past our myopic emphasis on victimizing the child predators responsible, heartening news lies ahead of us. According to the records of law enforcement agencies, sexual crimes against U.S. children declined 53 percent between 1992 and 2006. The most likely causes were increased amounts of police and CPS workers and stronger efforts to prosecute child sex offenders. This demonstrates that what we need to crack down on child molestation isn’t misplaced sympathy, but the enforcement of our current protective laws and a firm emphasis on pedophiles’ status as monsters, not sufferers. Public education programs (such as stopitnow.org) educating bystanders on how to act on their suspicions of CSA have also proven useful. Instead of investing any kind of energy into caring about pedophiles, we need to band together and return to prioritizing child safety over pedophile feelings.</p>	Article	61	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
709	﻿The Pinnacle of Time Management A student builds a time machine to study for the AP World test. <p>With the APs quickly approaching, many Stuyvesant students have their noses buried in test-prep books as if they were searching for a second-term senior’s commitment to school. Others completely replace studying with the time-honored tactic of not studying. Sophomore Andrew Werner, on the other hand, has brought his third-best idea—after his wildly successful Flag Rugby team and Satanic Ritual club—to fruition: a time machine. “This machine will revolutionize the way students study for history tests. We can watch history like we watch Netflix,” Werner said.</p><p>AP World History teacher Zachary Berman gave his thoughts on Werner’s creation: “While it’s a marvel of science, a time machine simply isn’t practical. History is long, and events like the Attack of the Clones require context and 30 shekels to fully understand. A better application of the time machine may be to actively change history so you can’t possibly get anything wrong on the AP test!” Berman proceeded to wear off his caffeine high by spinning around like a Sufi.</p><p>While altering the past seems tempting, telling yourself from the beginning of the semester to prepare a textbook-sized outline to cram the night before the test seems more practical. Anyway, the odds of riding along with Werner are slim since the whole sophomore class is clamoring for a seat like it’s an open computer at the printing station, so good luck!</p>	Article	187	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
710	National Genes in Space Competition Won by Sophomore Elizabeth Reizis Sophomore Elizabeth Reizis won the National Genes in Space competition for her experiment on the effects of microgravity on immune system cell differentiation, marking Stuyvesant’s second win in a row. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Sophomore Elizabeth Reizis’ experiment on the effects of microgravity on immune system cell differentiation tied for first place in the National Genes in Space competition, which concluded on June 20. Reizis shared the first place position with Sophia Chen from Lakeside, Washington, and both experiments will be performed on board the International Space Station (ISS) in June 2018.</p><p>Reizis’ victory marks the second year in a row a Stuyvesant student has won the competition. Senior Julian Rubinfien won first place in the 2016 Genes in Space competition, focusing on the adverse effects a change in telomere lengths have on aging.</p><p>Genes in Space, a competition for students in grades seven to 12, asks students to come up with an experimental proposal in which they attempt to address a challenge in space travel. In their proposals, students are required to show proper usage and understanding of polymerase chain reactions. They are then expected to use the ISS as the test site for the proposal.</p><p>Reizis’ proposal went through a rigorous selection process beginning in April of this year and ending in May with the announcement of 25 awardees. Among these was Stuyvesant senior Kai Hin Lui, who received an honorable mention. Reizis was then named one of five finalists and met with a Ph.D. mentor from Harvard to refine her proposal.</p><p>Finalists presented their ideas at the ISS Research and Development Conference in Washington, D.C., during mid-July. “As a usually shy person, the thought of presenting in front of a large audience and a panel of judges seemed absolutely terrifying. When I walked into the presentation room, I could feel my laser pointer shaking in my hands. But, when I started talking about the idea that I had worked on for so long, I realized that there was no need to overthink,” she said.</p><p>Reizis’ proposal addresses immunodeficiencies astronauts face during and after space travel. She designed her experiment to focus on the effect microgravity has on T-cell development. T-cells are a type of white blood cell that help defend the body from pathogens. They are able to recognize cancerous, infected, and foreign cells by use of protein receptors on their cell membranes.</p><p>To make a variety of T-cell receptors, different segments of DNA are cut out and switched around. The resulting DNA is a T-cell Receptor Excision Circle (TREC), circular strands of DNA formed from cut-out parts of a long strand of DNA of a developing T-cell.</p><p>“My objective is to study the rate of T-cell development by measuring the number of [TRECs] in the astronauts’ blood,” Reizis said.</p><p>The maturation of a T-cell will usually result in the production of only one TREC. By measuring the amount of TRECs in the blood, Reizis plans to find the rate of T-cell development in space.</p><p>Reizis and Rubinfien’s success in the competition has opened doors for them in the field. “I have had the chance to network and discuss future plans with many scientists all over, many of whom were very willing to assist me in finding internships and labs in their own or other fields,” Reizis said. “I’m incredibly grateful for all the possibilities that this competition has brought me.”</p><p>Both Reizis and Rubinfien credit honors biology teacher Jessica Quenzer for pushing them to apply for the competition and for helping them edit and refine their proposals. “After reading about the past winners and researching the current issues surrounding spaceflight, I was eager to write up my own draft of ideas,” Reizis said. “Ms. Quenzer encouraged our whole class to apply, and I decided that it was not an opportunity I wanted to miss and quickly sent in my research proposal.”</p><p>Quenzer hopes to continue this winning streak by continuing to encourage students to enter the Genes in Space competition. She plans to make the Genes in Space proposal a mandatory assignment.</p>	Article	3	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
711	“The College Essay Guidebook”: A Look into Dr. Mandler’s Latest Book Dr. Mandler has published his newest book, a manual dedicated to helping high school students write their college essays. <p>English teacher Dr. David Mandler’s latest book, “The College Essay Guidebook,” was released on September 25. The book includes 30 activities that help  guide the reader to writing effective responses to the Common Application questions. It also includes a grammar section and essay draft progressions from former Stuyvesant seniors.</p><p>Dr. Mandler has published another book, a nonfiction work titled “Arminius Vambéry and the British Empire: Between East and West,” as well as a short story, and numerous articles in the Budapest Times.</p><p>He wrote his latest book to help his students, as well as others across the country, produce an effective story about themselves. “I had to do something to guide people. It’s really in the spirit of alleviating much of the stress that students feel in creating an essay that I wanted to do this book,” Dr. Mandler said.</p><p>The new book also includes student reflections from seniors who have gone through the college process. “I find that this book is very relevant, especially to Stuyvesant students, because the advice in the book comes straight from last year’s seniors,” Dr. Mandler said. “They allowed me to integrate some of their essays, using their names and college affiliations. But the book is open enough to allow for any other high school senior to understand.”</p><p>He also chose to create a publishing press for this book, the “Ergo Sum Press.” The name is derived from Descartes’s “I think, therefore I am.” “The major negative [of] looking for a publisher is the time period,” Dr. Mandler said. “[It takes] at least a year or two for a book to run the course of selection. I wanted to retain control over what the book looked like. When you go with a publisher, you give up a lot of control of what goes into the book.”</p><p>Dr. Mandler is also in the process of writing two more texts: a novel and a book of poetry.</p>	Article	56	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
712	﻿Rowell’s Best: Favorites from a Fan Some of Rainbow Rowell’s best works <p>Though a fairly recent name in literature, Rainbow Rowell has quickly secured her place as the voice of a generation. Originally a columnist and ad copywriter at the Omaha World-Herald, Rowell began writing as a pastime. Best known for her work in the young adult scene, Rowell is a versatile writer that tackles the messiness of life and people as they fall in and out of love. In her books, Rowell plays with time and structure to craft authentic characters. The simplicity and raw emotion of Rowell’s writing creates a profoundness and depth that feels genuine, rather than forced, like a more delicate John Green. Through pop culture references and a modern writing style, Rowell is able to connect to young and old.</p><p>Fangirl</p><p>“Fangirl” centers around Cath Avery, a Simon Snow fangirl and famous fanfiction writer, who heads off to college with her twin sister, Wren. Once inseparable, Wren decides she wants be independent in college, leaving Cath alone to find her way and figure out who she is. The journey is long and uncomfortable. Cath, for example, stays in her dorm room eating protein bars to avoid the possible awkwardness of the cafeteria and has dance parties in her room. Because of this, Cath is utterly lovable in her relatability, and ends up triumphant because despite pressures to party and stop writing fanfictions, Cath embraces and holds on to who she is. A cast of quirky characters accompanies Cath: her confident, vulgar, but kind roommate Reagan, Reagan’s charming friend Levi, Cath’s lonely and mentally unstable father, and fellow English major Nick.</p><p>“Fangirl” is interlayered with excerpts of Cath’s own fanfiction, the magical, Harry Potter-like world of Simon Snow mirroring Cath’s complicated life. The excerpts, though entertaining stories on their own, subconsciously reveal Cath’s frustrations and the lessons she learns. “Fangirl” shines in revealing a unique perspective on college life and is optimistic with the message that people will love you for who you are.</p><p>Landline</p><p>“Landline” is the story of an independent woman, Georgie McCool, who tries to have it all: a career and a family. Georgie, a successful comedy writer, gets a chance to write the show she’s always dreamed of writing, requiring her to skip out on the Christmas family holiday. This creates tension in her already strenuous relationship with her husband, Neal. When calling Neal from her old childhood room, Georgie reaches Neal from 10 years ago, early in their relationship. Through the phone calls, Rowell pieces together an intricate story of Georgie’s past, leaving the future in question as Georgie struggles to decide if Neal would be better off without her.</p><p>The paranormal aspect of “Landline” allows Georgie to follow through on the eternal human desire of going back in time, using what we know now to fix our past mistakes. The question raised through Georgie’s inner conflict, if love is enough in a relationship, forces readers to reevaluate the choices that they have made in their lives. “Landline” also does well with making a mature love story ridiculously cute. Georgie’s descriptions of Neal and his romantic gestures are sweet and moving: “Neal didn't take Georgie's breath away. Maybe the opposite. But that was okay—that was really good, actually, to be near someone who filled your lungs with air.” Exploring an older perspective than other Rowell books, “Landline” excels in making deep feelings warm and fuzzy and portraying the complicated but honest visual of a modern woman in an imperfect but real love story.</p><p>Eleanor and Park</p><p>Arguably Rowell’s most famous work, “Eleanor and Park” offers hope as two disconnected outcasts find each other, and themselves in the process. Eleanor is the new, immediately unpopular girl in town; bullied and from an abusive household, she buries herself in music and books. Park, quiet and with an overbearing father, mostly keeps to himself. Told from dual perspectives, “Eleanor and Park” slowly reveals how the two fall in love in a heartwarming story.</p><p>The character of Park strays from the typical, hyper-masculine love interest so often presented in young adult fiction. Instead, Park is a flawed but kind and brave person who enjoys comics and occasionally wears eyeliner. Park’s immigrant mother struck a chord with me because it’s so rare to see first-generation Americans shown in popular books. Throughout the book, Park struggles with his half-Korean identity. He learns to find solace in his mother, Mindy, who, because of her own status as an outsider, is able to understand what Park and Eleanor are going through.</p><p>“Eleanor and Park” is a passionate, memorable story because of how deeply emotional it is and how it encapsulates the teenage experience. For Eleanor and Park, life is messy and hard, the way being a teenager is. However, despite hardships, Eleanor and Park have such a strong and heartfelt bond, solidified through mixtapes and ‘80s lyrics, that in both the giddy and the heart-wrenching moments, a sense of hope underlies the book. It is the hope that you are worthy just because of who you are and that life, no matter how bad it seems, always gets better.</p>	Article	70	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

According to witnesses, the shocking exchange went something like this:</p><p>THOMAS: “Hello, Gilvir! How's it going?”</p><p>GILL: “Hey, Eugene!

Why is it so hot in September!?”</p><p>THOMAS: “Damn global warming!”</p><p>GILL: “Argh, yes, exactly!”</p><p>At this point, the pair was joined by one of Thomas’s friends, who was about to ask Thomas: “So, where do you plan on applying early?” only to be interrupted by the onset of a sneeze. Gill then raised his hand in a half-hearted attempt to convey that he was leaving and quickly strode ahead in euphoric joy, tightly clutching onto memories of the happily interrupted interaction.</p><p>“I have a deal with a publisher already to publish my memoir about the incredible occurrence,” Gill exclaimed.</p><p>This isolated event reminds us once more of the current epidemic of college-itis. “It’s awful,” senior Amy Ren vented. “Last week a freshman asked me what time it was, and I automatically replied ‘Harvard.’”</p><p>For many Jewish students, the recent holidays have meant a barrage of questions about college. “I was just trying to enjoy my apples and honey, but all these schmucks kept asking me when I was getting into Brandeis.

714	﻿To Eat Ramen in Peace  <p>Juxtaposed alongside nondescript warehouses and newly built luxury condos sits Ichiran Ramen, a haven for ramen-loving introverts. The renowned Japanese chain debuted its first U.S. location in Brooklyn’s Bushwick merely a year ago, but the bustling restaurant has garnered a popularity so large that it has begun to dominate ramen culture.</p><p>To step into Ichiran is to step into another world, with Japanese music in the background, a plethora of posters with Japanese writing on the wall, and a string of red lanterns dangling from the ceiling. Though Ichiran is a chain that has been around in Japan since the 1960s, there is a tangible vibrancy and uniqueness within its walls that does not appear manufactured.</p><p>The restaurant is split into two distinct compartments, one being standard table seating. The second compartment is what essentially drew Ichiran to its current state of fame and is where most request to dine; it’s a procession of “concentration” booths that allow people to eat in isolation, with minimal to no contact with the restaurant waiters.</p><p>I am seated at a concentration booth on a stool with wooden dividers on either side of me. In front of me, thin bamboo shades cover a wide slit in the wall. Hands of anonymous waiters then lift the shade to slide an ordering form towards me, enabling me to customize my own bowl of ramen, detailing the amount of seasoning and the firmness of the noodles.</p><p>After I’ve filled it out, the same hands reappear from behind the shades to collect the forms. It is roughly a 20-minute wait for the food to come. In that time, I am free to read the signs and posters above my head, which detail the concept of these concentration booths: their purpose, they state, is to provide all customers with the personal freedom of having an intimate experience with their ramen and minimal distraction.</p><p>After 20 minutes, the bamboo shades are lifted, and the noodles arrive in an oriental bowl with a soup spoon and chopsticks. On a culinary level, it is simple yet visually stunning. Scallions are presented on the left side of the bowl, a dollop of red spicy seasoning is placed on top of the bed of noodles in the center, and char-siu slices are placed on the right, all of which float in a steaming pork-based broth.</p><p>The ramen is rich and savory, teeming with umami flavor. Instructions on the plaque above my head tell me that in order to experience their ramen “the Ichiran way,” I should “carefully slurp three or four spoonfuls from the side of the bowl [and] then gradually incorporate the other toppings.” The scallions, char-siu, and Hidan no Tare (red spicy sauce) provide layers of brilliant flavor, adding to the underlying intense flavor from the broth.</p><p>Among many, one innovative facet of Ichiran is the kae-dama system, or noodle refill. Should I desire a refill of noodles, I can easily press a call button that prompts the waiter to bring the kae-dama.</p><p>Ichiran sells only a few other things in addition to their Tonkotsu ramen: their matcha drink, various Japanese beers, and matcha-almond pudding. The ramen comes at a minimum price of $18.90, and though it may be pricier than the average Stuy student’s budget for ramen, it is ultimately worth the price, as their dining experience rivals that of any other ramen restaurant.</p><p>Ichiran reassures us that it is neither unusual nor disconcerting to have the desire to eat alone in a public setting. We are given a moment to ourselves and a room to be fully present with the food in front of us. For the people who may be hesitant to try Ichiran with the fear of eating alone in public, they can provide more than a good bowl of ramen—perhaps an opportunity to momentarily reconcile with ourselves in our fast-paced lives as Stuyvesant students. Innovative in its ability to allow us to truly pause and appreciate food, Ichiran invents itself as an emblem of culinary mindfulness.</p>	Article	71	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

The cause of death is still undetermined, but neighbors of Polazzo claim it was “utterly traumatizing” and that they “never saw something like this coming.” Local authorities are interrogating a series of razors, but the deceased beard has yet to be found.</p><p>Students have been seen in tears throughout the school, especially on the second floor as the smooth-skinned Polazzo strides through the halls. “It’s only been a few years, but I feel like I’ve lost a lifelong friend,” said teary-eyed senior Abie Rohrig.</p><p>This tragedy has also caused a huge problem for programming, as too many students have dropped Western Political Thought. Meanwhile, Oceanography course requests are at an all-time high, as students praise the beard of biology teacher Stephen McClellan.</p><p>“We truly lost something great today,” Principal Eric Contreras said. “The beard was right up there with those of Lincoln, Marx, and Christ; it’ll be a long time before we see another like it.” Contreras also remarked that the school would have to get by for a little while with “whatever [physical education teacher Vincent] Miller’s excuse for facial hair is.”</p>	Article	73	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
716	﻿A Terrorist Attack Happened in Vegas The Las Vegas attack meets a broadened scope of terrorism as it meets the textual definition of terrorism and used human lives as a means to an end; it is important to term it a terrorist attack for governmental intervention and societal condemnation. <p>“The act of terror then is the quantifiable use of human lives with the purpose of establishing fear.”</p><p>For an impossibly long ten minutes, bullets rained down over the heads of the 22,000 people attending the packed Route 91 country music festival in Las Vegas. Bewildered concert-goers initially thought that the bullets were pyrotechnics. From the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort, Stephen Paddock used dozens of modified firearms to shoot down on masses of innocent concert-goers, killing at least 58 and injuring over 500. By the end, it was the worst mass shooting in modern American history.</p><p>It is clear that this was a premeditated terrorist attack. Paddock deviously booked multiple hotel rooms throughout the Las Vegas area next to other high-attendance concerts. US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives agent Jill Snyder revealed that Paddock had purchased 33 assault weapons in the past year alone, and Clark County sheriff Joseph Lombardo indicated that Paddock had an escape plan as well. Cameras were arranged throughout his hotel room, and a getaway car replete with explosives and additional ammunition was set up. Furthermore, tens of thousands of dollars in overseas transactions and gambling all within weeks of the attack raised suspicious red flags.</p><p>Paddock senselessly attacked innocent civilians, meeting the textual meaning of terrorism. The overwhelming fear and panic was captured by the videos of concert-goers. Human lives became the means to an end.</p><p>In terrorism, the human lives lost become a quantifiable objective, a symbol for the progress toward violent and delusional motives. Paddock clearly demonstrated this; he did not attack particular individuals, but rather sought to kill scores of individuals—the greater the number, the better.</p><p>That being said, the official definition of terrorist attacks by the government is set by the US Department of State, which has a comprehensive list of Foreign Terror Organizations that consists of groups that have committed or have a clear intent for orchestrating a terrorist attack; key within its parameters, however, is “foreign.” A domestic terror charge does exist and it allows for the in-depth surveillance of groups associated with attacks, but it is not a criminal charge.</p><p>Because of the “foreign” label, domestic groups such as the Ku Klux Klan are conspicuously missing from the list of terrorist groups. Despite committing terrorizing atrocities throughout American history, these groups have maintained that they hold First Amendment rights and therefore cannot be classified by the government as a terror group subject to special scrutiny.</p><p>An example is Timothy McVeigh’s 1995 Oklahoma City bombing of a federal government building, which killed 168 and injured over 680. It had a clear and evidenced political motive in attempting to punish the US federal government. And yet, despite the terroristic characteristics of both the motive and the fulfillment, McVeigh’s attack was not charged under terrorism.</p><p>More recently, the Charlottesville incident that involved the ramming of a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one, was even explicitly called an act of “domestic terrorism” by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The assailant had made neo-Nazi political objectives as a high schooler, and the Unite the Right rally that he was a part of during the attack was spearheaded by various alt-right groups, including former KKK Imperial Wizard David Duke. Yet, no charge of terrorism was brought up.</p><p>Classifying these domestic incidents as terrorist attacks holds important consequences. Terrorism creates vast avenues for federal authority and special attention, which have successfully quashed foreign terror threats through drone attacks and covert military take-outs. Even the domestic terrorism charge allows terrorist attacks to become linked to groups and movements and grants the government wide leverage to dissolve them.</p><p>Even “lone wolf” attacks often have accomplices and a deeper net of sympathizers; for example, McVeigh had learned how to weaponize explosive trucks through other anti-government conspiracists. Paddock’s getaway car and his ability to acquire and transport his arsenal of weapons suggests the presence of accomplices. And much like with foreign terrorist groups, government watch lists and surveillance highlight suspected domestic terrorists before they can do harm. Had Paddock been profiled, his build-up of firearms over the past year would have likely placed him on a watch list.</p><p>Though at this point it appears that Paddock did not have a politically-charged motive, it is important to note that terrorism in the modern world does not necessarily need to have a political dimension. An act of terror ought to refer to the act itself, much like how a murder is a murder and is prosecuted justly, regardless of whether it was a political assassination or a domestic violence case.</p><p>The act of terror, then, is the quantifiable use of human lives with the purpose of establishing fear. According to a 2016 CNN poll, over three-quarters of Americans fear a “lone-wolf” terrorism attack more than they do an attack from a foreign terrorist group. Labelling domestic “lone-wolf” attacks as terrorism is important to accurately reflect the fear associated. The great fear of terrorist attacks such as 9/11 has created symbols of terrorism in our mindsets, symbols that have driven us to the lengthiest war in American history; these symbolic connections need to be extrapolated to domestic terrorist attacks to have us adequately condemn them. Though thoughts and prayers are necessary for the victims and families of victims, action needs to be taken—labelling the attack as terrorism raises the stakes.</p>	Article	63	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
717	﻿What has “Indie” Become? “I like him, but he tries to be indie when really he’s just findie.” As my friend said this, I looked at her in disbelief.... <p>“I like him, but he tries to be indie when really he’s just findie.” As my friend said this, I looked at her in disbelief. I had never used the word indie to describe something other than music, much less “findie.” When I further questioned my friend, Nora Grabcheski, a sophomore at Montclair High School in New Jersey, she described the word as, “Findie: fake indie. You know, the kids that wear indie clothes and listen to indie music but they’re just doing it because everyone in their friend group does it. Findie.”</p><p>Before a person can create a “fake” version of a word, they must know what the original word means. So what does indie even mean? It is a shorthand word for “independent,” referring to independent artists or producers without a budget or big production crew. These productions were stereotyped as being things that not everyone understood, such as abstract films or songs with raspy vocals and a ukelele stringing together slow notes.</p><p>Since then, indie culture has become mainstream. Now that technology is incredibly easy for most people to get their hands on and apps like SoundCloud and iMovie have allowed everyone to produce media independently, the meaning has changed. People who produce music through Garageband and upload it to SoundCloud can still be considered indie musicians, but along with music, they’ve seemed to create an entirely new culture that not only ties in music and films but fashion style and even a way of life.</p><p>As I’ve seen from living in New York City, people who consider themselves indie generally dress and act a certain way. These are the same people who somehow know all the obscure new bands or go to Greenwich Village on a Friday night to watch a student film production. Though indie simply means “independent,” I have noticed a certain style attributed to being indie.</p><p>Grabcheski described an outfit she would think of as being indie: “You gotta have some of your worn, loose-fitting green jeans, and then if you’re a girl, you wear no bra with some basic gray shirt or crazy thrift store shirt. Then maybe some Tevas or even some grunge boots, and you gotta carry your mini [...] Jansport. And of course, you can’t forget accesories. I would picture some funky, big, dangly earrings and a nose piercing.”</p><p>As I thought about how she described this style, I realized I had been noticing these trends around New York City and in the hallways of Stuyvesant, especially in the past few months. I have also heard a lot more talk about newer, but less “pop,” musicians, with people spreading their personal musical style by posting on their Instagram stories whatever song they’re currently listening to or going to hip warehouses and hole-in-the-wall cafes to see indie bands.</p><p>Indie style can be unique but mainstream at the same time. Though people still see trends such as baggy jeans or a nose piercing and wear them, it seems teenagers are finding ways to put their own personal twists on their outfits. Maybe they add a shirt they found while sifting through a thrift store or earrings from a stand on West 4th Street. Indie has always meant independent, and teens today are staying true to that.</p><p>In a society where Instagram and other social media platforms dictate which trends are acceptable, indie style breaks away from this confinement. Though there is a vague template for the indie style, it isn’t as defined as styles such as goth or hippie.</p><p>Indie culture is spreading, and it’s only getting more popular. Apps like Spotify allow indie bands from all over the world to be heard by listeners from other countries. Even on Netflix, there is an “Independent” section, which contains many foreign films. Expect to see a lot more of the style this year, whether it be in class at Stuyvesant or on the subway ride home. This style doesn’t seem to be losing followers anytime soon.</p>	Article	68	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

719	Lavar and the Ball Family’s Rise to Fame Lavar’s antics are genius from a marketing standpoint. <p>Over the past year, LaVar Ball has become a household name in American sports. Through his outlandish statements, he has become the most famous father in the sports world. This newfound fame has trickled down to his son Lonzo Ball, who has made headlines without playing a minute in the NBA yet, and his younger brothers LaMelo Ball and LiAngelo Ball, who are in high school and college respectively. The Ball family even has a reality show on Facebook called “Ball in the Family.” Without LaVar’s presence in the media, the Ball family brand would not have become this prominent.</p><p>To have a big brand, an athlete must excel in the sport but also have a charismatic personality. San Antonio Spurs small forward Kawhi Leonard may be widely regarded by fans as one of the elite players in the league; however, his quiet demeanor on and off the court hasn’t helped him grow his brand. Los Angeles Clippers power forward Blake Griffin, on the other hand, has many commercial deals because of his high-flying dunks and marketability, even if he isn’t as talented as Leonard on the court.</p><p>LaVar’s antics have proven to be successful in growing his company. He has said that he could beat Michael Jordan one-on-one. He has claimed that Lonzo is better than two-time league MVP, Stephen Curry. He came out with a $500 shoe for Lonzo, the ZO2, saying that the shoes are only meant for “big ballers.” Every time LaVar does something controversial, Big Baller Brand gets more attention. The NBA media loves controversy, such as with the Kevin Durant-Russell Westbrook feud last season after Durant left Oklahoma City, and recently with the Kyrie-LeBron drama. LaVar is more than a troll; he is a shrewd businessman. When he goes on First Take on ESPN, he knows that he is getting free advertisement. The shouting matches between him and host Stephen A. Smith bring attention and press which lead to more people finding out about Big Baller Brand.</p><p>"A brand is one of the biggest things you can have," LaVar said in an interview with USA Today. "It's a hard thing to attain, so nobody wants to attain it and not too many people think that far ahead.” It seems like LaVar’s marketing has gone according to plan so far. The Lakers are going to be on national TV a lot this year, and season tickets have sold out already. Lonzo Ball may be the most hyped rookie since Lebron James in 2003.</p><p>Many argue that Lonzo should speak for himself, but he is usually blunt and nonchalant on and off the court, so LaVar is taking matters into his own hands. Without LaVar’s bold statements, Lonzo would be just be another promising young rookie. Lonzo was great in college, but his numbers of 14.6 points, 7.6 assists, and 6.0 rebounds per game alone would not have brought on anywhere near the amount of attention he has garnered. LaVar may be obnoxious, but it is hard to fault a man for trying to find success for his family.</p>	Article	75	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
720	Where Statistics Meet Football: The Fourth Down Dilemma  <p>New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick made what was, to many, a “bad” call on November 15, 2009. On the fourth down, with two yards to go from his own 28 yard line and 2:08 left on the clock, the Patriots were leading the Indianapolis Colts 34-28 and Belichick elected to go for it. The attempt failed and the Colts scored just three plays later to steal the win in dramatic fashion, with Belichick being blamed entirely for letting a game that was all but won slip away.</p><p>Historically, Belichick’s decision seems to be radical and out of place. However, with the emergence of new analytics and data science in the world of sports, we can reexamine this decision from a far more informed perspective, as I did at the Wharton Moneyball Academy, a sports analytics program for high school students. For now, sports analytics have not had nearly the same impact on football as on other sports like baseball. This is largely due to the nature of the sport. Unlike baseball, every football play involves contributions from multiple players from the same team. Thus, most statistics are representative of more than one player’s actions, making it hard to isolate and evaluate player performance. However, the fourth down dilemma is a rare area where statistical analysis has produced a concrete conclusion: coaches should be far more aggressive on fourth down.</p><p>This idea has yet to have real game impact due to resistance from NFL coaches. However, initial resistance has been common in most sports, even statistics oriented ones like baseball, and may subside as time passes and sports analysis technology improves. Former Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher was quoted saying, “It's easy to sit there and apply a formula, but it's not always the easiest thing to do on a Sunday. There's so much more involved with the game than just sitting there, looking at the numbers, and saying, 'OK, these are my percentages, then I'm going to do it this way,' because that one time it doesn't work could cost your team a football game, and that's the thing a head coach has to live with, not the professor.” However, what coaches like Cowher do not realize is that their ignorance and resistance toward the hard facts may end up costing them points, and even games.</p><p>With several respected data analysts at Wharton, I studied in depth the simple question: What should coaches do on the fourth down? It is conventional for coaches to punt the ball on fourth down from most positions on the field. It’s a somewhat risk-free play, but studies suggest that it may be better to go for it in many situations. The majority of these studies revolve around the concept of net expected points. They examine how many points teams are likely to score or allow based on their decisions on fourth down situations. These expected points numbers are calculated by multiplying the probability of one outcome by the amount of points lost or gained and adding that number to the product of the probability of the alternative outcome and the points lost or gained. This analysis takes into account factors such as fourth down conversion percentage based on field position and the number of yards left to go for a first down, as well as field goal percentage, average punt distance, and scoring percentage by field position. Looking ahead one or more drives, they do this analysis for every possible decision—punt, kick a field goal, or go for it—and with that data, extract the greatest net expected points. Whatever decision that number corresponds with is deemed optimal.</p><p>So, let’s get back to Belichick's controversial decision. The fourth and two at his own 28 yard line situation that Belichick found himself in is actually one of the three possible situations in which punting and going for it are equally effective according to the expected points model. Consequently, we must take factors such as time and score into account in order to reach a more concrete conclusion.</p><p>According to the New York Times, because it was fourth and two, the Patriots had a 60 percent chance of converting the fourth down. Given that a first down would have effectively won the game, you can start your win probability calculation by multiplying .60 by 1. Next, you must multiply the chance that they would not have converted, 40 percent, by the chance that even if they had turned the ball over on downs, the opposing team would have failed to score and the game would have been won in spite of the failed conversion. Historically, with two minutes left on the clock from the opposing team’s 28 yard line and a touchdown needed to win or tie the game, NFL teams score 53 percent of the time. Therefore, you multiply .40 by .47 and add the product to the .60 that was calculated previously. The result shows that going for it on fourth down in that situation gave Belichick and the Patriots a 79 percent chance of winning the game.</p><p>Alternatively, when teams punt from their own 28 yard line, the average punt nets 38 yards. This means that the opposing team, on average, would start their drive on their own 34 yard line. The chance of scoring from a team’s own 34 yard line in this situation is approximately 30 percent, giving the Patriots a 70 percent chance of winning if they had punted the ball.</p><p>Evidently, going for it on that fourth down gave the Patriots the best chance of winning, which means Belichick made the right call. He’s somewhat of a maverick in his departure from the conservative fourth down culture in the NFL and was met with intense criticism after the loss. But he made a statistically sound decision and maximized his team’s chance of winning the game. Ultimately, football fans, coaches, and critics alike may look back on this play in a different light as statistical analysis continues to become an increasingly important part of sports.</p>	Article	76	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
721	﻿Spartans On the Roll to Victory The Spartans came away with an easy 2 first wins, looking to sweep the division, and continue to bowl higher to be seeded higher in the playoffs with their strong team. <p>“We have the best overall team,” Stuyvesant Spartans coach Di Wu said. While this might seem like a pompous conjecture, considering the Spartans have won only their first two season games, they have good reason to be aiming high.</p><p>The Spartans, Stuyvesant’s boys’ bowling team, won their first game against the High School of Arts and Design at Astoria Bowl on September 29. The A and B teams both won their respective matches; the A team bowled a total of 579 pins, and the B team bowled a total of 538. Thus, the game was clinched best-of-three even before the C team took the floor. “It was a pretty normal game,” senior and co-captain Jihui Xue said. “We never lost to them last year, so it was an expected win.”</p><p>Senior and co-captain Yongfei Zheng and sophomore Samuel Fang stood out in their performances. Zheng bowled an incredible 180 for the A team, easily beating his PSAL average last year of 101. He had five total strikes; three consecutively from the fourth to sixth frames, and then three more in the ninth and 10th. “I have confidence in [Zheng in]setting the tone for others. He is consistent and brings the team’s spirits up,” coach Wu said. Zheng is one among the three juniors from last year’s B team who have stepped up to form the core group of the A team this year. Yongfei Zheng, Jihui Xue, and James Lee are co-captains and are all expected by coach Wu to bowl above a 160 average this season. He is one of the reasons Xue feels so optimistic about this season: “I feel like we’re a lot better than last year, and this time, we'll definitely go further in the playoffs,” Xue said.</p><p>“The real surprise was Samuel Fang from the B team,” coach Wu said. Fang, who didn’t even bowl as a starter last year, is now a rising star. “He practiced during the summer on his own, and had the highest score [187 pins] among the A and B team on [September] 29.” Samuel is expected to join junior teammate Lingpeng Chen to form next year’s core group.</p><p>The Spartans had their second victory against Beacon High School, again at Astoria Bowl, on October 5. Again, the game was taken by the A and B teams’ back-to-back wins. All members of the A team were solid and won by a total of 651-436. The B team won by a total of 525-412 and saw an incredible feat by senior Wesley Chen, who bowled a 189.</p><p>Looking forward, Coach Wu expects the Spartans to repeat their performance as division champs this season. However, the team’s goal is not just to win the division, but also to climb higher on the PSAL ranking. “PSAL ranks teams based upon the highest number of pins scored each game,” Wu said. “If we can score north of 170 pins, we will be ranked in the top 16 teams in the NYC.” The Spartans will then once again make it to the playoffs, but ideally as a higher seeded team. With the higher seeding, the next step would be to avoid the superior Staten Island teams early in the playoffs, perhaps playing them in the quarterfinals while hosting home games. “Though we’re good enough for our division, the whole team would have to improve collectively if we have any hopes of defeating the Staten Island teams,” Lee said.</p><p>Coach Wu has emphasized to his players the importance of closing frames (a strike or spare), as the following throw after a closed frame is added bonus points. “If all frames are closed, players can pretty much score a 200 in every game,” Wu said. Fang is a prime example of this. In the first game, Fang closed all his frames except in the tenth, which accounted for his high score of 182.</p><p>Composure and mentality are also vital, and coach Wu works to keep everyone’s temperature at a good level during game management. “All players have the capacity to bowl over 200, but they must stay confident and not get offset,” Wu said. “Players need to play their own game and not be affected by other players or their previous frames. In bowling, you compete against yourself. It's you and the pin. So 80, if not 90 percent is mental.”</p><p>“The strength is that the team is very close knit. Among them, there is friendly competition, and everyone drives each other forward,” Wu said. “We have the best overall team. Other teams may have a few good players, but we are the best, from top to down, one through eight. If other teams want to beat us, they have to beat us all.”</p>	Article	77	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
722	﻿Major Wins For Peglegs After Rocky Start The Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, maintains a winning streak, despite multiple match reschedulings and an initial loss. <p>Stuyvesant’s boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, is sustaining a four-match winning streak after its loss to long time rival, Martin Luther King Jr. High School, in their first game of the season. The Peglegs are currently tied for second place with Washington Irving High School in Manhattan’s A1 soccer league, an improvement from the third place standing that the Peglegs have held for the past two seasons.</p><p>In September, three of the Peglegs’ games were postponed due to high temperatures and unavailability of fields, a few out of the 27 other matches postponed throughout the city. This trend is likely to continue as the league directors struggle to find enough locations for the games.</p><p>The Peglegs came back strong however, with a 1-0 win against Julia Richman Education Complex High School on September 22. This was followed by a 3-0 win against Washington Irving High School five days later. The Peglegs continued their successes with a 2-1 win in their second match against Julia Richman this past Sunday.</p><p>The loss of their initial game motivated the Peglegs to change their tactics, optimistic for a different outcome against MLK in their match on Friday, October 6.</p><p>“The fact that we were able to compete with the reigning champions just showed us the potential of the team, and we haven’t lost since,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said.</p><p>Since then, the team has been working on dominating the ball and keeping the ball in play. This motivation has led to an increase in focus among players during practice while preparing for the rematch against MLK. “After the loss, we practiced possessing the ball, communicating and passing the ball out of the backfield,” coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>Junior Robert Nava has played a crucial role in the team’s recent success and is currently leading both the team and the division in goals, having scored eight out of the team’s nine total goals in its past five games. Sophomore Jeremy Moller scored the other goal for the Peglegs.</p><p>Other players have also been critical to the team. “Seniors Simon Carmody and Tymur Kholdynak have been aggressive players and true warriors on the field,” Miller said. Senior goalie David Power, with 36 saves in just five games, is the final barrier of the Peglegs.</p><p>“The team is doing really well this year,” Nava said. “Most of the goals I've scored so far have been from through balls or long balls over the defenders. I think if [we] continue to do what we're doing, then we'll have a good chance to make it far this year,” he said. As the season has progressed, the team has progressively increased its shots on the goal. In their first game, they shot four attempts at the goal and have shot 18 in some of their more recent matches, a statistic potentially pointing to future wins for the Peglegs.</p>	Article	79	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
723	﻿Conforming to and Subverting the Stereotype The Editorial Board analyzes the extent to which Stuyvesant students conform and subvert to its stereotypes. <p>“We’re so smart”</p><p>Conform:</p><p>It is true that the Stuyvesant population lives up to many of society’s typical markers of intelligence: Our standardized test scores are much higher than average and the colleges attend are generally highly selective.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, societal markers like these ignore the intricacy and diversity of intelligence represented at Stuyvesant. Not every Stuy student fits the mold of hard-working and academically high-achieving. Almost all of us have at least one weak subject and many of us don’t maintain a high average, or struggle on standardized tests. There are subjects and topics in which we flourish (though are sometimes undervalued, such as social or artistic intelligence), and subjects where we feel as though we don’t live up to Stuyvesant’s expectations.</p><p>Test-Oriented:</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Tests are known to be a big part of a Stuyvesant student’s life, but some go as far as to say we are defined by them. Of course, this is not a stereotype without merit; every day, the Dear Incoming Facebook groups are flooded with posts from students asking how to do well on so-and-so’s test and study guides shared by overachieving individuals. In fact, one of Stuyvesant’s biggest organizations, ARISTA, encourages its members to upload study guides for all students to use. This drive for doing well on tests is eminent throughout Stuyvesant culture.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, tests are far from defining Stuyvesant students. Boasting over 200 clubs and pubs and 32 varsity teams, Stuyvesant encourages students to participate in extracurriculars that range from the Photography Club to the cross country team. SING!, one of the events students are most passionate about, shows we can enjoy school without being consumed by exams.</p><p>Emotionless:</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Students may seem emotionless, as seen by the lack of school spirit and the sense that we don’t care for each other outside of our friend groups. If a physics test fell on the day after a homecoming game, most students would choose to stay home and study; in fact, even if there were no tests, most students still wouldn’t go.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Still, students are often empathetic and supportive, as shown through organizations like Big Sibs, where upperclassmen advise underclassmen, and the Dear Incoming Facebook groups, which are full of support and advice.</p><p>Cut-throat Environment</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Stuyvesant has gained a reputation as a cutthroat environment where students frequently aim to undermine each other to further their own academic success. While it may be true that almost all Stuyvesant students strive to academically achieve, this generalization ignores the fact that support can be found for all who seek it at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Class Facebook groups abound for students looking for guidance and homework help, and services such as ARISTA and the Writing Center offer further student-sponsored help. Students truly root for each other’s success and celebrate each other’s victories, as evidenced by the true sense of community following college acceptances.</p><p>STEM-y</p><p>Conform:</p><p>On the first day of school, it is not uncommon to hear stories of summers spent volunteering at hospitals, coding, or working at labs from fellow students. This emphasis on STEM has become a key aspect of Stuyvesant’s reputation and is confirmed not only by the rigorous STEM related courses Stuyvesant offers, but by students themselves. In fact, according to the recent freshmen survey conducted by the Spectator, 52.1 percent of freshman currently want to enter a STEM-related field.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, while in name Stuy might be regarded as a STEM-heavy school, in reality, the humanities play a just as important role in student life. One need only look at the English department, which is arguably the strongest at Stuy, to see the administration places a huge emphasis not just on STEM, but on creating well-rounded students. Even the students undermine this stereotype. From the intensity with which students commit to the arts during SING! to the fact that  the four largest organizations at Stuy, Speech and Debate, The Spectator, Big Sibs, and the SU, are humanities oriented, it is clear that while Stuyvesant does provide ample opportunities for STEM-oriented students, humanities are taken just as seriously.</p><p>Condescending</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Stuyvesant students are often proud that they are part of the top three percent of SHSAT takers. However, sometimes this pride manifests itself in the form of condescension. Stuyvesant students commonly joke about our next door neighbor, BMCC. On report card day, students can be heard lamenting that they’ll “only get into BMCC.” Students who gain admission to SUNY universities often denigrate their future school.</p><p>Unfortunately, this stereotype is largely true within the student body. However, we should keep in mind that the SHSAT was only one exam, and that we should avoid outwardly projecting our sense of superiority to students of other high schools and colleges.</p><p>“Everyone” is Depressed</p><p>Conform:</p><p>Stuyvesant students are overwhelmingly conscious of their mental health, often taking mental health days to relieve pressure. Several students have been hospitalized for emotional or mental instability, and some even transfer schools. The necessity of having extensive mental health support  (SPARK, a social worker, etc.) is evidence of our community’s ongoing battle with depression.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Despite this, it only takes a day at Stuyvesant to see that the average student finds something to love here. There is a distinction between stress and depression.</p><p>Just Another Quiet Asian</p><p>Conform</p><p>Everyone knows the “quiet Asian kid.” The one who takes the back seat in the classroom, shuffles in and out wordlessly, and ducks his or her head when the teacher looks for volunteers. When these students walk across the stage at graduation, their peers question whether they even attended Stuyvesant. There is a hint of truth in the notion that Asian students seem to be meek, quiet individuals who get lost in the crowd, otherwise known as the “quiet Asian” stereotype. Many traditional Asian families do choose to emphasize values of respect and quiet reflection, which, when translated into a school environment, tend to manifest themselves in observant, but quiet students.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>Yet attributing the stereotype to culture or upbringing alone is an incredibly parochial way of looking at Asian students. Look more closely at the 74 percent Asian population at Stuyvesant and you will see students actively subjugating the quiet Asian stereotype by pushing themselves to raise their hands, try out for the debate team, and apply for leadership positions. In this sense, the debilitating stereotype becomes a challenge that Asian students rise to meet and overcome. However, we should not devalue students who do “conform” to this stereotype. From the classroom where participation determines up to 20 percent of your grade, to a society that values who you know over what you know, the “quiet Asian kid” faces an uphill battle. At a school so predominantly Asian, we should be the first to take steps to not perpetuate this discrimination and acknowledge these students as valuable members of our community.</p><p>Cheaters</p><p>Conform:</p><p>The cheating scandal in 2012 sent a shockwave through not only the Stuyvesant community, but through New York City public schools as a whole. As a result, Stuyvesant has received a poor reputation when it comes to academic honesty, and this year’s senior survey doesn’t help that stigma, as 70.9 percent of the class of 2018 has admitted to participating in some form of academic dishonesty.</p><p>Subvert:</p><p>However, Stuy is not alone when it comes to this fact. Students throughout New York City public schools routinely cheat, but it’s the academic prestige of Stuyvesant that makes it a larger and more publicized issue. The rigorous curriculum and competitive atmosphere at Stuyvesant bring out the worst in many, but that doesn’t mean 70 percent of seniors, or the entire school, are defined by this.</p>	Article	65	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
724	ESPN Does Not Have a Liberal Bias, it Merely Respects Free Speech ESPN does not have a liberal bias, it merely respects free speech. <p>If I ever want to see highlights from a walk-off home run, a Hail Mary, or a buzzer beater, I know to turn to ESPN. The undisputed leader in sports television broadcasts an incredible amount of content every day from tennis tournaments to NASCAR races. Flamboyant personalities like Stephen A. Smith lock horn on First Take, while intricate NFL tactics are broken down on NFL Matchup. Simply put, it is a sports fan’s virvana that runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This makes the recent allegations of liberal partisanship against ESPN even more alarming. Sports are supposed to be the last refuge from the political conversation that has roiled households across the United States.</p><p>Nestled inside deeply democratic Bristol, Connecticut, allegations of liberal bias within ESPN make sense. It is owned by Disney, whose CEO is a Democrat. Jemele Hill, a prominent African-American host of SportsCenter, recently called Donald Trump a “white supremacist” on her private Twitter feed. A media firestorm soon ignited, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying Hill’s tweet was “a fireable offense.” Conservative outlets rallied to this cause, saying that Hill’s comments were wrong and offensive toward the President and the U.S. as a whole.</p><p>However, ESPN’s critics failed to recognize the basic rights Hill is entitled to as a private citizen. Free-speech laws in the Connecticut State Constitution say that a company cannot fire its employees for exercising their First Amendment rights. Moreover, Hill should be allowed to express her own views. She didn’t say anything about Trump or politics on air at all; this was merely her private Twitter feed.</p><p>As a counterpoint, conservative commentators have noted ESPN’s dismissal of Curt Schilling, who was fired for highly prejudiced comments about transgender people he made on social media. But Schilling’s comments crossed the line between opinion and bigotry. He posted an extremely offensive meme accompanied with a grotesque description of transgender people. If Jemele Hill started making comments like this, then ESPN would be right to fire her as well. This was not Schilling’s first run-in with politics and ESPN either: he compared Muslim extremists to Nazis and said Hillary Clinton should be buried under a jail for her e-mail usage.</p><p>Similarly, ESPN fired radio host Colin Cowherd for calling Dominicans dumb. These comments sparked widespread outrage for insulting a whole ethnicity and for demeaning the level of intellect required to play baseball.</p><p>ESPN does accept conservative commentators as well as liberal commentators. Just look at Will Cain: he’s an “arch-conservative,” as described by Wikipedia, and has been a contributor to E:60 and First Take. In an appearance in Real Time with Bill Maher, Cain denied the existence of climate change, saying people who believe in it are “intellectually dishonest.” This is an absurd comment, but it’s not discriminatory or harmful. As long as a person is not a blatant bigot like Curt Schilling, ESPN has consistently protected personal free speech.</p><p>Data supports ESPN’s claim that it does not have a liberal bias as well. In a research study conducted in May 2017, conservatives gave ESPN a score of 7.2 out of 10, while liberals gave ESPN a score of 7.0 out of 10. Conservatives and liberals alike both watch and care about sports. ESPN would be foolish as a business to alienate a major segment of their consumers, especially as the rate of cord-cutting increases in the United States.</p><p>Michael Jordan once said, “Republicans buy shoes too,” when asked to endorse a Democrat in a political campaign. He sold his shoes to everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. This rings true for ESPN as well: they are the Worldwide Leader in Sports, not a political organization, and they do not pretend to be one either. It makes sense for ESPN business-wise to limit political speech as much as possible if such speech turns away viewers. Yet ESPN has also protected the free speech rights of its employees to the best of its abilities, even if it was not advantageous to do so. The balance between principles and profit is tough, but ESPN has handled this well despite being used as a conservative bogeyman for political correctness.</p>	Article	82	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
725	Way Too Early NBA Award Predictions Super-team or not, every organization is going to be gunning for the championship trophy, and every player is going to be eyeing these awards. <p>This off-season was one of the most exciting in history as multiple big-name players were shuffled around. We saw the Minnesota Timberwolves add experienced players in Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague and the Oklahoma City Thunder get All-Stars Paul George and Carmelo Anthony for role players. The Cavs also got some steals by acquiring veteran Dwayne Wade and former MVP Derrick Rose as their backup point guard.</p><p>And of course, there was the blockbuster Kyrie Irving-Isaiah Thomas trade, and the Celtics have paired up Kyrie with Gordon Hayward. There were countless players switching jerseys as more and more teams are trying to build super-teams like the Golden State Warriors have. Super-team or not, every organization is going to be gunning for the championship trophy, and every player is going to be eyeing these awards.</p><p>Most Valuable Player: Kawhi Leonard</p><p>Kawhi Leonard has proven himself to be a superstar, keeping the San Antonio Spurs a contender year in and year out. Averaging 25.5 points and almost two steals, he showed himself as a force to be reckoned with on both sides of the court and helped the Spurs get the second seed last season. With no other superstars on the team, he will have free reign much like Westbrook did last season, and because the Spurs will rely on him heavily, he will win MVP.</p><p>Rookie of the Year: Dennis Smith Jr.</p><p>Dennis Smith Jr. has an immense amount of natural talent with his explosive driving and finishing ability that I would compare to Westbrook’s. He also has a decent shot at 36 percent from the three-point range. He displayed his skills by averaging 18 points in the Atlantic Coast Conference and being named ACC Freshman of the year in his one year at NC State. But the biggest advantage he has over his competitors, like favorites Lonzo Ball and Jayson Tatum, is that he is playing on a team without any young talent to carry the team forward. Instead, the Mavericks have seasoned veterans like JJ Barea and Dirk Nowitzki that can help him improve his game. He is a dark horse, but he has enough talent and will receive enough playing time to win the ROTY race.</p><p>Most Improved Player: Myles Turner</p><p>Though the Indiana Pacers might lose more games this season than last year, Myles Turner will have a chance to improve his stats. He averaged 14.5 points on 51 percent shooting on a team with Paul George. He has a nice jumper and can play the pick and roll well, so with George gone, he can flourish on a team where he is the primary offensive option. All of his numbers will go up, giving him a chance to steal the MIP award from some of the bigger names.</p><p>Sixth Man of the Year: Derrick Rose</p><p>Yes, I think that the former MVP will be the best bench player in the NBA. It is safe to assume that Rose will become the backup point guard as soon as Isaiah Thomas is healthy, who has a hip injury and is likely to return by December. A seasoned player who was MVP not too long ago and averaged a respectable 18 points and four assists on a dysfunctional Knicks organization is sure to produce efficiently for the Cavaliers. He is, hands down, the best bench player in the league and will prove that this upcoming season.</p><p>Defensive Player of the Year: Draymond Green</p><p>Green is one of the essential pieces of the Warriors. His most important asset is that he can run the floor and guard all five positions as a big man and does it with a force that can even be over the top sometimes. He averaged 2.0 steals and 1.4 blocks last season and was first in Defensive box Plus-Minus and second in defensive win-shares. He is more well-rounded than his competitors and will bring the same intensity he brings every year.</p><p>Coach of the Year: Gregg Popovich</p><p>Coach “Pop” is one of the greatest coaches of all-time, with a streak of 20 consecutive winning seasons. He creates a great locker room environment for his players and runs a spaced out offense that gets every player involved. This type of offense led the San Antonio Spurs to 61 wins, clinching the second seed in the West with only one All Star on his team. He has a defense-first mindset that had the Spurs ranking third in defense last year. This year, his team has added Rudy Gay and still has veterans like Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Pau Gasol. His emphasis on defense with a solid offensive core will help the Spurs win and help Gregg Popovich claim Coach of the Year.</p>	Article	85	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
726	﻿Golden Gate Tides: The Rise and Fall of Colin Kaepernick Despite success early in his career and tantalizing physical talent, quarterback Colin Kaepernick is still unsigned. <p>Before he took a knee, before he was benched, and way before he led the San Francisco 49ers on an improbable Super Bowl run in 2013, I had already gotten acquainted with the strong, scrappy quarterback who was Colin Kaepernick.</p><p>I first became acquainted with Kaepernick’s play in 2010, when I had the privilege of watching him make mincemeat of Kellen Moore’s Boise State Broncos during an improbable November comeback.</p><p>Though I never had an eye for evaluating talent, especially at the age of ten, there was still something about Kaepernick’s game that made me think, “Hey, this guy can play.”</p><p>Among the jungle of marginal quarterback play that is college football, Kaepernick stood out. Standing at 6’4 with a live arm and the speed of a wide receiver, Kaepernick was rightfully drafted high by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2011 National Football League (NFL) Draft.</p><p>The 49ers had an established quarterback in Alex Smith, but it was obvious that the team needed a breath of fresh air from Smith’s monotonous, uninspiring style of careful play.</p><p>With a frightening defense that featured linebackers Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman both in their prime, they needed a more explosive option to lead their offense over the hump; Kaepernick was their man.</p><p>However, since his two playoff runs, Kaepernick’s career has taken an unfortunate turn for the worse after his past two seasons, which have been all but disappointing.</p><p>No collapse happens overnight. Rather, the seeds for disaster are sown years in advance, and everything bubbles below the surface before coming to fruition. For over a year, there had been a power struggle between head coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Trent Baalke that finally boiled over when Harbaugh was forced out in favor of organization favorite Jim Tomsula. Under the new regime, Kaepernick struggled immediately, posting an ugly four-interception performance during the Week 3 matchup against the Arizona Cardinals.</p><p>However, not all the problems were with Tomsula’s incompetent coaching. The death knell to Kaepernick’s dominance came as a result of shifting offensive and defensive schemes. For his three years of success with Harbaugh, Kaepernick had become a master of the read-option running scheme, an offense only previously known at the college level until Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, and Robert Griffin III of the Washington Redskins all made it popular in 2012.</p><p>However, 2015 was a different time. It had been three years now, and the read option offense was but a relic, with quarterbacks forced to adapt (like Wilson) or fail (like Griffin). In Kaepernick’s case, he still had the tools to succeed, but the rapid culture shift from Harbaugh to Tomsula likely stunted his growth as a pocket passer.</p><p>As a result, he was hung out to dry in what became a disastrous 2015 season, and culminated in a disgraceful benching for Jacksonville Jaguars’ castoff Blaine Gabbert. Kaepernick eventually won the job back, and he actually played soundly in Kelly’s ball control, tempo offense. However, in the end, he left the 2016 season, and the 49ers, with more questions than answers. His play was only adequate at best, and, beyond the questionable play, character concerns had also been piling up ever since Harbaugh’s departure.</p><p>After catching fire from teammate NaVorro Bowman for posting a picture of himself in a Miami Dolphins hat online in the offseason after the 2014 season, he seemed to lose the trust of his locker room.</p><p>Then, the biggest uproar came before the 2016 season, when Kaepernick decided to make a political statement. In light of recent police brutality, Kaepernick openly professed support for movements like Black Lives Matter, and then he truly stirred up controversy by refusing to stand during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner before games, a move that many conservative voices saw as disrespectful.</p><p>However, the last straw came as Kaepernick seemed to profess support for the late former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and actually wore a shirt with his image, a move that many saw as insensitive.</p><p>Now, for Kaepernick, the future looks cloudy. Though he opted out of his contract and into free agency, the free agency period is two months in and Kaepernick is still unsigned, leading some to get suspicious. Early in the free agency period, the NFL has seen a number of inferior quarterbacks earn rich contracts, from veterans like Josh McCown to spunky youngsters like Geno Smith. With Kaepernick still on the market despite having the best resume, talk has started that Kaepernick has been “blackballed” by the league, with reasons ranging from his play to his politics and even going as far as race.</p><p>In all likelihood, however, that is far from the truth. The fact is that Kaepernick is not the only talented player that stayed on the market for a long time. Adrian Peterson and LeGarrette Blount are both powerful, accomplished running backs with some time ahead of them, with the former ranking among the best in the league before injuries, age, and a suspension derailed his tenure with the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p>To say that any of these players have been “blackballed” is ridiculous, since they have both performed adequately of late. The problem is simply lack of demand at the price that Blount, Peterson, and Kaepernick are likely asking at. Kaepernick, Blount, and Peterson have been starters for most of their careers, and have likely been looking for starting positions along with “starter money.”</p><p>For Kaepernick, the situation is similar. At 29 years old, and with a more limited skill set than fellow free agent quarterbacks like Tony Romo, Kaepernick is an unfortunate “tweener” when it comes to his role. Though he would win a starting job on numerous teams, including the Rams, Browns, and Jaguars, all three of these teams have younger developmental options at the position.</p><p>On the flipside, many other teams have established veteran starters that would relegate Kaepernick to a strict backup role. Having been a starter for his entire career, it is unlikely that Kaepernick is simply willing to resign to a year on the bench quite yet. However, with most starting roles already filled, the chance of Kaepernick getting a starting offer is very slim. So, he waits.</p><p>As for Kaepernick’s off-field concerns, while defending a brutal dictator is insensitive, it pales in comparison with the literal rap sheets of other free agents, past and present, ranging from Greg Hardy to Ray McDonald to even the aforementioned Adrian Peterson. All three of these free agents have been signed to a free agent contract at one point or another, despite crimes as severe as child and domestic abuse. So, to call Kaepernick unsignable is unfair.</p><p>Even the argument that a backup quarterback cannot be a “distraction” is unfair, as there are numerous controversial backups in the NFL right now. Seattle Seahawks’ backup quarterback Trevone Boykin, for instance, is still on the roster despite multiple offseason arrests and frequent media attention, and is nowhere near the player that Kaepernick is. At the end of the day, this should just be perceived as a financial dispute, as anything more would be hypocritical and irrational by front offices.</p>	Article	193	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
727	﻿Blast From the Past: 2016 Costumes A spread on the previously done costumes last year. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Every year on Stuyloween, students pull their weird selves out from the huge piles of homework they were buried under and dress up to celebrate the Halloween spirit. Here are some notable costumes from last year.</p><p>Stranger Things</p><p>Senior Daniel Knopf as Will</p><p>Senior Michela Marchini as Eleven</p><p>“[Senior Michela Marchini] just called me one day and was like, ‘Hey, we should do Stranger Things for Halloween,’” senior Daniel Knopf smiled as he recalled last year’s Stuyloween when his girlfriend told him that they should dress up as Will and Eleven from Stranger Things.</p><p>The couple was really into the hit Netflix series at the time. They originally wanted to do the whole cast with their friends, but everyone else bailed. As a result, the costumes ended up being a couple’s look.</p><p>Knopf and Marchini went on a shopping adventure together to make their costumes.  “I did a lot of Amazon shopping with my mom and thrift shopping with Daniel for the costumes,” Marchini said. “We bought all the pieces separately and tried to piece them all together.”</p><p>Though the costumes were pieced together, Marchini and Knopf did their best to imitate the ‘80s look. Marchini even went as far as drawing Eleven’s nosebleed and brought in an Eggo pancake box. Her mom, who is rather artistically talented, helped in the making of some of the props in the costumes, like the radio Knopf was holding.</p><p>The couple received a lot of compliments from their friends and even random people on the street.         Last year was the first year Marchini and Knopf dressed up together, since they started dating a month after Halloween the previous year.</p><p>Up</p><p>Junior Taylor Choi as Russell</p><p>Junior Maryann Foley as Carl Fredricksen</p><p>Dressing up for Halloween has always been a tradition for junior Taylor Choi and junior Maryann Foley. They chose Up. Both of them are fans of Disney, and they were looking for an iconic duo to dress up as, so the characters of the heartwarming movie, Up, seemed perfect.</p><p>Though this was the first time Choi made her own costume, she expressed that though the process was a bit time consuming, it did not require much skill. She spent about two hours making the sash out of brown felt she got from Michaels the night before Stuyloween. It was a tedious process because she had to print and cut out 20 different badges and glue them on the sash individually.</p><p>Foley went through a similar process as Choi. However, unlike Choi, Foley actually had experience making her own costumes. As for last year’s costume, she just used clothes from her closet, with the exception of the bowtie, which she borrowed from a friend. To imitate the grape soda pin Mr. Fredricksen has in the movie, she painted an old bottle cap. Lastly, to construct the house, she simply cut balloon shapes out of construction paper and glued them to a cardboard. Foley even surprised Choi on the day of Stuyloween by bringing in a dog balloon, which represented the Golden Retriever, Dug, that Russell owns.</p><p>Yet, even with the “dog“ beside her, many people could not figure out which character Choi was dressed up as and mistook her as a girl scout. On the other hand, Foley’s costume was much more obvious. People recognized it immediately and liked it very much.</p><p>These compliments came at a cost. “There were just a lot of times that I had to awkwardly maneuver through crowds,” Foley said. “I once got stuck in a doorway because I forgot that I had the house on my back.”</p><p>Mermaid Man (from Spongebob)</p><p>Sophomore Ayham Alnasser</p><p>Despite his parents’ saying that Halloween is “Satan’s birthday,” sophomore Ayham Alnasser insists on dressing up for Halloween every year. Normally, he goes for the cheapest costume he can find at Rite Aid. However, last year, he decided to try something more out of his comfort zone.</p><p>“It was my freshman year, so I wanted to make a name for myself,” Alnasser explained. “So for the most comedic purpose, to get more kids to ‘vibe’ with me, and because Spongebob is overdone, I chose to be the Mermaid Man.”</p><p>Since he couldn’t find someone to be Barnacleboy, Alnasser went solo. He spent well over five hours stitching the costume himself. He pre-planned the costume in his head and used Youtube tutorials like “How to Sew” and “How to Choose Correct Materials.” Overall, it cost around 30 to 40 dollars.</p><p>Looking back to the day of Stuyloween, Alnasser revealed that he did not get much reaction from people, despite wearing a bright orange tight suit. Nonetheless, he did receive great reactions on his Facebook post online, where he discussed his costume.</p><p>Alnasser also participated in the annual Halloween costume contest that the Student Union hosts and won in the “Best Overall Costume” category. Not only did he manage to continue his tradition of dressing up for Halloween each year, but he also received a $15 Chipotle gift card.</p><p>Trump’s Wall</p><p>Junior Elisey Goland</p><p>When junior Elisey Goland walked into his chemistry class with a “Trump Make my Hair Great Again!” cardboard sign hanging on his neck, he received mixed reactions from people. “Some people thought I was promoting the wall and got mad. Others thought I was against the wall and got mad,” Goland explained. “But most people found it humorous.”</p><p>Though it was only a week from the election, making a political statement was never Goland’s intent. He just thought it would be fun to be the Wall.  “A friend of mine said he was going as Trump,” he said. “So naturally, I decided to be the Wall.”</p><p>He only spent around half an hour on his costume with supplies he bought from a local 99 cents store. Still, the “Wall” successfully showcased Goland’s satirical humor. Things like “Hola Trump” and “Made in China Trump Inc.” were written over the brick-red cardboard that he painted. To make it more realistic, Goland even drew cracks on it with a black marker.</p><p>Dressing up for Halloween is something Goland really enjoys doing with his friends. He came in as an error message, “costume not found,” and Bender from Futurama in previous years.</p>	Article	91	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
822	﻿Stuyvesant’s Second Annual Homeless Coalition Charity Run The Homeless Coalition, in partnership with the Wellness Council, held its second annual Homeless Coalition Charity Run on Friday, November 17. <p>Two hundred seventy students lined up outside Stuyvesant along the Hudson River to participate in the second annual Homeless Coalition Charity Run on Friday, November 17. The run was organized by the Stuyvesant Homeless Coalition and the Wellness Council and was sponsored by Clif Bar & Company. The event was in support of Back On My Feet, a non-profit organization that provides homeless people with resources.</p><p>The event is an important part of the Homeless Coalition’s strategy to encourage students to reach out to homeless people. “The run is really important because we were spreading homelessness awareness when the weather is starting to get colder and rates of homelessness are exponentially growing in NYC and nationally,” senior and president of the Stuyvesant Coalition Anna Pacheco said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>This was the first time that the Wellness Council worked with the Homeless Coalition to coordinate an event. “We joined the event because it’s a run, so it promotes wellness in the Stuy community,” junior and event department head of the Wellness Council Sophia Day said.</p><p>To advertize the run, the clubs convinced teachers to give extra credit to those who participated. “We contacted a lot of teachers to offer extra credit for the run. [Many] teachers also share the same belief that running is a great way to promote proper well-being, and that through running, a lot of their students would learn either something related to their field or just a healthy practice overall,” junior and president of the Wellness Council Jerry Ye said.</p><p>Students who wanted to participate were able to sign up beforehand and choose to run either one or two miles. The participants had to sign in before starting the run and sign out when they finished. The runners also received complimentary CLIF bars from the event organizers.</p><p>“The run was different from other years because there were way more people,” Pacheco said. “We had more goodies to give out thanks to [physical education teacher Peter] Bologna.”</p><p>Despite the turnout at the run, the event organizers fell short of their fundraising goal. The Homeless Coalition is passing out pamphlets to encourage students to keep donating to organizations that help the homeless. “We didn’t raise as much money as we wanted,” Pacheco said. “One of our members at the homeless coalition matched the money we did make, so we raised $300 in total.”</p><p>Students will have many more opportunities to support the Homeless Coalition and to contribute to their cause. The club will be holding a shoe drive and a book drive before the end of the year.</p>	Article	220	2017-11-30 09:16:20.650747	2017-11-30 09:16:20.650747
823	﻿Stuyvesant Celebrates Día de Los Muertos In Honor of 10/31 Victims The Spanish Department held a celebration for “Día de Los Muertos” on the fifth floor on Thursday, November 2. <p>Colorful decorations, delicious food, and festive music filled the fifth floor halls during the Foreign Language Department’s Día de Los Muertos celebration on Thursday, November 2. Día de Los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, is a Mexican holiday to celebrate ancestors and lost loved ones.</p><p>The event was put together by Spanish teacher Abigail Carpenter with help from the rest of the Spanish teachers. “Carpenter started this [last year], which we [hoped would] be a tradition. She is an excellent organizer,” Spanish teacher Frida Ambia said.</p><p>The students in Carpenter’s four classes were also instrumental. They helped create and set up the decorations for the celebration. In addition to the colorful skeletons and paper garlands covering the walls of the fifth floor, students made a traditional Mexican altar.</p><p>Traditionally, the altar is created in someone’s honor. After the terrorist attack on Tuesday, October 31, the students in Carpenter’s classes decided to dedicate the altar to those who passed away in the attack. “I thought the tribute was really sweet. I think it was really important that the victims were commemorated and really nice that the Spanish Department thought to do that,” freshman Jessica Kwok said.</p><p>Throughout the day and after school, many students came to see the decorated floor. “The highlight was definitely the fifth floor because it was so beautifully decorated. All the bright colors and decorations were just extraordinary and made each morning great,” junior Kathryn Jano said.</p><p>“[Carpenter] painted faces for the students, which I think most of the students really enjoyed,” Ambia said.</p><p>Spanish classes also held small celebrations in their classes on November 2. They went outside to look at the altar, and during class they listened to and sang Spanish music.</p><p>Some students also made pan de muerto, which roughly translates to “Dead Bread,” a traditional food that is eaten on Día de los Muertos. “In the classroom, it was extremely fun to learn about it, especially the traditions. The recipes [for the food] were also extremely fun to make,” Jano said.</p><p>Many students enjoyed the celebration and also learned more about the holiday. “I learned about how different cultures are able to appreciate and celebrate those who have passed away. Seeing how food is a major part of Día de Los Muertos was very interesting,” junior Francis Park said.</p><p>Carpenter thought that the event was a success, as well. “It was just fun, and not everyone understood why we did it or what for, but it was still really fun to see people participate and just have a really good time. That was a tough week after everything that happened on Tuesday, so to be able to just take our minds off it and relax, that was special. It was pretty and festive,” she said</p>	Article	221	2017-11-30 09:17:44.637333	2017-11-30 09:17:44.637333
824	﻿Corr and Schneiderman Elected Freshman Caucus Leaders Covering the Freshman Caucus campaign and election process of this year and interviewing the new Freshman Caucus President and Vice President <p>Katerina Corr and Jonathan Schneiderman were elected Freshman Caucus President and Vice President on Monday, November 6. The two new student body leaders received 112 votes, defeating their opponents, Eric Han and Noa Morris, who received 60 votes.</p><p>Corr and Schneider’s campaign focused on building on the work of previous freshman caucuses and offering solutions to existing issues. They advocated for a locker exchange program for freshmen who were dissatisfied with their locker placement, and for a more organized printing station. In addition, they hoped to implement policies that would allow cellphone usage in the hallways. “[We] tried to talk to as many people as we could [...] the campaign only promised things that we knew were possible,” Corr and Schneider’s campaign manager Talia Kahan said in an e-mail interview. “A lot of the other campaigns were promising things that were never going to happen [like] music in the halls, and this made them look a little bit less reliable.”</p><p>Corr and Schneider’s emphasis on creating a pragmatic platform may have swung the election in their favor. “I agreed with the policies of [Corr and Schneider’s] campaign because they could realistically be implemented and weren’t unnecessary or extravagant. [Corr and Schneider] promoted the change I wanted to see for the freshman class,” freshman Julian Giordano said.</p><p>Han and Morris’ platform had centered around giving students more opportunities to voice their opinions. One of the campaign’s main proposals was the expansion of homeroom representation in the caucus by designating a representative for each homeroom. Han and Morris also proposed a policy to allow students to review their teachers, but did not have a clear plan for implementation.</p><p>The campaign acknowledged that students may have misinterpreted their focus on new issues and new ideas.  “Our policies were among the most controversial aspects of the election [...] I [found that] most people [misunderstood] what we meant when we promised those as policies,” Han said in an e-mail interview. “We did not promise [that] they were going to happen. Our promise was that [we would] fight with all of the effort and passion that we could to implement them, because we believe they would best benefit the freshman class.”</p><p>Despite the heated exchanges between the supporters of both campaigns on social media, voter turnout for this year was significantly lower than last year. Compared to last year’s turnout of over 300, only 172 people voted in this election. “There's so much voter apathy and it's a problem that's been occurring for years at [Stuyvesant]. We try our best to encourage candidates to promote voting first and foremost before promoting their campaigns, because the truth of the matter is a lack of voting hurts the candidates the most,” Board of Elections co-chair Jennifer Lee said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Regardless of the low turnout, Corr and Schneiderman plan to focus on reform that will help them gain the confidence of the student body. “We aren't concerned with changing the school. We are here to make freshman year as great as possible for the class of '21,” Corr said.</p>	Article	222	2017-11-30 09:25:48.356059	2017-11-30 09:25:48.356059
728	﻿The Lady Lobsters Look To Close Out The Season With A Smash At the end of a rocky season, the Lady Lobsters are looking to finish out the season strong, going into playoffs. <p>As their season comes to a close, the Lady Lobsters, Stuyvesant girls’ tennis team, will attempt to finish strong after a couple of rocky games.</p><p>The Lady Lobsters’ season started with two shutout wins, winning 5-0 against both Eleanor Roosevelt High School and Hunter College High School. A full team effort allowed Stuyvesant to dominate its opponents, as each player pulled her weight and dismantled her opponents in the process.</p><p>As the season progressed, the team’s performance continued to improve. The Lady Lobsters won two of their next three games, 5-0 against the High School of American Studies and 4-1 against Eleanor Roosevelt, with its lone loss against Bronx Science, 4-1. This run was led by sophomore Alyssa Pustilnik, who has won 42 of the 50 total games she has played for the season, senior and captain Marie Ivantechenko, who had gone 27-12, and freshman Palak Srivastava, who went 40-18 in her doubles matches.</p><p>In their past three games, the Lady Lobsters have gone 1-2, with two 5-0 losses. In their first match against Beacon High School, none of the girls were able to win more than four games, but the Lady Lobsters were able to recover with another 5-0 win against Hunter College High School. Their latest game, an unfortunate 3-2 loss against Bronx Science, stopped any momentum that they were trying to gain to make a final run before the playoffs.</p><p>With only two games left in their season, the Lady Lobsters are looking forward to the playoffs. The Lobsters lost to Hunter College High School in the second round of the playoffs last season in a close 3-2 defeat, and this year, the Lady Lobsters are looking for revenge.</p><p>“We have a really strong lineup this year,” Ivantechenko said. “Hopefully, we’re going to get further in [the] playoffs than we have in recent years.”</p><p>With strong leaders and standout players, the Lady Lobsters are a well rounded team. However, their fate may be decided by their final two regular season games. Two losses would not be good going into the playoffs, as they would be 1-4 in their last five games. On the other hand, two wins would set them up with great momentum, as they would be enter the playoffs on a winning streak. Either way, the girls on the team will have to step up if they want to become PSAL champions.</p>	Article	78	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
729	﻿Penguins Under Pressure, Continue to Outswim Opponents Recounting the Penguins’ recent victories and analyzing the changes that have occurred this year and how they affect Stuyvesant’s chances at a championship run. <p>With the scoreboard already in Stuyvesant’s favor, junior Laura Saliy stepped up to her lane. She sprung off the starting block, jumping ahead of her competitors from her dive. By the time she finished her last lap, multiple swimmers from Hunter High School were two laps behind. Her win in the 500-yard freestyle was one of many from Stuyvesant’s girls’ swimming team, the Penguins, who have extended a streak of decisive victories with its 57-43 win over Hunter High School on October 4.</p><p>The Penguins have held a tight grip on the Bronx/Manhattan League for years. The last three seasons have seen a combined regular season record of 29-0 from the Penguins, a testament to their dominance in this division. Though their last championship came in the 2014-2015 season, every season since has featured deep playoff runs.</p><p>In fact, the Penguins’ frequent entrance into the playoffs has caused a rivalry to develop between them and the Brooklyn Tech Engineers. During the 2014-2015 season, the Penguins were able to triumph over the Engineers and win the city title, but last year, Brooklyn Tech retaliated and defeated Stuyvesant in the championship meet. Many of last year’s swimmers are eager to compete with the Engineers once again. “There are a lot of tough teams out there this year, including Townsend Harris, Bronx Science, Tottenville, Cardozo, and Brooklyn Tech. We especially look forward to possibly racing Brooklyn Tech again [as they] beat us at finals to take the championship title last season,” senior and co-captain Madeline Wong said.</p><p>While the Penguins will not face the Engineers this year in the regular season, they have a tense rivalry with another team in their division, the Bronx Science Wolverines. Many on the team were anxious about their meet with the Wolverines on October 6. “Going into the meet [against Bronx Science], we were a little nervous about not winning, but we swam incredibly and won. We out touched them in three events,” Wong said. Narrowly winning multiple events, the Penguins were still able to outscore the Wolverines 61-40 by claiming the top two places in many events, such as the 100-yard butterfly and the 50 and 100-yard freestyles.</p><p>This year, the Penguins hope to maintain their preeminence in the Bronx/Manhattan League and the PSAL as a whole. However, there is a lack of seniority on the team this year, with only five seniors and nine freshman. Despite this, the team is optimistic for the underclassmen, with many of the new Penguins impressing the captains. “We have awesome additions to our team, including sophomore Arielle Aney, who just broke 2:00 in her 200-yard freestyle during the recent meet against Bronx Science, and sophomore Emma Lee, who was MVP last year and made States in two individual events, the 50 free and the 100 free,” Wong said. Lee has already surpassed all expectations for this year, recording first place in all seven races she has competed in. This abundance of underclassmen talent will be something to note for the rest of the season.</p><p>Another point of emphasis this year for the Penguins was a coaching change in the offseason, with Ms. Silvana Choy becoming the head coach as former coach Peter Bologna became the new athletic director. Mr. Bologna, or Coach B, as he was colloquially referred to, coached both boys and girls swimming for countless years. He continues to pop up when meets are at Stuy, determined to help the teams however he can. Nonetheless, his replacement as coach was very unprecedented for the Penguins, with many finding it hard to imagine a coach for the swim team besides Coach B. “When we first found out Coach B wouldn't be our coach this year, we didn't know what to think. We couldn't imagine anyone except him coaching. However, Coach Choy quickly gained our love and respect. In the pool, she's really tough on us, but that's what makes us dedicated and fast swimmers. Outside of the pool, she's such a supportive and amazing person, and you can really tell she cares about all of us as people, not just swimmers,” Saliy said. Coach Choy has been very successful in her first month as coach, with the Penguins beating each team they’ve swam against by at least 10 points.</p><p>The Penguins are once again looking toward the postseason. The combination of a strong upperclassmen core, a rapidly developing underclassmen roster, and a new coach who has been highly effective early on makes a long playoff run highly feasible.</p>	Article	80	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
730	﻿Coach’s Corner: Meet Carl DiSarno, the Greyducks’ New Head Coach “I’ve tried to let the boys know that I can only take them so far. They have to take ownership of their training if they... <p>“I’ve tried to let the boys know that I can only take them so far. They have to take ownership of their training if they are going to get faster and if we are going to have success as a team.”—Carl DiSarno, coach</p><p>As they do each fall, the Greyducks are practicing hard and gearing up for their upcoming cross country meets, but with one notable difference. The boys’ cross country team has a new head coach: Carl DiSarno. DiSarno has replaced the now retired Mark Mendes, the Greyducks’ beloved coach who was the boys’ head cross country coach from 2000 until 2016. “Even though Coach Mendes left some pretty big shoes to fill, I think I’m up to the task,” DiSarno confidently acknowledged. And DiSarno is certainly more than qualified for the task.</p><p>DiSarno, who grew up in Brooklyn and moved to Connecticut when he was 10 years old, only began to run as a high school freshman because his mother thought he was too small to play football and didn’t want him to get hurt. As DiSarno noted, his mother made the “right decision” because he proved himself to be an all-star athlete in track and field. As a high school runner, he was selected twice for the All-State team and was placed on the All-New England team as a high school senior. DiSarno then attended Fordham University on a track scholarship. While at Fordham, he mainly competed in the 10,000-meter and 5,000-meter runs and was team captain as a senior. In addition, DiSarno was twice named to the prestigious Intercollegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America (ICAAAA) All-East Team in cross country. But DiSarno remains humble about his accomplishments. “More importantly, the friendships that I made with my teammates at Fordham are what shaped me into the person that I am today.”</p><p>DiSarno is much more than an accomplished athlete; he is also a sixth-grade social studies teacher and the cross country and track coach at Robert F. Wagner Middle School in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Though Wagner is a large middle school with a track team, it did not have a cross country team. However, in 2014, the principal at Wagner allowed DiSarno to spearhead Wagner’s first cross country program.</p><p>In the short time DiSarno has been coaching Wagner’s cross country team, the Wagner middle school runners have enjoyed great success, which he hopes will also translate to continued success for the Stuyvesant cross country runners. Under his helm, the Wagner girls’ cross country team won three straight NYC titles and the Wagner boys’ cross country team won two consecutive titles. However, DiSarno considers Wagner’s win at the 2016 City Championship in spring track to be his “most satisfying accomplishment.” This win was very special to him because it was the culmination of three years of hard work for his eighth-grade athletes for whom he had started the cross country program at Wagner.</p><p>DiSarno’s pride for his athletes is apparent as he has followed their successes in their respective high schools: “That group of kids are now sophomores, and as freshmen, they won city championships, borough championships, county championships and two were even named All-Americans.” One such athlete who has enjoyed great success as a cross country runner at Stuyvesant is sophomore Baird Johnson, who had DiSarno as his cross country coach when he attended Wagner middle school and is proud to have him again. “Coach DiSarno is an enthusiastic, upbeat, even-keeled leader,” he said. “He meets each runner where they are and helps them get [to] where they want to be. He was a collegiate runner, and the experience he brings to Stuyvesant will help mitigate the loss of USATF Hall of Fame Coach Mark Mendes.”</p><p>Remarkably, DiSarno has seamlessly been able to navigate coaching both the Stuyvesant and the Wagner cross country teams. In order to be able to focus on coaching one team at a time, he continues to coach the Wagner cross country team on the two afternoons the team practices and coaches the Greyducks the other afternoons. On the two days DiSarno coaches the Wagner team, the Greyducks practice with their longstanding assistant coach and Stuyvesant statistics teacher Bernard Feigenbaum. During those two days, the Greyducks run downtown, where they are “running easy miles to strengthen their legs and build their stamina,” according to DiSarno. The Greyducks run the other three days in Central Park, where they focus on improving their speed and hill-running ability. The change in pace between training in Central Park and running downtown has helped the Greyducks gain further strength and agility.</p><p>When asked about the difference between coaching the middle school and the high school cross country teams, DiSarno’s sense of humor readily emerges: “There’s a lot less whining with high school runners, but there’s definitely more enthusiasm with middle school kids.”</p><p>Looking at the current team, DiSarno noted that because the Greyducks’ top three runners—Kiyan Tavangar, Greg Dudick and Harvey Ng—graduated in 2017, “matching last year’s success won’t be easy.” In addition, while the Greyducks have won two PSAL championships in a row, PSAL and Milesplit.com have picked the team to finish anywhere between fifth and seventh this season. DiSarno has “tried to use those predictions as motivation for the boys.” “I don’t know if we will have a front-runner this year, so it will be important to run as a pack and finish as closely to one another as possible. It’s not the easiest way to win a championship, but it certainly can be done,” he said.</p><p>But to the Greyducks’ new head coach, the team’s success this year will not be solely defined by attaining another championship. Rather, the team’s success will be defined by what DiSarno views as his coaching philosophy. “I’ve tried to let the boys know that I can only take them so far. They have to take ownership of their training if they are going to get faster and if we are going to have success as a team. Team goals aside, if every boy runs faster at the end of the season than he did at the start, then we can call that a success. And that will happen if we run as a team, pushing one another to do better.”</p><p>Senior and co-captain, Minhein Htet, echoed that DiSarno’s goal is for the runners to “[b]uild a good base and then build speed.” Htet also noted that while DiSarno “is much less intimidating than Mendes,” he “allows the captains a fair bit of autonomy, just like Mendes.”</p><p>For now, the Greyducks are training hard and hoping not only to continue the team’s winning streak, but also to improve their personal best with a faster time under the the guidance of their two coaches. While DiSarno humbly adds that he is “honored to take over such a prestigious program,” it is clear that the Greyducks are also honored to have him as their new head cross country coach.</p>	Article	81	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
731	﻿Baseball Culture: Time for a Change Max is fed up with baseball culture, and pledges to stop being a part of the problem, and hopes MLB players do the same. <p>As I stepped up to the plate, I already knew what was coming. It was the first inning of a scoreless game and I was leading things off for our side, but my outcome had been set in stone. I was ready to be drilled by the first pitch.</p><p>Instead of going up to the plate with a mentality of “looking for the right pitch,”  I approached hoping, “don’t hit a bone, please.” Sure enough, the first pitch made a loud thud on my quad, and I didn’t quite know how to react. I was initially pent up with anger, but charging the mound wasn’t an option considering my significant weight and strength disadvantage. So I settled for an angry stare back at the pitcher. Many MLB players, however, wouldn’t have taken such a path following the same incident.</p><p>In my case, getting thrown at was retaliation for me unintentionally hitting the leadoff batter of the opposing team, so as both baseball and the mob dictate: “You hit us, we hit you.” While I never saw a single player on that team again, the same certainly can’t be said between Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Jose Bautista and the Texas Rangers, who have had an ongoing beef since the 2015 playoffs.</p><p>In the do-or-die game five of the American League Division Series (ALDS), Bautista hit what would end up being a game-deciding three-run home run. At the crack of the bat, he and the 50,000 fans in attendance knew it was gone, so he did what any human being would do at that moment—he celebrated. The moment of celebration in a bat flip—not the fact that he gave up a series-clinching home run—didn’t sit well with Rangers pitcher Sam Dyson, who remarked after the game that Bautista needed to “calm that down.”</p><p>Bautista was 34 years old when he hit the biggest home run of his career, and one of the most famous home runs in recent baseball history. About 31 years of hard work—since tee-ball—had finally paid off and turned him into an icon in Toronto sports history. And he’s supposed to calm down? If you look around in other sports, “calming down” isn’t a common theme. Cam Newton and Odell Beckham Jr. celebrate for extended periods of time in the endzone, while James Harden and LeBron James have picked up signature celebrations following big shots. But in baseball, where tradition reigns, the same tradition that kept black players out of the league until 1947 and refused advancement in the form of instant replay for decades, Bautista is in the wrong.</p><p>The Rangers would retaliate, as a bench-clearing brawl ensued on May 15 the following season, and Bautista took one in the chin from Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor. Yet, in the grand scheme of things, Odor wasn’t the villain for punching an opponent during a baseball game. No, it was Bautista who had it coming for his moment of celebration.</p><p>He isn’t alone in being villainized. Carlos Gomez has been thrown at several times for bat flips, Manny Machado has thrown his bat at opponents after being thrown at, and Alex Rodriguez was thrown at by then-Boston Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster for steroid use, despite already receiving a suspension of over a year from the MLB.</p><p>For over 100 years, baseball has policed itself through bruises and insults at all levels. Back then, it may have been different, but today, it’s a bunch of players who are more concerned about their personal beef than winning. So, the next time I get hit, retaliation or not, I’m going to jog to first and happily take my base. Hopefully, MLB players will start to do the same.</p>	Article	83	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
732	﻿Greyducks Struggle in Mayor’s Cup to Start Season but Remain Optimistic  <p>As the championship race neared its end on a brisk, sunny day in Van Cortlandt Park, senior and co-captain Min Hein Htet, senior and co-captain Jesse Sit, and junior Justin Zhang crossed the finish line almost in unison, out of breath, but content. Despite finishing 11th out of 24 teams, the Greyducks met their expectations and were pleased with their overall showing.</p><p>Heading into the meet, the prestigious NYC Mayor’s Cup, Stuyvesant’s boys’ cross country team, the Greyducks, was not expecting to finish in first or second place. Last year’s team placed 6th at the same event; however, its top three runners, Kiyan Tavangar, Gregory Dudick, and Harvey Ng, have graduated. This was the first race that the varsity team would be running together, so the team’s chemistry and game plan weren’t at their best. For example, senior and co-captain Matt Fairbanks was injured and did not run. Additionally, the team has not yet had enough practices to work on their speed training and hill-running strength. “We’re aiming to peak in early November, so there are some aspects of training that we’ve only just started focusing on,” first-year coach Carl Disarno said. As a result, race times for the Greyducks were slower than usual.</p><p>Sophomore Baird Johnson’s time for the 2.5-mile championship race was 14:12.1, though Disarno said that “he certainly didn’t run as fast as he is capable [of running].” Htet placed 55th with a time of 14:50.3, followed closely by Sit in 58th (14:57.8) and Zhang in 59th (15:01.1). Sophomore Oliver Cai (67th), junior Caleb Hoo (68th), and junior Steven Zheng (97th) rounded out the varsity team. Susan Wagner High School won first place in the Mayor’s Cup, while Brooklyn Tech High School and Trinity High School earned second and third place, respectively.</p><p>The team was satisfied with its performance and accomplished its goals for the event.  “My goal for this meet was to have our second through fifth runners [be] as close to one another as possible, and we only had a 23-second gap between our second and sixth runners, which I thought was great,” Sit said. “Many of us ran PRs [personal records] which is a nice start.”</p><p>The Greyducks’ captains are cautiously optimistic about the team’s future. “So far we've been doing a lot of mileage and not as many hard workouts, so in these next few weeks, we’ll be moving towards more workouts to get race ready,” Sit said. He has already set goals for the next event, the Manhattan Invite, which takes place on October 15. He hopes that Johnson’s time will be below 13:30 and that the next three Stuyvesant runners will have sub-14:30 times.  Other captains agreed with this: “By the end of the season, I'm confident we'll become faster,” Htet said. “The only way our team is going to have a shot at making states is through a deep team, which means that we need a good quantity of guys who won't lose to anyone except the stars of the rival teams.”</p><p>A main concern for the Greyducks is injury, noting that Fairbanks and Johnson are both hurt. The Greyducks “need to improve on injury prevention techniques. They need to understand that taking days off to recover while the problem is still not critical is important,” Htet said.</p><p>As the Greyducks look to improve in the next meet, Coach Disarno summed up the team’s 2017 outlook: “I think we have our work cut out for us in order to achieve our goals of winning the Borough Championship and qualifying for the state meet, but it’s not out of our reach.”</p>	Article	84	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
733	﻿Language Department Hosts Stuyvesant’s First Oktoberfest An Oktoberfest celebration was held in the cafeteria on October 16. <p>The Stuyvesant foreign language department celebrated Oktoberfest by hosting an event in its honor on Thursday, October 16. Oktoberfest, a Bavarian festival, runs from mid-September to the beginning of October. It is one of the world’s largest folk festivals and gives visitors the opportunity to eat traditional food while enjoying numerous activities.</p><p>Stuyvesant’s Oktoberfest celebration, which was held in the cafeteria, strived to showcase German culture. German and Bavarian flags were hung up. “There was German music playing in the hallway all day long. There were German songs, poetry, and videos. There was lots and lots of German food,” Assistant Principal of World Languages Dr. Ernest Oliveri said.</p><p>German teacher Rebecca Lindemulder was in charge of planning and organizing the event. “We wanted to give the German students a chance to experience a bit of German culture first-hand and participate in a long-standing Bavarian tradition,” Lindemulder said in an e-mail interview. “We wanted to open it up to all students in order to educate our fellow students on the festival and also give everyone the chance to experience German culture and Gemütlichkeit, the concept of coziness, contentedness, comfort, and relaxation, and enjoying a good, fun time with friends with food and drink, all together.”</p><p>Many German students also helped prepare for the event by making decorations and cooking food. “At Oktoberfest we had Bratwurst, Chicken Schnitzel, Frikadellen, Kaesespaetzle (something close to a German version of mac and cheese), potato pancakes, sauerkraut, potato salad, apple cake, and a few other things,” Lindemulder said.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri and Lindemulder were generally pleased with the enthusiasm students showed at the event. “Everyone was having a good time and there were many people there,” Dr. Oliveri said. They are planning to continue holding it in coming years.</p><p>The foreign language department has plans to have many more cultural events. Some of the upcoming events include “Día de los Muertos” on November 1 and 2, a performance by the German band “Die Lochis” on December 4, and Japan Day on May 3. “[The goal is] to bring more culture and exposure to the students of Stuyvesant,” Dr. Oliveri said.</p>	Article	90	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
734	﻿Caribbean Catastrophes Unite Stuyvesant Students and faculty worked together to hold a relief fundraiser for Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Virgin Islands, following recent devastation in the areas. <p>Students and faculty came together to hold a two week-long fundraiser to provide aid for Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, following the recent natural disasters that occurred there. The fundraiser began on Wednesday, October 4, and ended on Friday, October 20.</p><p>In September, Mexico was struck by an 8.2 magnitude earthquake and a 7.1 magnitude earthquake, killing hundreds of people. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were devastated by Hurricane Maria, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record, in the same month. One month later, many of these areas are still facing a humanitarian crisis.</p><p>The fundraiser started as a collaborative effort between SPARK, Spectrum, Stuyvesant Key Club, the world languages department, and the Sophomore and Senior Caucuses. The Senior Caucus spearheaded the effort with SPARK Coordinator Angel Colon and Spanish teachers Pasqua Rocchio and Anna Montserrat and approached the Sophomore Caucus and individual clubs to involve more students. “We were very supportive of the idea, as was the entire [Student Union (SU)], and so the drive became a co-effort,” Sophomore Caucus President Vishwaa Sofat said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Volunteers collected cash donations and basic supplies from students on the second floor. The flags of Puerto Rico and Mexico and posters advertising the drive were set up throughout the school. Blurbs about the fundraiser were also included in the newsletters sent out by Parent Coordinator Dina Ingram and the SU.</p><p>Many other clubs and organizations collaborated to help the fundraiser, as well. Spectrum sold stickers and pins to raise awareness for the LGBTQ+ community, and donated all proceeds to the drive. ASPIRA, Stuyvesant’s Hispanic culture club, donated all profits from their Hispanic Heritage Month Dinner to the cause.</p><p>The Sophomore and Senior Caucuses will send the money to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which will then be used to help rebuild impacted communities. “UNICEF is known for their humanitarian emergency aid. They have projects set up [in the] areas of disaster to make sure affected families have the resources, especially water and hygiene support,” Sophomore Caucus Vice President Eve Wening said.</p><p>Key Club is working simultaneously with New York and Puerto Rican partnerships to see that the physical goods are shipped to the affected areas and distributed.</p><p>The Sophomore Caucus hopes to use this experience for future fundraisers. “Initially, we weren’t sure how much money we would collect, but the Stuyvesant population proved to be generous and active citizens in the global community,” Sofat said.</p><p>“After seeing how successful this fundraiser was we have more confidence moving forward, and hopefully, Stuyvesant can continue to help those in need across the world,” Wening said.</p>	Article	88	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
735	﻿Computers and Costumes With gaping, circular mouths, fist-sized eyeballs, and draping robes, the Computer Science department transformed into multicolored martians: Sesame Street’s very-own “Yip-Yips.” <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>With gaping, circular mouths, fist-sized eyeballs, and draping robes, the Computer Science department transformed into multicolored martians: Sesame Street’s very-own “Yip-Yips.”</p><p>Last year, the department came together to bring these fascinating characters to life, shopping together and actually creating the costumes after-school. “We stayed at school until 8 p.m. There was a lot of felt. And a lot of hot glue strings in the office,” Computer Science Coordinator JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver recalled.</p><p>While these costumes may have been a little more avant-garde than usual, dressing up as a department is a long-standing tradition. In 2014, the year of the office-supply superheroes, Dyrland-Weaver was a stapler, Topher Brown Mykolyk was a ruler, Yulia Genkina was an eraser, and Samuel Konstantinovich was the “unspecified” villain (after all, even office-supply superheroes need a villain).</p><p>They usually create the costumes the weekend before Halloween—not too early and not too late. “Last year was the first year where there was a mass constructing of the costumes. We had glue guns and scissors and things,” Dyrland-Weaver said.</p><p>The original idea to dress up together was developed by former Computer Science Coordinator Michael Zamansky who began dressing up for Halloween even before Dyrland-Weaver was a student here. “I believe his goal was generally to have the students understand a bit of his personality—to get to know their teacher in a different light,” Dyrland-Weaver explained.</p><p>Having a teacher wear a fun costume would be a way for the students to get to know the teacher in a different light. “It’s good for students to understand a little bit of who I am. We’re in a room together for 40 minutes for five days of every week. We see each other a lot! In order to have a good educational experience, it’s important that I understand that our students are people who are not just doing computer science. They should understand that I’m a person, and I think humanizing the teacher is good for students in the same way I would like to humanize the students so that I know them better,” Dyrland-Weaver said.</p><p>Before this tradition was established, only Zamansky put on a costume for Halloween. One year, he dressed up as Bob Ross, painting during his classes. In fact, one of the paintings he made still hangs in room 307.</p><p>Another year, he came as Homer Simpson. “He was yellow. He came in with a white polo shirt, blue pants, yellow body, with the right amount of stubble and a shaved head,” described Dyrland-Weaver, remembering the costume from when he was a student in Zamansky’s class at Stuyvesant. “I knew Zamansky was goofy, so I wasn’t surprised, but it was very funny. He taught the entire class as Homer, which was also great.”</p><p>When Dyrland-Weaver came back to Stuyvesant as a teacher, he was asked to be a part of the new Stuyloween tradition. “Since I was a former student of Zamansky’s, he basically told me that my job as a computer science teacher was contingent upon me joining him in the Halloween tradition,” he said.</p><p>Throughout the years, as the Computer Science department grew, there were more and more teachers participating and donning a costume. Despite Zamansky leaving Stuyvesant in 2015, Dyrland-Weaver and his colleagues decided to continue the tradition.</p><p>Genkina, who very recently left Stuyvesant, had been a part of the costume tradition. “She was a wonderful addition to our crew, and she was thrilled [about] the costume tradition. Honestly, if we didn’t have one, I bet she would’ve started it,” Dyrland-Weaver said. “I’ve actually told her she should come back here on Halloween. She did not immediately reject the idea.”</p><p>One of Dyrland-Weaver’s favorite costumes includes when he and Zamansky took the costume of infomercial personalities; Dyrland-Weaver was Vince Offer (the Shamwow/Slapchop guy), and Zamansky was Billy Mays (the OxiClean guy). “We tried to sell our students the products. We also came up with products of our own,” Dyrland-Weaver said. One of them was the Grade-Gone™, which was basically just white-out for a really bad grade on a test. The Advanced Grade-Gone™, had a red pen taped to it, so that you could put a new grade on. “It was just a lot of fun. There are videos of these online,” Dyrland-Weaver noted.</p><p>A costume that involved extensive preparation was when Dyrland-Weaver and Zamansky decided to dress up as the Blues brothers. “We watched YouTube videos and learned the song and the dance,” Dyrland-Weaver said. “Doing a song and dance for every period of the day was exhausting, though.”</p><p>The longest part of the process is figuring out what the theme will be. “Being Stuyvesant people, we procrastinate, and then it’s October, and it’s like, what are we going to do? Eventually, we do figure it out,” Dyrland-Weaver said.</p><p>For ideas and themes, the department decides on an idea that would interest everyone. “The stupider the better,” Dyrland-Weaver said. However, there is one unspoken rule that everyone obeys: no repeats. No matter what costume they decide to put on, there shall never be a repeat of a costume done in a previous year.</p><p>Usually, they just e-mail ideas to each other and stay after school to discuss ideas further. This process is very secretive: anyone outside of the computer science department will not know what the theme is until the day of. “We can’t talk about what we do to people who overhear,” Dyrland-Weaver joked.</p><p>“No comment,” Dyrland-Weaver insisted when I asked what exactly they would dress up as this year.</p><p>“I am not sure that I am at liberty to discuss the details of this clandestine organization,” Brown Mykolyk added.</p><p>Computer Science Department Costumes</p><p>Year</p><p>Costume Theme + Participants</p><p>2008</p><p>Blues Brothers (Dyrland-Weaver and Zamansky)</p><p>2009</p><p>Infomercial Guys</p><p>Vince Offer (Shamwow/Slapchop guy): Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Billy Mays (OxiClean guy): Zamansky</p><p>2010</p><p>Austin Powers</p><p>Dr. Evil: Zamansky</p><p>2011</p><p>Benders</p><p>2012</p><p>Swedish Chef (from The Muppets)</p><p>Zamansky, Konstantinovich, and Dyrland-Weaver did variations of Chefs in honor of Richard Geller, a math teacher</p><p>2013</p><p>Star Trek</p><p>Bones: Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Captain Kirk: Zamansky</p><p>Spock: Konstantinovich</p><p>Scottie: Brown Mykolyk</p><p>2014</p><p>Office Supply Super Heroes</p><p>Stapler: Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Ruler: Brown Mykolyk</p><p>Eraser: Genkina</p><p>Villain: Konstantinovich</p><p>2015</p><p>Inside Out</p><p>Anger: Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>Joy: Zamansky</p><p>Sadness: Konstantinovich</p><p>Disgust: Brown Mykolyk</p><p>2016</p><p>Sesame Street Martians</p><p>Genkina, Khevelev, Brown Mykolyk, Konstantinovich, and Dyrland-Weaver</p><p>*** Note that 2008 was not the first year of the costume tradition; it began long before that, even before Dyrland-Weaver was a student.</p><p>Video Links:</p><p>Link to the Halloween Playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KxKa8NpFxJYgovyJhF4HZRsAqYKBLiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KxKa8NpFxJYgovyJhF4HZRsAqYKBLiG</p>	Article	92	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
736	﻿Trumping the Tax System Tax cuts are essential in this competitive economy to combat the relocation of American corporations, and stimulate the rise of small businesses, the crux of our national pride. <p>Imagine if the average American had an additional $652 a year to spend as he or she wished. For many people, this extra money would go a long way. Now consider that this money would not come at anyone’s financial expense. While this may sound too good to be true, this figure is the average amount the Trump administration’s tax plan would save families in the 95th percentile of income earners and below.</p><p>The Trump administration has billed this proposed tax cut as the “largest tax reform” in U.S. history. The plan has come under sharp criticism from politicians and constituents claiming the tax cuts disproportionately favor the rich. Despite these criticisms, the Trump administration's tax plan would benefit people and businesses across the economic ladder.</p><p>Many liberal politicians have dismissed the tax cuts, claiming that they give the rich an undeserved break. However, the idea that the “rich don't pay their fair share” is a myth. The top 10 percent of earners was responsible for 45 percent of all taxes on income, paying an average rate of 26 percent of their income. This is in stark contrast to the bottom 50 percent of earners, who pay six percent of total taxes at an average rate of four percent. This does not suggest that the poor don't pay their fair share, but rather that the pervasive idea that the wealthy are somehow the winners of our country's tax system is erroneous. Therefore, the Trump administration’s 4.6 percent tax cut for individuals making over $418,000 a year will not unfairly skew the tax system towards the rich, but rather provide the rich with tax relief that will encourage them to reinvest into society, and in the process benefit people across the economic ladder.</p><p>The single most influential change to tax policy is the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to either 15 or 20 percent. While this may seem to be a handout to large multinational corporations, upon closer rumination it is anything but that. The U.S.’s corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the third highest in the world. The most obvious consequence of this high rate is that it encourages companies to relocate overseas.</p><p>For example, Johnson Controls, a company worth $23 billion, moved its headquarters from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Ireland in 2016. It cited the fact that the move would save the company about $150 million in U.S. taxes annually as its reason.</p><p>When a company relocates overseas, the economy loses the jobs, growth, and investment potential the company possesses. This is a lose-lose situation for both the American government and the American consumer, as they both suffer the effects of reduced investment, job availability, and economic growth.</p><p>A high corporate tax rate also incentivizes companies to store their earnings overseas in order to avoid heavy taxation. A study by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that “untaxed foreign earnings of American companies totaled approximately $2.6 trillion in 2015.” The same study found that if a corporate tax cut were offered to these companies on the condition that they returned this cash back to the U.S., $663 billion would be reinvested into job growth and business expansion in the United States.</p><p>Not only will the proposed reform stimulate American corporations to stay wholly American, but it will provide some much needed relief to small businesses. A recent survey by CNBC indicated that the number one concern for business owners is their taxes; a whopping 42 percent believed that a tax break as large as the one offered could have a tremendously positive impact on the small business economy.</p><p>Currently, mom-and-pop shops across the U.S. pay a rate from 15 to 40 percent of their individual income rates. The repeal of Bush-era tax cuts left businesses reeling at added expenses in a crippled economy. The newest tax reform would offer a uniform 15 percent tax rate regardless of their affiliations, such as partnerships, sole proprietors, or freelancers. This tax reform leaves millions of small business owners with a larger profit and additional revenue that could be used to reinvest into the company.</p><p>Opponents claim tax cuts would reduce funding toward essential government programs surrounding public health, medical research, climate change, etc. However, less money doesn’t mean these programs will become obsolete. For each one, there’s almost always a political backer willing to advocate for the program’s necessity to the national government and fight to keep it viable, even with reduced funding. The Heritage Foundation finds that there are somewhere from 79 to 140 federal programs currently fighting to reduce poverty, each with overlapping incentives.</p><p>For instance, historian Allen J. Matusow of Rice University wrote that Medicare and Medicaid have done considerably little to benefit the quality of living for the elderly (one of their main objectives), serving instead to raise health care costs for taxpayers. With an annual price tag of about $600-900 billion on their own, Trump’s intention is to eliminate spending where it’s wasteful, not vital.</p><p>American ideals boast diligence, entrepreneurship, and a sort of blind aspiration that’s produced some of the most brilliant minds in history. However, this enormous capacity for innovation is often limited by a single materialistic thing: money. Tax cuts are essential for this competitive economy to combat the relocation of American corporations and stimulate the rise of small businesses, the crux of our national pride. The public is done vouching for an exhausted agenda: they need to see some real tax cuts, real soon.</p>	Article	93	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
737	﻿School Counselors and Students: A Necessary Therapy Session Stuyvesant school counselors need to be more proactive in being able to provide adequate support for their students. <p>At first glance, school counselors have a very straightforward goal: to offer academic and emotional support to their students during high school. This includes handling course requests, writing the Secondary School Recommendation (SSR) for colleges, and checking up on their students’ mental states and home situations. School counselor Undine Guthrie summarizes this, saying, “The guidance office is a place where you can go to get tons of information to help you achieve whatever you need to accomplish.”</p><p>Yet the counseling department at Stuyvesant might not fully support all students. Only 41 percent of Stuyvesant students surveyed reported that their school counselor was helpful in terms of emotional support. This is despite the counseling department’s attempts at being more proactive and encouraging their students to come to them for guidance. For instance, counselors have mandatory meetings with their respective homerooms or meetings with small groups of students during freshman year. The problem is that these mandatory meetings with school counselors are usually not individualized, instead addressing a freshman homeroom or a group of students as a whole.</p><p>Besides these prearranged meetings, counselors also face the issue of not always being physically in their office. In order to remedy this, the counseling office implemented a “buddy system,” which allows students to visit a different school counselor and talk to them if their school counselor is unavailable at the time.</p><p>The “buddy system,” however, overlooks the connection and familiarity all students should ideally have with their school counselors. The system is problematic for some students because they may be uncomfortable to talk about their personal and academic matters with another adult, especially one that they do not have a personal connection with. Junior Maya Furusho notes, “ I feel like it’s not the same when you talk to a school counselor that’s not your own.” This becomes an issue when a student has a personal issue and needs counseling, but does not feel comfortable talking to a school counselor.</p><p>In light of some of these shortcomings with a program that has the potential to help so many students, it’s clear that the counseling department needs to implement more concrete and uniform measures in order to help students feel more comfortable around school counselors. All freshmen should have at least one mandatory one-on-one meeting scheduled with their school counselor. An individual meeting can ensure that school counselors have a chance to break the ice with freshmen and check on their transition from middle school to high school.</p><p>Past that first individual meeting, the counseling department should implement an online system, similar to the one currently used by the college office, for making appointments with school counselors. This would make it easier for students to find a time to visit their own school counselors because school counselors can easily post and notify students when they are available in their office during school hours every day of the week online. Students would be able to schedule appointments based on their school counselor’s availability and provide their reason for visiting.</p><p>This system would be convenient for both students and school counselors. Compared to the current e-mail based system, an online system would be able to clearly indicate when school counselors will not be busy during the week. This would give foresight to school counselors about why students want to visit and holds school counselors accountable for creating and keeping appointments.</p><p>Once students arrive for their scheduled meeting, counselors should also take the initiative of making their offices a welcoming place. When asked about factors that deterred her from getting closer with her school counselor, Junior Camilla Cheng commented, “Sometimes my school counselor has people [upperclassmen] hanging around his room and I get nervous [...] I don’t know how to approach him.” School counselors need to be able to adapt for shyer students and make themselves more approachable.</p><p>In order to make themselves more approachable, school counselors need to make sure that their offices are inviting by asking upperclassmen to hang out outside their offices in the counseling suite. This prevents upperclassmen from deterring students to visit their school counselors, which should be done in private.</p><p>But ultimately, when it comes to improving the effectiveness of Stuyvesant’s guidance program, a part of the responsibility falls on the students’ shoulders. About 28 percent of surveyed Stuyvesant students reported that they visited another school counselor because they claimed that they knew their school counselor was unhelpful or had previous bad experiences with their school counselor. School counselor Paul Goldsman notes in an interview, “A lot of the things we do are intangible and can’t be seen and a lot of people think that we’re just doing nothing and sitting in front of a computer when in fact I can say with 100 percent certainty that that is not the case.”</p><p>Students must realize that school counselors do a lot of “behind the scenes” work, such as organizing the freshman seminars implemented this year by the counseling department as a way to help freshmen with their transition into Stuy. It’s imperative that they are as open as they can be with their students about what they can do to make sure that their students can get all the information they need or want.</p><p>Underclassmen especially should take advantage of the new Big Sib program this year, which requires Big Sibs to meet with their Little Sibs’ counselor and offer helpful information on individual students to the school counselor and encourage students to visit their school counselor more often.</p><p>The guidance system is far from perfect. But as Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey Pedrick noted in an interview, “We [school counselors] would really love it if the students could come in and introduce themselves to their school counselor. You can just come and say hi or come and talk to us and ask us and it can be positive, negative, a crisis, a high five, or a hug.”</p>	Article	94	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
738	﻿Our Changing Climate: Is Now the Time? But if we're not going to mention it now, when? <p>Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico as a category four hurricane, with winds over 155 mph, leaving 100 percent of the island without power on September 20th. These winds, rainfall, and heat were translated into a mix of waste-water, floodwaters, and trash in the streets, surgical operations performed in sweltering 95 degree weather, and a lack of waterborne-disease-free water. As the third strongest storm to ever hit US territory, Maria has done some irreparable damage. This has not been exclusive to one hurricane—over the course of this summer, the world has fallen victim to some of the worst major natural disasters in history.</p><p>The intensity of these hurricanes can be accredited to climate change, as NASA finds a global temperature rise, warming oceans, glacial retreat, and extreme events correlate with the recent influx of carbon emissions from industrialization. These effects of climate change are also contributing factors to extreme events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and floods. According to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, higher temperatures from the global temperature rise account for increased moisture in the air. For every degree Celsius increase, the percentage of moisture in the air increases by seven percent. Though this may seem like an insignificant digit, in the context that 2016 was the hottest recorded year in history, with eight months breaking records of the highest temperatures, the seven percent increase may suddenly become a 14 percent spike. It has been recorded that the waters of the Gulf of Mexico have increased 1.5 degrees from 1980—these subtle changes may be the culprits behind this year’s raging hurricane season. Just a 0.5 increase in temperature could result in a catastrophic hurricane, fed by the increased moisture in the atmosphere.</p><p>Climate change correlates with the onset of amplified natural disasters—however, skeptics of climate change have deemed even mentioning it as a cause as “insensitive” and “tasteless,” raising the question of the appropriateness of discussing climate change in light of all that has been going on recently. But if we're not going to mention it now, when?</p><p>In such a time of distress, it does seem relatively inappropriate to start finger-wagging—coverage should indeed be aid and rescue-based and based on spreading awareness, not political views. However, that is not to say that climate change should altogether be censored from news networks. In fact, despite this being heavily opinionated and political news, this plight needs to be addressed immediately, as it is an imminent danger to our world.</p><p>The most natural response to such disasters would be to reconsider rebuilding infrastructure and energy sources near bodies of water or coastal plains or other regions severely damaged by the hurricanes and floodwaters. However, such a response is only a short-term solution. We are really only beginning to scratch the surface of dealing with future disasters. By addressing these issues on a shallow level without considering the long-term effects of climate change, we are choosing to look through a limited scope. In reality, we must acknowledge the root of the issue and call for effective reform by cutting carbon emissions and establishing precautionary measures to reduce the damage next time, as per the Paris Agreement. By failing to do so, we are placing ourselves in the path of impending doom.</p><p>The current administration is going out of its way to evade the discussion of climate change, whether or not it is in the context of the recent hurricanes. In April, the EPA removed mention of climate change from its official website, and it is planning to repeal carbon dioxide emission regulations. Trump is also in the midst of repealing the Clean Power Plan, an emblem of the reform Obama had pushed for in his presidency. Others, such as Governor Rick Scott of Florida, have evaded the term so much that in order to pass certain bills or acknowledge certain discoveries, scientists must have “climate change”-free proposals or findings for him. At this point, the scientific community is subject to the power of the politician rather than the scientific method. Science has become a customizable political tool.</p><p>It shouldn’t be this way. In a period of indifference, these hurricanes are finally gaining attention, warning skeptics that the truth they’ve been censoring may have an effect on them. They may finally become the victims, and that makes all the difference. Now, discussing the potential causes of recent hurricanes is no less appropriate than discussing issues on gun control after a shooting—rather, it will never be more appropriate.</p><p>In order to address and face the consequences of these natural disasters, we must prioritize understanding and addressing the scientific causes behind them to educate the public, call for reform, and potentially prevent future instances. Without increased awareness in the public regarding their direct impact on the environment, this subject may never come to see the light of day, and it will become forgotten.</p><p>In light of Donald Trump’s rejection of all ideas “climate change” related, this is also a huge opportunity for scientists to finally take a stance and use current events in the world as evidence to further support the existence of climate change. The President has no issue with calling out issues related to immigration because it does not hurt big American business. Just remember that there will be no America, let alone business, in a world ravaged by preventable natural disasters.</p>	Article	95	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
825	﻿Israeli Defense Forces Come to Speak at Stuyvesant A Jewish woman and an Arab man came to Stuyvesant to talk about their experiences as soldiers in the Israeli army. <p>Two former Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers - Keren, a Jewish woman, and Tom, a Bedouin Arab - described their experiences while serving on Wednesday, October 25.</p><p>The event was organized by the Jewish Student Union (JSU). Senior and co-president Caleb Smith-Salzberg worked with Stand With Us, a pro-Israel educational organization, to arrange for the IDF soldiers to speak. “I am an intern at Stand With Us. They provide us with some potential speakers, and I thought that bringing soldiers to speak at a public school would be really cool and a good experience for a lot of students,” Smith-Salzberg said.</p><p>Unlike in most other countries, military service in Israel is mandatory at age 18 for both men and women. Men are required to serve for three years while women serve for two years. Arab Israelis are not required to serve; however, some volunteer for the draft.</p><p>Keren, a Jewish woman born in Israel, moved to New Jersey with her family when she was two years old and attended a public school in the state. Nevertheless, Keren always felt that Israel was the homeland for the Jewish people.</p><p>When she was 16, Keren decided to return to Israel. She lived with her grandmother in Israel until she joined the IDF at age 18. “The reason that I really wanted to join the IDF was because my family [had] been serving in the IDF and protecting Israel for three generations,” Keren said.</p><p>Upon joining the army, Keren began training to become a drill sergeant. “It was my dream job, perfect for my personality: yelling at people,” Keren said. She was injured two weeks before completing her training and had to shift to an office job with the army. Keren served in the Gaza border, a small strip of territory that lies between Egypt and Israel and the site of perpetual conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.</p><p>While serving in the army, Keren experienced being less than a kilometer away while missiles were being launched into Israel from Gaza. “There was this insane siren that shook us up, warning us that we had up to 15 seconds to run [to the next bomb shelter]. What we thought was going to be a 15-minute annoyance turned out to be a six hour night. It was terrifying,” she said.</p><p>Though Keren was discharged in November 2013, she continues to feel connected to the IDF and the paratroopers she worked with. During the Israeli incursion into Gaza in 2014, Keren described her feelings of helplessness and fear for the soldiers she had worked with. “I couldn’t believe that my babies […] were on the battlefield, protecting me and my family and the country we love so much,” she said.</p><p>Today, Keren is a student at Ben Gurion University, delving into topics such as Middle Eastern Studies, Politics, and Government. As part of a scholarship, she worked with Arabs and Jews and encouraged them to work with each other. “It's two groups of people that usually wouldn’t meet each other, and they got a chance to meet and become friends [...] even if they couldn’t speak the same language” Keren said.</p><p>In turn, Keren has started to develop new perspectives on the people on the other side of the Arab-Israeli conflict. “I had my own stereotypes. When I met with Arab Muslims [who] believed exactly what I believed, it was a wake up moment. The stereotypes were ridiculous. We don’t have to fight each other, and we can make peace with [each] other,” Keren said.</p><p>Tom, an Israeli Bedouin Arab, grew up in Bir al-Maksur, the largest Bedouin village in Israel. Bedouins are traditionally a nomadic Muslim group. In spite of the tensions between Jews and Muslims, Tom knew he wanted to join the IDF, as his father and brother had done before him. “[I joined] because [I felt] a sense of duty to protect the country that [I] grew up in,” Tom said.</p><p>Tom served in the air force with an anti-aircraft unit, which later worked on the Iron Dome, a missile defense system that detects, assesses, and intercepts rockets, artillery, and mortar that are shot at Israel. He was stationed in the West Bank, a Palestinian territory, where he faced molotov cocktails and stone throwing on a daily basis.</p><p>On one occasion, Tom arrested a Palestinian man who intended to launch a terrorist attack on Jews. When Tom questioned the man, he explained that he was doing it for his family. Tom was told that the Palestinian government gives monthly payments to the families of terrorists, yet those imprisoned by Israel are well fed and taken care of.</p><p>After experiencing life in the IDF, Tom is now a student who works with a nonprofit to physically train teenagers for their military service. Like Keren, Tom believes that everyone, irrespective of his or her religion, can cooperate and work together to create peace. “I believe that each [...] of us have a unique voice. We can work together toward our common goal,” Tom said.</p><p>Many of the students at the event enjoyed listening and learning from the soldiers. “I thought that the speakers were really cool. Since one of them lived in New Jersey her whole life, we could relate to her more and learn about her experience and transition going to Israel,” senior and vice-president of the JSU Elizabeth Chernob said.</p>	Article	223	2017-11-30 09:26:11.252687	2017-11-30 09:26:11.252687
826	﻿Senior Caucus Hosts Second Annual Pep Rally Stuyvesant held its second annual pep rally on Friday, November 3 with highlight performances from Stuy Legacy, cheer and dodgeball games. <p>It was almost like a scene out of a movie: during the second annual Pep Rally on Friday, November 3, the Stuyvesant Peglegs ran into the third floor gymnasium and broke through a banner that read #StuyStrong. The event was organized by Senior Caucus President Pallab Saha and Vice President Abie Rohrig  It was held in the third floor gymnasium and featured dance and cheer performances, as well as a dodgeball tournament.</p><p>Rohrig and Saha came up with the idea of having Stuyvesant’s first Pep Rally last year to lighten their class’s mood and raise school spirit as they felt morale was being dampened by heavy coursework.</p><p>Inspired by the success of last year’s Pep Rally, Rohrig and Saha decided to continue the tradition. “We were very happy with the Pep Rally last year. Over 230 people attended and we got lots of positive feedback, so we thought it would be wonderful to continue the tradition,” Saha said.</p><p>The planning for the Pep Rally began about a month in advance, with support from school administrators, including Athletic Director Peter Bologna.</p><p>It was held soon after the terror attack that occurred near Stuyvesant on Tuesday, October 31. Saha and Rohrig hoped it would help unite the Stuyvesant community. Principal Eric Contreras, who gave the initial remarks, added a minute of silence and spoke briefly about the solidarity and spirit of the Stuyvesant community after the terror incident. “This event was meant to benefit the school by giving the student body something to rally around, especially after the terrorist attack on Halloween. We felt that the event would be a platform for students to show their Stuyvesant grit and unity in an extremely profound way,” Saha said.</p><p>Members of the Peglegs also recognized the significance of this year’s Pep Rally falling so closely after the terror attack. “Especially after the attack earlier in the week, it felt amazing to be at the center of something that brought our school community together. Stuy can sometimes seem too big to have cohesive school spirit but the turnout proved me wrong. I hope we only get stronger from here and the event is a special way to achieve this,” junior and Pegleg member Ariel Melendez said.</p><p>“In my opinion I think more people attended the Pep Rally and attended the football game. More alumni attended the football game that day to feel like a family, to feel close together in that regard,” Bologna said. “There is no specific mascot for the school, a lot of the sports teams are not very highly promoted, or not many students come to see the sports programs in this school, so I think this is a way to showcase some of the teams, some of the accomplishments of the teams in the school.”</p><p>One of the highlights of the Pep Rally was a performance by Stuy Legacy, Stuyvesant’s competitive urban dance team, who debuted their new routine. The performance was followed by rounds of dodgeball between students of all grades levels. Each grade competed in brackets, until the Class of 2018 was the ultimate victor. This was then followed by another round of dodgeball between seniors and teachers, which ended with another senior victory.</p><p>“Holding another pep rally during our tenure as Senior Caucus is definitely doable. However, we are open to many different options. [Rohrig] and I are working meticulously in trying to find various other ways to celebrate Stuy athletics, and those ideas may come to life soon enough. But we urge our successors to continue our legacy and host at least one pep rally every year,” Saha said.</p>	Article	224	2017-11-30 09:27:10.569651	2017-11-30 09:27:10.569651
739	﻿First Student Elected as SLT Chair Jack Cruse has been named co-chair of the SLT, the first student in this position. <p>Senior Jack Cruse has been elected the 2017-2018 co-chair of the the School Leadership Team (SLT). He is the first student to ever serve in this position. Social studies teacher Linda Weissman is Cruse’s co-chair. Cruse already serves as Student Union (SU) representative for the SLT.</p><p>The SLT is comprised of parent representatives from each grade, administrators, and a student representative, who gather monthly to discuss issues at Stuyvesant and propose changes.  This year, because of the resignation of former chair and senior parent representative Julie Brown, the chair position was open. “Normally other teachers or parents will take [the position] on because it is a lot of work. This year, I put my name in the ring,” Cruse said.</p><p>The chair is chosen by the SLT members by vote. “[At] the first meeting, they hold open elections, in which someone can nominate themselves or someone else, and you have a vote on it,” Cruse said.</p><p>The chairs of the SLT set the agendas and take minutes for each meeting. “I help decide what is going to be talked about at meetings and meet with [Principal Eric] Contreras,” Cruse said. “I think once we have it down to a rhythm, [there] won't be that much added to the regular SLT duties.”</p><p>As SU representative, Cruse gives students a voice in SLT meetings. Cruse, with the assistance of his alternate junior Joshua Weiner, meets with caucuses to discuss changes desired by students and presents them to the SLT.</p><p>Cruse believes that having a student hold the role of chair will bring more issues to attention. “Students want to talk about certain issues, such as PSAL frees, or how last year we wanted to come back in earlier when it was really cold, but it would be hard to get them on the agenda,” he said. “If there is ever a really pressing issue for the school, I can modify [the agenda].”</p><p>Many students are pleased about Cruse’s new position. “I think it’s great [Cruse] is the co-chair of the SLT. Students should [be more involved] because we are the ones who are actually being affected by all of the changes,” junior Lauren Ng said.</p><p>Cruse is excited about this new challenge. “I just hope that this will help change Stuy and make it better for students,” he said.</p>	Article	89	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
740	﻿Breaking Down the Eagles’ Postseason After upset victories against Eleanor Roosevelt and Tottenville, the Stuyvesant Eagles’ season came to an end in a tight semifinal rematch with Roosevelt. <p>Losing does not come easily to a champion; a team that establishes a dominant, winning tradition has a hard time breaking it. Such was the case for Stuyvesant’s varsity golf team, the Eagles. “The team was pretty devastated,” coach Emilio Nieves said of the Eagles’ semifinals loss. After consecutive city championships and two consecutive seasons without a single loss, the team faced a tough end to the season.</p><p>With matchups against powerhouses in Hunter College High School and Eleanor Roosevelt High School, chances for Stuyvesant to regain the top slot were bleak. Though the Eagles took the match against Roosevelt, they were forced to forfeit the Hunter match, leaving them at a 5-2 record and in fourth place in the Manhattan League. With their first non-undefeated season in three years, the Eagles would no longer have the luxury of the top playoff seed and an easy matchup.</p><p>Last year, the Eagles faced Leon M. Goldstein High School (5-4), and were able to eliminate them, winning 4-1. This year, Stuyvesant faced Goldstein again, but in much different circumstances. As the 10th seed, and with an impressive 8-1 record, Goldstein was due to pose a challenge for the Eagles. However, like in the win over Roosevelt, the Eagles set the tone right off the bat with a hot start. Through the first three holes, nobody on Stuyvesant’s starting five posted a single total of over six strokes.</p><p>Additionally, the back end was dominant once again, particularly in the cases of senior and No. 3 golfer Kevin Zheng and freshman and No. 4 golfer Alexander Camaev. Neither of those two matches was particularly close; over the course of the match, Camaev and Zheng combined for just one hole of over six strokes. For contrast, Goldstein’s No. 3 and No. 4 golfers put up just one hole of under six strokes. From the beginning, the Goldstein match mimicked the previous victory against Roosevelt. Though it ended up slightly closer, the Eagles still finished with a comfortable 3-1 win.</p><p>With that, the Eagles were set to face their toughest challenge yet. Playing as the lower seed for the first time in four years, Stuyvesant faced the second-seeded Tottenville High School, who finished the season 10-1, first in the Staten Island division. In Stuyvesant’s past two victories, the team was able to coast on the dominance of its back end over unbalanced starting lineups. Tottenville, however, boasted a deep lineup—a threat to the Eagles’ usual dominance. If their first round matchup was any indication, Tottenville’s bottom golfers would be just as strong as those at the top of the lineup. In a 5-0 shellacking of Midwood, Tottenville’s No. 5 golfer, Blossom Yu, did not have a single hole that took more that five strokes.</p><p>Though Stuyvesant’s two stars, junior Christopher Chan and senior Nicholas Ng, were able to lose matches against Roosevelt and Goldstein and still see the team win, the Eagles simply could not afford for this to happen against a team like Tottenville. For Stuyvesant to advance, the team needed to get off to a similarly fast start, and to see similar dominance from Camaev and the rest of the back end once again. On top of that, Chan and Ng needed to go toe-to-toe with Thomas Sclafani and Nicholas Khoury of Tottenville. This was possible, as Chan’s regular-season nine-hole total of 34 is less than Sclafani’s of 35, meaning that a head-to-head victory was not out of the question. Yet, even with the tall odds, the team still had  confidence going into the match. “It will probably be tough, but I have faith in our team,” Ng said before the match.</p><p>Though the previous victories over Roosevelt and Goldstein can be attributed to the dominance of the back end, the Eagles’ match against Tottenville was defined by the success of Chan, Ng, and Zheng, who came through in the clutch. Chan was as strong as he has ever been, and with all six of his holes ending up at under six strokes, he made quick work of Sclafani.</p><p>Zheng was even more impressive, posting a full nine-hole match with eight of the nine holes under six strokes. Though the match went down to the wire, and despite being beaten in the nine-hole total, 44-45, Zheng’s consistency earned him a victory in the end. With a similarly spectacular performance from senior and No. 5 starter Neil Yang, the Eagles managed an improbable upset against the No. 2 seed in the city, winning 3-1.</p><p>In the semifinals, the Eagles were set for a rematch against Roosevelt. Chan seemed to have an inkling that this would happen after the first Roosevelt match: “Just beating a division rival was great for team morale, especially because we could face them in the playoffs,” he said after the regular season victory. Yet, even with team morale being as high as it was, the Eagles could not put it together in the semifinals.</p><p>While the match against Tottenville was the epitome of consistency, the showdown with Roosevelt quickly turned into the opposite. Though Yang had himself a day once again, the rest of the starting five underperformed, as each member posted multiple holes of six strokes or higher. Though the matches of Chan and Ng went down to the wire, with Ng’s in particular going into a tiebreak, the Eagles could not pull out a win and fell, losing 2-3.</p><p>Despite having been eliminated, Ng remains hopeful for the future. “A bunch of the younger players are really stepping up and I think that we’ll all keep improving,” he said. However, with hope, there also comes apprehension. Ng, Zheng, and Yang comprise three-fifths of the Eagles’ starting lineup, and are all graduating seniors. Knowing the effects of the loss of star Niel Vyas a year prior, the effect of this should once again be profound, as it is never easy to replace more than half of a starting lineup.</p><p>Though the team still has a solid core of Chan and Camaev to build around, Nieves understands the need for young talent. “A few new good freshmen would also help continue the success we have had over the last five years,” he said, showing optimism in the possibility of new prospects. Seeing that the non-starters combined for exactly one match played this season, it is apparent that inexperience is rife on this team. Ultimately, next year’s Eagles will either sink or swim depending on the ability of members to step up and on the talent of next year’s freshman crop.</p>	Article	167	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
741	﻿Troll Living Under Tribeca Bridge Reemerges With backpacks that weigh several times their own weight, members of the class of 2021 stampede across the Tribeca Bridge every morning at 7:59 a.m.... <p>With backpacks that weigh several times their own weight, members of the class of 2021 stampede across the Tribeca Bridge every morning at 7:59 a.m. Multiple freshmen have also been witnessed attempting to roll suitcases full of textbooks down the bridge.</p><p>This extravagance by the freshman class normally ends by the end of October, but has yet to happen. As such, a mysterious figure appeared in front of the stairs to the bridge, barring all from entering on October 29. This figure, who declared himself to be Lord Grendall Troll, claimed to live under the Tribeca Bridge.</p><p>“For decades, I have kept my silence but after the immense and prolonged ruckus caused by the incessant little munchkin devils, I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands,” Troll said. “To have to look over at Yeezys hanging over the roof of the bridge was abominable, but this was the final straw.”</p><p>Troll has imposed many limitations on the items allowed on the bridge. Any backpacks that cannot fit into a locker shall be immediately emptied and its contents thrown into the Hudson River. When questioned about the effects of large binders and five section notebooks on the ecosystem in the Hudson, Troll replied succinctly: “Everything in that river is dead.”</p><p>Any textbooks found will be immediately donated to the Borough of Manhattan Community College. Furthermore, any student who brings a rolling backpack will be redirected to John F. Kennedy airport.</p><p>Backpack restrictions are just the tip of the iceberg on Troll’s new rules for bridge usage. He has imposed new restrictions on the elevator by limiting its usage to couples or soon-to-be couples.</p><p>Seniors have welcomed Troll, cheering him on for finally instituting well-needed changes for the bridge. They have pushed Troll to create divided walkways reserved for seniors, crossing tolls for underclassmen, and venue fees for freshman Student Union campaigns.</p>	Article	108	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
742	﻿“It” is Nothing to Be Afraid Of Clowns aren’t inherently scary. Hollywood makes them scary. <spec-reference id=96></spec-reference><p>After 25 years of clowning, the Big Apple Circus’s “Grandma” clown was admitted to the Clown Hall of Fame in 2002. Barry Lubin, Grandma’s creator, designed a unique and dynamic character whose trademark stunt was head-standing on whoopee cushions, a highly advanced acrobatic feat. The Big Apple Circus estimates that in his 25 seasons with the show, Grandma made more than nine million people laugh.</p><p>However, modern-day clowns do more than just entertain—they’re altruistic. Ronald McDonald, a character created in 1963, is known for his philanthropic work as the mascot of the Ronald McDonald Foundation.</p><p>While McDonald has enjoyed a reputation as a national icon, the majority of clowns have been viciously defamed in recent years. In an attempt to undermine a competing form of entertainment, Hollywood has appropriated clown-related imagery to scare viewers into a fear of circuses. The portrayal of clowns in Batman (1966) and Funhouse (1987) may have placed the nail in the coffin for American circuses, putting thousands of clowns out of work. In the recently released horror film, “It,” Pennywise the Dancing Clown terrorizes the children of a suburban town, taking the shape of their worst fears and biting off their limbs. Special effects, lighting, and makeup combine to make Pennywise terrifying: he has three rows of teeth, a bizarre Scottish accent, and a maniacal smile.</p><p>Clowns without scary makeup and special effects are oafish, non-threatening, and even lovable. They’re endearingly awkward, and their stylish wigs make a timeless fashion statement. Their trademark big feet make them prone to clumsiness; Pennywise isn’t an accurate representation of the broader clown community because he’s fast and agile, making him far more threatening than the average clown. The iconic big red nose produces squeaking noises, making interaction with clowns a multi-sensory experience.</p><p>While clowns may take on mischievous personas during performances, there is a distinct difference between rascal behavior and homicidal tendencies. Clowns have only ever wanted to bring joy to young children and adults. Their portrayal in the media as fearsome killers has contributed to an ailing clown industry and the fall of a once-beloved icon.</p>	Article	102	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
743	﻿“It” Has a Point Clowns are really freaking scary because they’re so human. <spec-reference id=102></spec-reference><p>I used to laugh at coulrophobics. The fear of Stephen King’s impish, sharp-toothed, demon of an entertainer in the movie “It,” which terrorized the children of Derry by transforming into their worst fears and systematically tearing off their limbs, seemed unfounded. After all, clowns are real, regular people. And clowns are not supposed to be scary.</p><p>But a survey conducted earlier this year by Vox Media and Morning Consult revealed that Americans are more afraid of clowns than terrorist attacks, a family member dying, the collapse of the economy, climate change, or dying themselves. Two out of three Americans want police or government intervention to investigate clown scares. The Ringling Brothers Circus, coined the “Greatest Show on Earth,” hosted its last performance this year. But somehow, a light-hearted entertainer, created to cater to children and the glittery aura of the circus, has come to strike more fear into the hearts of Americans than the Taliban.</p><p>Clowns can be traced back all the way to 2500 B.C., when Pygmy clowns catered to Egyptian pharaohs. Imperial China, Ancient Rome, and medieval Europe all saw their version of these unpredictable, hyperbolically happy comedians.</p><p>But this perpetually happy nature is easily conceived as something much more devious. Clowns must paint on their wide smiles every morning, fixing their grinning countenance whether or not they feel that way. And as humans who are inclined to judge a person’s character and trustworthiness based on their facial expressions and actions, the clown is shifty and untrustworthy, a plastic man. Their laughter is chilling because it seems out of place in a situation that doesn’t require laughter; Stephen King’s clown Pennywise is scary because he is hiding in a storm drain with a shining red balloon instead parading around the fairgrounds.</p><p>The fact that clowns are humans, and that they are very real, is another strike against them. Unlike ghosts or aliens, which are blatantly figures of the imagination without any scientific backing or solid evidence, clowns exist and blend in as unremarkable characters. The image of the corrupted clown, steered toward evil because of mistreatment or unresolved anger, can (and arguably does) happen every single day. An enemy that walks among you and has unsupervised access to your children is justifiably frightening.</p><p>This fear of clowns has also led to mass hysteria and “copycats” that harnessed fear in order to receive attention. Remember, for instance, John Wayne Gacy Jr., who raped, tortured, and killed at least thirty-three young men in Illinois between 1972 and 1978. He operated under the persona of Pogo the Clown, who had pointed tips for his mouth (instead of the standard, kid-friendly rounded tips), and was called the Killer Clown as he painted jarring self-portraits of himself as Pogo in prison before he was executed through lethal injection. The clown sightings in South Carolina last year, which included a group of teenagers luring children into the woods, are just another example of people taking advantage of this fear.</p><p>But know that the fact that many clown “sightings” are orchestrated pranks does not detract from the tangible fear that Americans have of clowns; on the contrary, it only serves to stand as an example of the self-realization of the unnerving nature of these wide-eyed, grinning entertainers.</p>	Article	96	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
744	﻿Artists in the Making Teens from different New York City high schools talk about pursuing careers in the arts. <p>Everyone with a career in an artistic field has a wildly different story to tell. From having doting parents to finding a passion later in life, there are many ways artists can find success with their interests. Particularly in New York City, the high school an artist attends can have a huge effect on his or her pursuit of a career in a creative field. Whether the student is enrolled in an arts-focused school like LaGuardia or a school like Stuyvesant that emphasizes math and science, every aspiring artist’s profession and outlook is influenced by their high school years.</p><p>One of the most important parts of achieving success in an artistic career is practice. Statistics prove that at least 10,000 hours of practice are needed to master any skill. In his book, “Outliers,” Malcolm Gladwell examines a study done on violinists at the elite Academy of Music in Berlin. Gladwell finds that “by the age of 20, the elite performers had totaled 10,000 hours of practice” without relying on talent at all. In fact, Gladwell later writes that “once a top musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works.”</p><p>“I know that I've been drawing all my life,” sophomore Anaïs Real says. She attributes her success to her many hours of practice. “I started to properly learn how to draw on my own when I was 10,” she continues. Real’s hard work pays off: she recalls that the proudest moments of her artistic career were winning Gold and Silver keys in the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards. Real also takes inspiration from her mother, who is an artist as well.</p><p>Even though art is an important aspect of her daily life, Real isn’t so sure about a career in the field. Leaning towards creating art as a stress-free hobby, she says, “Being an artist is extremely difficult, and while I love it, it's not exactly something I want to have to do in order to get paid.” With money and picky commissioners thrown into the mix, Real worries about successfully gaining an audience for her work. “Career-wise, it’s always the money. There are very finicky people who commission art, and it can be hard to please them. I don’t want to do art for some random guy; I want to do art for me,” she adds. Real’s logic makes sense. Many artists do struggle for money when starting their careers, and it’s impossible to please everyone.</p><p>As for her school’s influence, Real doesn’t feel that Stuyvesant’s STEM-focused environment has a significant impact on her art-related aspirations. “Despite [...] attending Stuyvesant, a place notorious for the sciences and maths, I would like to take art classes in college,” she says. “It probably wouldn't be a major, but I'd enjoy it as additional classes, if they are available.” Stuyvesant, she says, isn’t a huge influence on her career choice. “I've always been more interested in zoology as a career, if I'll be honest,” Real finishes.</p><p>Some Stuyvesant students do struggle to balance a heavy workload with their creative interests. “What does stress me out from time to time is balancing my work with schoolwork for the next seven years,” said Stuyvesant sophomore Grace Goldstein, who is interested in writing musicals. “Sometimes I'm afraid that neither will be the best that they can be, because I'm spreading myself too thin doing both.” Goldstein has a point: with hours of homework, it can be hard to find time to devote to preparing for an already demanding job.</p><p>Goldstein, however, is not discouraged by Stuyvesant’s emphasis on math and science. “Contrary to popular belief, Stuy is a great place for creators, performers, and artists,” she claims. “I've met some other writers and songwriters at Stuyvesant, and a few of my friends even want to write musicals, which has definitely made me more excited than ever about my career path.” With organizations like STC and SING!, it is possible for Stuyvesant students to find a creative outlet within a strenuous academic environment.</p><p>Goldstein also draws inspiration from other successful works of theater, particularly “Rent,” a ‘90s rock musical written by the late composer Jonathan Larson. Goldstein reveals that in telling the story of a group of East Village artists in the midst of the AIDS crisis, “Rent” “reminds [her] of the strength, power, and camaraderie that comes from New Yorkers in the art world.” The production’s score and dialogue inspire Goldstein’s own works. “I want to be able to write like that,” she concludes.</p><p>At school, Goldstein is comfortable associating with people who share similar interests. “It's [...] important to be around people who are passionate about the same things as you,” she observes. “Those are the people you'll want to work with as an adult.”</p><p>For some teens, practice is made easier with the help of a school that puts an emphasis on the arts. LaGuardia sophomore and aspiring singer Jeanne Bransbourg admits, “[since] I sing at school along with many others, it really encourages my passion and helps me get better and feel more comfortable singing.” With a secure group of fellow singers to commiserate and rehearse with, it does make sense that Bransbourg is pushed by her peers to achieve her goals.</p><p>Along with school, an artist’s family can be a deciding factor when it comes to the pursuit of a more creative path, especially during his or her time in high school. We’ve all heard stories of desperate and controlling stage parents that live vicariously through the success of their child. Coming from a musical family, Bransbourg is aware of the benefits of an artistic background, but she doesn’t feel pressured by her parents. Rather than being pushed to get into LaGuardia’s voice program, Bransbourg felt encouraged by her parents to look into many different high schools. “They support me and help me if I need it,” she explains.</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the reasons so many teens are deterred from having a career in the arts is the daunting odds of finding enough success to make a living. “It’s very hard to pursue a career in the arts because only one in a lot of people actually make it,” continues Bransbourg, as she talks about the stresses of her chosen path. The “starving artist” trope exists for a reason, partially because of how many hopeful creatives find themselves working toy jobs to pay the bills as they begin to search for opportunities in their preferred profession.</p><p>On the contrary, Hunter College sophomore Emma Larson reveals that “it often bums [her] out that [Hunter] doesn’t offer as many opportunities to kids wanting to pursue art as opposed to, say, music or [theater].” However, she does find time to draw in her art school’s art class and cartoon club. Her school’s limited options don’t stop her from creating. “My own personal motivation and enjoyment of illustration is what really pushes me to work on my art,” says Larson, explaining how she improves her art without the help of her school.</p><p>When trying to improve and gain attention, many aspiring artists also take to heart the advice they hear from professionals. “Don't worry about getting things perfect,” Real says as she recalls meaningful tips she’s been given. “To keep my options open and to work very very hard,” Bransbourg adds. In the end, most artists find success by staying true to what they know is right for them. “Just draw what [you] love,” Larson says, “because somebody out there loves it too, and you’ll find your own way.”</p>	Article	104	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
745	﻿From Disney to Twerking to “Younger Now” Miley Cyrus’ “Younger Now” is possibly her most recent genuine work to date. <p>Over the past decade, Miley Cyrus has gone through drastic changes, from her innocent teenage “Hannah Montana” days to her controversial, wrecking ball-swinging “Bangerz” era. With her sixth studio album, “Younger Now,” released on September 29, 2017, Cyrus has returned to her country-pop roots in order to reveal a more mature and honest side of her.</p><p>The title track exemplifies Cyrus’s journey in search of her identity. Beginning with a simple country tune on the guitar and the lyrics, “Feels like I’ve just woke up / Like all this time I’ve been asleep / Even though it’s not who I am / I’m not afraid of who I used to be,” the autobiographical song describes how Cyrus’s past identities have helped shape herself and how she embraces her growth. It’s a much more raw self-reflection compared to some of her past songs, such as “Bang Me Box” from “Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz,” a song purely about lesbian sex, or “Do My Thang” from “Bangerz,” an admittedly catchy song in which Cyrus declares her nonchalance towards the public’s opinions on her.</p><p>Though not as powerful as some of Cyrus’s past songs like “The Climb,” “Malibu,” the album’s lead single, is a simple love song dedicated to Cyrus’s fiance, Liam Hemsworth. With just Cyrus’s breezy vocals accompanied by a mid-paced guitar melody, “Malibu” is an innocent, refreshing break from her bolder past of hip-hop and psychedelic songs. As she recalls her memories in Malibu with Hemsworth, her affection for him sounds clear and genuine.</p><p>Love is a powerful theme in Cyrus’s album. Possibly one of the album’s most emotional songs, “She’s Not Him,” depicts Cyrus’s love triangle. Accompanied by gentle strings, she displays her masterful lyricism, singing, “Even though we’ve gone to outer space / Still no way you can take his place.” In a high-pitched, yet soft voice, she regretfully laments that despite her infatuation with her female lover, speculated to be model Stella Maxwell, who Cyrus dated for a brief period of time, Maxwell could never match her true love, Hemsworth.</p><p>While much of the album is rooted in mellow beats and depicts an overall image of a more placid Cyrus, some of the defiant spunk from her more provocative days resurfaces throughout the album. She snarls, “And it’s time for this queen to go and find another throne / When I give it up, I give it all,” in the feisty break-up song “Love Somebody,” and, “It’s getting late, I’m starting to obsess / You got me crying and looking like a mess,” in the infectious rock-based “Thinkin’,” in which Cyrus displays her paranoia and obsession over a lover.</p><p>The album does have its weaker moments, such as “I Would Die For You,” a sweet, tender love ballad that disappoints with its somewhat cheesy and melodramatic lyrics. In addition, “Rainbowland,” a more uplifting, catchy tune featuring Cyrus’s godmother and icon Dolly Parton simply seems unmemorable in comparison to the other intimate tracks.</p><p>However, Cyrus has truly shown her versatility and surprised the public with a much more vulnerable side with “Younger Now.” Let’s just hope she doesn’t revert back to the nudity and sledgehammers.</p>	Article	105	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
746	﻿The Life of Kylie is Killing Reality TV A review of The Life of Kylie <p>Though reality TV has gained a reputation as “trash TV” over the years, many fail to realize that classic shows like “Survivor” and “America’s Got Talent” are also classified as reality TV. Reality TV is an art form in its own right. The idea is to portray real emotions from relatable and lively individuals in an artificial setting, while following a storyline that is fictional enough to be fascinating but real enough to seem genuine. Creating a successful reality TV show requires almost as much, if not more, thought than a fictional TV show, which has the crutch of being fictional. Reality TV is burdened with the task of portraying a reality that isn’t real without being discernibly fake for the entertainment of viewers in a world where there is so much competition for viewers’ attention.</p><p>After appearing on “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” for 10 years, Kylie Jenner is reality TV royalty. It wasn't a surprise when she came forth with her own show, “The Life of Kylie.” Kylie’s aim in starring on this show was to show the other side of her and to differentiate herself from other social media influencers and reality TV stars.</p><p>The content of the show alternates between more structured interviews of Kylie where she is facing the camera and being asked questions such as “Do you want kids?”—to which she duly responds “I do”—and more typical reality TV scenes with her lounging around and hanging out with friends. The transitions between scenes are filled with pictures from Kylie’s social media feeds, including lots of bikini photos. These bright poolside photos with Kylie beaming and laughing with friends feel out of place when juxtaposed with the sober tone of her interviews. Including these visuals also cheapens the production quality of the show because it feels like a 30-minute Snapchat with better camera quality rather than a professional reality show.</p><p>Reality TV thrives on the audience being involved, whether it is allowing the audience to call in and vote for contestants like on “American Idol” or the presence of conflict and petty drama that viewers can become immersed in.</p><p>However, because of a lack of any real conflict, the show is drawn out. Kylie and I were both bored most of the time. To increase viewership, “The Life of Kylie” is planning to add cameos from Kim Kardashian West, subsequently relying on the Kardashian family instead of Kylie standing on her own. The Kardashian family has made an empire out of its reality TV show, so Kylie was trained by the best, yet her show still falls short.</p><p>As stated before, the storyline is barely present. Most of the first two episodes are centered around Kylie surprising a boy named Albert as his date for prom. Kylie says missing her own prom made her "really sad” and unfollowed her friends because she "just couldn’t stand to see" the pictures from prom.</p><p>Kylie introduces a number of characters she calls friends, who the audience does not care about at all. The most interesting thing about most of them is their names. For example, her hair stylist, Tokyo, is good at styling hair. The fact that her “closest” friends are her employees and the absence of any truly dynamic characters makes for a drab cast.</p><p>Kylie also doesn’t play her usual role of reality TV diva when left to her own devices. Her expressions are blank and disinterested for most of the show, contrasting sharply with her jubilant Instagram videos in the transitions.</p><p>While she does attempt to open up, Kylie’s revelations on the show are neither distinctive nor unexpected. When discussing Kylie, W magazine wrote, “How much can you really learn about a person through 12,000+ tweets, 5,000+ Instagram posts, and the most-viewed Snapchat story in the world?” The answer is just about everything. For example, Kylie reveals makeup is her only passion and that she hadn't realized it until she launched her multi-million dollar makeup line. She attempts to garner pity with lines like “I can’t relate to a lot of people. I do feel like an outcast,” but it doesn't feel genuine and it’s hard to feel bad for the girl who has it all.</p><p>Despite the show’s numerous flaws, there are actual lessons that can be learned from it. It becomes glaringly obvious between the transitions filled with Kylie posing in her bikini beaming, and the actual content of the episode, that real life and social media are vastly different, even for someone as affluent and popular as Kylie.</p><p>In producing “The Life of Kylie,” Kylie and her team grossly underestimated the fact that reality TV is an art form in its own right. All the major elements of a good story or TV show also apply to reality TV shows, but they were all neglected. Turning on a camera and posing is for Snapchat and does not belong on TV.

Lynch established that the small screen was an equivalent art medium to the big screen, an absurd notion at the time due to the perception of television shows as senseless distractions for bored housewives.</p><p>Though the series only aired for two seasons after its debut in 1990, it quickly gained a massive cult following, partially because it left so many questions unanswered that viewers began theorizing about hidden messages and motives. However, as any Lynch fan knows, trying to explain the workings of his unique imagination is futile. It is better to simply enjoy its eccentricity and become immersed in Lynch’s surreal, phantasmagoric style.</p><p>The show returned for a long-overdue final season 25 years later this May and was just as impactful the second time around. Despite the changes made from the old “Twin Peaks” to the recent installment, the show has remained true to its origins in terms of its legacy and what it represents.</p><p>Inspired by the film noir of the mid-20th century, Lynch established himself as a pioneer in the world of filmmaking with cult-classic movies such as “Eraserhead” (1977), “The Elephant Man” (1980), and “Blue Velvet” (1986). He gained a reputation for directing chilling, unconventional, and offbeat movies characterized by dreamlike visuals and sporadic use of eerie sound effects. In “Eraserhead,” Lynch depicts a deformed, alien-like infant who makes a distorted mewling noise that sounds terribly similar to a crying baby, yet contains a level of artificiality. There is never a silent moment in his films; a humming or buzzing background noise produces the perpetual feeling of discomfort that is vital to the Lynchian ambience.</p><p>Lynch’s decision to turn to television and create “Twin Peaks” with Mark Frost set a precedent for other legendary filmmakers, like Martin Scorsese, to do the same. His willingness to enter the humble world of TV after several big screen successes conveyed that television could be just as prestigious and artistic as cinema.</p><p>At first glance, “Twin Peaks” is a typical small-town murder mystery in which a beautiful teenage girl dies, and the police begin an investigation to discover the identity of her killer. However, Twin Peaks is no ordinary town. A dark shadow looms over it, and it’s not just from the prostitution rings and drug cartels.</p><p>An evil entity known as Bob has escaped from a part of the spirit world called the Black Lodge to wreak havoc on its residents, who are no strangers to supernatural forces themselves: one character’s soul becomes trapped in a doorknob, and another’s wooden log gives her accurate premonitions of the future. Bob is a physical manifestation of humanity’s darkest dreams and desires, a theme that is prevalent throughout Lynch’s work.</p><p>The characters in the show act in chilling mannerisms that imply a sense of otherworldliness. Even Agent Dale Cooper, protagonist and fan-favorite FBI agent, is a robotic and emotionally void character who is so socially inept that he talks to an invisible “Diane” through a recording device.</p><p>Once, when Cooper is shot and wounded in his hotel room, room service comes in with a glass of milk and oddly neglects the obvious fact that he is bleeding out and dying. This classic Lynchian scene is drawn out in virtual silence between the two characters as the bellhop proceeds to give him his bill and a thumbs-up. Cooper doesn’t seem bothered by his peculiar behavior, nor is he particularly concerned for his own safety.</p><p>From its freakish characters to Cooper’s iconic line “Damn good coffee,” the series has attained a classic status in the entertainment industry, which has made its 2017 return all the more anticipated.</p><p>During the show’s 25-year hiatus, the world changed in a myriad of ways, with the most profound change being technology. Lynch’s style also evolved with time, slowly incorporating the theme of the digital age into his work. There are moments in each episode of the return in which the camera whirs and shakes for a split second. The special effects and CGI in the show are substandard as well. This is a deliberate effort by Lynch to amplify the artificiality and otherworldliness of the world of “Twin Peaks.”</p><p>We are used to seeing science fiction and fantasy TV shows with realistic CGI, and by rejecting this norm, Lynch draws attention to the surrealism of his creation. He was able to keep the original ideas behind “Twin Peaks” intact, but he also accounted for the modernization that occurred in television technology. Lynch’s ability to capture both sides of the spectrum is a testament to his directorial expertise.</p><p>The essence of “Twin Peaks” is not in the individual characters and plot of the show, as is the case for most shows, but in its abstract peculiarity and uniqueness that have been preserved for a quarter-century. Without David Lynch’s masterpiece, shows like “American Horror Story” (2011-present), “Bates Motel” (2013-2017), and “The X-Files” (1993-present) would never have been created.</p><p>His creative genius was ahead of its time and paved the way for the onset of the golden age of American television. “Twin Peaks” is not just a series; it is a concept, an experience, and a dream. Though the show itself seems to be at a definitive end, its legacy will live on for a very long time.</p>	Article	107	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
748	﻿Football’s CTE Crisis In light of the Aaron Hernandez’s CTE reports, CTE is taking even more of a forefront in the NFL.Outquotes:  Going head to head with 300-pound linebackers every week, five months out of the year unsurprisingly takes its toll on the brain. <p>February 5, 2012. Super Bowl XLVI. Third quarter. Tom Brady, New England Patriots’ star quarterback, drops back to pass, scanning the field before firing a tight spiral to his 6’1”, 245-pound tight end Aaron Hernandez. He catches it at the seven yard line and muscles his way into the end zone to increase his team’s lead to 17-9. He dances in the end zone, raising his arms to the roaring crowd. Even though the Patriots ended up losing the game, Hernandez goes for eight catches and 67 yards and inks a five-year, $40 million extension with the Patriots that offseason.</p><p>Five years later, Aaron Hernandez was found hanging from his bedsheets in Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, MA. He was two years into a life sentence without parole for the first degree murder of Odin Lloyd. To the world, he is a cautionary tale—one of a young player who let fame get to his head and killed someone in cold blood over a trivial issue. Besides the murder of Lloyd, Hernandez was also accused, but acquitted, in the murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. All of this paints a bleak picture of Hernandez, and while he was not a good person, there is more to this case than meets the eye.</p><p>Yes, Hernandez murdered in cold blood. Yes, he deserved life in prison for the atrocities he committed. However, it recently has come to light that Hernandez was suffering from Stage 3 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This is the most severe case ever seen in a person at such a young age.</p><p>Because of this, the Hernandez family is suing the Patriots and the league, citing that they knew the risks for Hernandez but still kept them from him. The case will no doubt remain in the legal system for the foreseeable future, but besides Hernandez, there have been and will be many others with a CTE diagnosis.</p><p>Posing a major threat to the National Football League (NFL), this CTE problem needs to be addressed and corralled before it brings the NFL down. A complete reform of the sport is neither needed nor wanted, but more studies about what specifically causes CTE, along with more player awareness programs and increased neurological checks, would go a long way to quench players’ fears and potentially save the sport.</p><p>CTE is a degenerative brain disorder that is characterized by a buildup of the Tau protein, which slowly kills brain cells. It takes thousands of hits and enough of them, concussive or otherwise, to cause CTE. This makes football players especially susceptible: going head to head with 300-pound linebackers every week, five months out of the year unsurprisingly takes its toll on the brain.</p><p>However, one of the main reasons this remains an issue is that it can only be diagnosed post-mortem. Symptoms such as memory loss, social impairment, and eventually dementia or depression can often be a symptom, but nothing definitive can be done prior to death.</p><p>For a while, the NFL avoided this issue. It wouldn’t bring it up or admit that there is a link between football and degenerative brain issues. Even after players such as Junior Seau, a 12-time Pro Bowler, committed suicide in 2012, or Lou Creekmur, eight-time Pro Bowler, had autopsies that proved he had CTE, the NFL didn’t budge, stating that it would wait on more concrete studies.</p><p>The league went as far as to dismiss findings that the Golden-Globe nominated movie “Concussion” (2015) portrayed. It reflects on the work of Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian pathologist who found that former NFL player Mike Webster’s brain was severely damaged. He went on to conduct studies on other NFL players and found similar results. When he attempted to present his findings to Commissioner Roger Goodell, the league refused to even listen to him. However, after numerous cases and a 2017 study from the Journal of the American Medical Association that found 110 of the 111 former players’ brains studied had CTE, the NFL was forced to change its tune.</p><p>To keep players’ families from suing the NFL, it reached a $1 billion plus concussion settlement in 2013 that pays out upwards of $5 million to each family for a variety of injuries post-football. A CTE-related death is worth $4 million under the current agreement.</p><p>However, even after this influx of data on CTE was introduced, the NFL did nothing to restructure the settlement and increase the payout. Financial compensation to players’ families can only come after years of which suffering players and their loved ones had to cope with the disease. Pain should be worth more than $4 million.</p><p>Another issue for the NFL is the growing number of current players that are retiring before the age of 35 to preserve their mental capacities to live longer and healthier lives. Chris Borland (age 24), A.J. Tarpley (Age 23), and D’Brickashaw Ferguson (age 32) all hung up the cleats before they were forced out, citing heightened awareness of the risks posed in the NFL as factors. If more well-known players continue to retire at young ages, the NFL may lose billions in revenue.</p><p>These new, high profile dropouts have pushed the NFL to change rules to limit high-impact collisions, most-notably being the move of touchbacks from the 20-yard line to 25. This makes teams less likely to return kickoffs and collide with each other after gaining 50 feet or more of momentum, thereby limiting some of the more brutal head-on hits in the sport. This rule change, among others, is a start for the NFL. While it is impossible to eradicate head injuries in such a high-contact sport, the league can take steps like this to limit the most direct hits.</p><p>The Hernandez case is the most sensational one yet. He was one of the most recent players to have been in the league, so his play is still fresh in people's minds. However, as more studies come out proving other players’ brain issues, and I’m positive they will, the fans will begin to turn on the NFL as their childhood stars slowly go out both mentally and physically.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, the NFL needs to get in front of the issue by openly discussing it and funding research to prevent such severe damage.</p><p>I’m not advocating for a complete overhaul of the NFL. Much like millions of other Americans, my Sundays are spent switching from game to game and checking my fantasy lineups. To change the basic rules of the sport would be a travesty. However, this CTE issue is not going away, and more steps need to be taken to limit its place in football. Studies that attempt to decipher which types of hits lead to a higher CTE risk and compare the general population’s risk of CTE to that of a football player’s will go a long way in minimizing this problem.</p>	Article	115	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
749	﻿Boys’ Fencing Remain Undefeated  <p>Senior and co-captain of the boys’ fencing team, Max Chan, faced off against one of Long Island City’s top fencers. Chan evaded his opponent’s attacks while landing multiple back flicks, which involved bending the blade to touch the opponent. The team prevailed with a 90-30 victory.</p><p>Currently gunning for the 16th straight undefeated season, each Stuyvesant fencer has recorded five touches and allowed only two Long Island City fencers to reach five, limiting most to one to two touches. Stuyvesant sits at the top of its division after winning the first four games of the season. “We’ve fenced a few games so far and have been winning by huge margins, like 90-15, 90-18, etc,” Chan said. An opponent has yet to come within 50 points of Stuyvesant, another testament to the team’s dominance.</p><p>These victories are not unexpected to the members of the team. “Our practices are some of the most rigorous you'll find, both mentally and physically. Fencing really is a combination of both physical and mental dexterity. That's why it's sometimes referred to as ‘Physical Chess,’” Chan said. Practices are where teams gain the mindset and technique to compete in games, and their practices have been guiding the team to this undefeated season.</p><p>Coach Joel Winston’s mentoring attitude for the members of his team have helped them all flourish this season. “He helps us a lot with improving our fencing, but apart from that, he’s also very encouraging and helps us grow closer as a team,” senior and co-captain Jerome Freudenberg said.</p><p>Beside the Stuyvesant practices, another key reason for this high level of play is the amount of time the starters are putting into the sport. “A lot of our fencers fence outside of school during the off-season so we have a considerable advantage. We have a more dedicated team than most others,” Freudenberg said. These include all six starters: Chan, Freudenberg, senior and co-captain Thompson Hui, seniors Eric Zhang and Benny He, and sophomore Tazman Libson. These six have a combined 47-2 record so far this year. By fencing outside of Stuyvesant, the players compete more often than other players on opposing teams. “Normally, schools have just one or two good fencers who fence at club and who carry the whole team, but this year we have a whole starting lineup of them,” Chan said.</p><p>At 4-0 and coming off 15 undefeated regular seasons, the fencing team has high hopes for the rest of its season. Led by a strong senior class, an undefeated record is definitely a possibility for the team. Even beyond the regular season, the team definitely has the ability to go deep into the playoffs and possibly win a championship. “Of course, everything just comes down to that one day,” Chan said. “But I trust my team, my co-captains, and I am confident we can succeed at playoffs this year.”</p>	Article	119	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
750	﻿Coulrophobia Be Damned “It” brings the traditional exploitation of fear to the table along with some unexpected humor and soul. <p>“Do you need to be a virgin to see this [expletive deleted] clown?!” is one of many wisecracks in the highly anticipated film remake of Stephen King’s chilling novel. Directed by Andy Muschietti, “It” is an adaptation of the first chapter of King’s book of the same name, which follows a gang of ‘80s kids from the small town of Derry, Maine, as they hunt for a mysterious, terrifying, soul-eating creature that has been kidnapping children. The film is innovative in its ability to combine just the right amount of jump scares with a dose of pubescent humor, along with a curious exploitation of fear. Nobody is safe from Pennywise, the immortal, blood-curdling, psychopathic jester. “It” contains all the qualities of a standard horror film interspersed with classic elements of ‘80s nostalgia.</p><p>Pennywise, played by Bill Skarsgård, emerges every 27 years to terrorize children and feeds on their fear by wolfing down their souls. The focus of the film is Bill Denbrough (Jaeden Lieberher), a shy, stuttering boy on a quest to find his little brother Georgie (Jackson Robert Scott), who is kidnapped by the murderous clown. Bill blames himself and enlists his misfit friends, Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), Richie (Finn Wolfhard), and Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer). On their journey, they meet Beverly (Sophia Lillis), Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), and Mike (Chosen Jacobs), and are deemed the “Losers’ Club” by the neighborhood bullies. The group confronts Pennywise several times and discovers his horrifying shapeshifting abilities. Along with his ability to rotate his body parts in a very unhuman-like way, the clown’s head constantly morphs into that of each child’s nightmare. The clown transforms into a misshapen woman from a painting Stanley walks past in fear at the synagogue and, similarly, becomes a leper to terrorize hypochondriac Eddie on his way home.</p><p>The movie seamlessly integrates its characters’ fears into the storyline and gives each character a purpose. Some of the characters’ fears are so subtly presented that they aren’t noticeable until Pennywise embraces those fears and exploits them. Oftentimes, the most candid or tranquil moments were the ones that gave each character more backstory, such as when Mike refuses to kill lambs at his family’s farm. It doesn’t seem important at first, but the scene later becomes evidence of Mike’s fear of death and slaughter. Beverly stands out as the gutsy lone girl in the group and exudes an aura of self-confidence, but is haunted by her period and her abusive father. Eddie constantly rattles off his worries about contamination at a breakneck pace, while Richie continually digresses from the topic at hand with wisecracks and innuendos.</p><p>Of course, the ever-present villain in the film is the killer clown and its appearances throughout the plot instill terror in both the gang and the audience. Cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung’s mastery of the camera is effective in making Pennywise’s screen time terrifying. Chung sweeps from frame to frame with angles that emphasize the film’s contrasting themes of terror and mellowness, including one particularly terrifying fish-eyed close-up of Pennywise getting ready to bite Eddie’s head off. Chung succeeds in making Pennywise’s appearances so random and wholly unexpected that the audience members are left falling off of their chairs in dread of the clown’s next arrival. There were many times when I  covered my eyes in panic, as if that could protect me.</p><p>Keeping time with Chung is composer Benjamin Wallfish’s rich orchestral melodies and sinister nursery rhymes that punctuate the more frightening aspects of the film but also highlight moments of fun and resolution. Morbid tunes play as Ben flips through a book about Old Derry’s dark past, finally crescendoing into a fast-paced and urgent refrain that follows Ben as he runs from a headless victim of Pennywise’s attacks. The sharp jump in the music as the corpse appeared caused the entire crowd in the theatre to suck in its breath. The orchestra swells as the movie finally fades out to show the group of children reflecting on their assault of Pennywise later in the film.</p><p>In addition to the film’s ability to scare viewers, “It” also breaks standard horror film expectations. Instead of back-to-back jump scares, the movie utilizes its characters’ young ages to bring a nostalgic humor from the days when bad puberty jokes were common. Despite the dangers Pennywise poses, the kids still enjoy their summer fun and even find time for a wild rock battle with the neighborhood bully, accompanied with appropriate heavy metal music. The film even goes so far as to be meta, like when Richie is wowed by Bill not stuttering once during an impromptu speech. Though Richie’s sex jokes are sometimes a bit much, the movie tries to be unconventional by mixing the scary and the funny.</p><p>While “It” may not be the scariest movie out there, it is definitely capable of making audiences both laugh and cover their eyes in terror. The film balances themes of friendship and loyalty with recurring gore and suspense, creating a product that is as thrilling as anticipated, but also lets viewers root for the protagonists as they embark on their heroic journey. As most of us know, fear can’t be overcome overnight, so we hope to see more from the “Losers’ Club” in the future.</p>	Article	103	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
751	﻿Seniors Forget About Halloween Seniors forget about Halloween and believe their school has become haunted. <p>TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31ST. On what would most likely be the spookiest day of the year, ghouls, zombies, and scariest of all, Former Assistant Principal of Family Affairs and Student Engagement and Current Assistant Principal of Safety, Security, Student Affairs, Health, and Physical Education Brian Moran roamed the streets of Tribeca.</p><p>However, despite the particularly frightening transformation of Stuyvesant High School’s student body, one group was distinctly normal. After a long week of desperate procrastination and sleepless nights full of League of Legends, the seniors were suffering from symptoms of first stage senioritis. Unfortunately, their horrors had just begun; they had less than 24 hours to complete their college applications or else they would die.</p><p>After receiving his daily fix of caffeine from the breakfast cart, senior Anthony Guan blinked, confused by the mob of supernatural creatures and cats in front of him. “Oh no, I knew I should have kept going to church,” Guan whispered, his face white as he stared into the back of the Devil. “Hold up, I need some more coffee,” he decided. The stimulatory drug, however, did little to clear Guan’s fears of the sudden invasion by supernatural creatures, which, unbeknownst to him, were being repeated in the minds of every senior heading to school that morning.</p><p>Seniors all around the school had forgotten about Halloween after being so swamped with work, and were consequently frightened for their lives. “I walked into AP Gov an-and Ms. Siegel had turned into Bloody Mary! She grinned at me with bloodstained teeth and I was out of that room immediately,” a senior cried hysterically. “I tried to see my guidance counselor, but she had become an incarnation of Satan too!” The entire day was filled with screams and shouts of terror as seniors seeked refuge from the deadly monsters now plaguing the school. Because all their teachers had been replaced with monsters, they took the situation as a valid excuse to cut.</p><p>“I wonder where the real Polazzo went,” voiced a worried senior. “That beardless man must’ve kidnapped him and took his place!”</p><p>The security guards tried to instill order, but had, for the first year ever, decided to forgo their traditional uniforms to do a group vampire costume. Every time they chased down a senior, trying to bring them back to class, they were sprayed with garlic cloves and fountain water, and thrust upon with crosses, all generously donated by the Stuyvesant Anti-Vampire Club. Senior Adam Abbas converted a NERF gun that he bravely confiscated from Moran into a pencil stake shooter, but never used it since he had barricaded himself in the Robotics room anyway.</p><p>The underclassmen, though confused, took advantage of the situation by frightening seniors to the point of utter terror, only releasing them after extracting confidential school secrets, such as the location of the 11th floor pool. The administration, however, was not happy with the occurrence. Principal Eric Contreras, dressed as the “It” clown, expressed his frustration: “I thought clowns were supposed to be funny, so why is everyone running away from me?” The attendance office was especially annoyed after receiving 800 class excuse notices the following morning, citing “a demonic invasion of the supernatural.”</p>	Article	110	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
752	﻿Student Surprised by Angery Reaccs on Post of Exact Grades A Stuy student is genuinely surprised when people attack him for posting his exact grades on facebook. <p>When AP course selections came out, junior Max Lobel was shocked to see that he was not accepted into AP Whining, his dream class. After complaining for a solid 17 minutes, during which any onlooker would have immediately suggested that AP Whining was the perfect class for Lobel, he ran to his computer and began to type out a request for help in the form of a Facebook post. “I have a 97.785 science average, a 98 overall average, a 96 English average, I got all A’s in third grade, and my mommy says I’m her ‘widdle smartie pants’; why didn’t I get into AP Whining?” read the post in the “Dear Incoming Class of 2018…We Have Advice but Only at Useless Times and Not When You Actually Need It” Facebook group.</p><p>To Max’s surprise, instead of helpful comments, his post received hundreds of angery reaccs and responses. “I didn’t understand why people were attacking me. I didn’t do anything wrong. It’s not like I tried to create a StuyJoust event or anything,” Lobel said.</p><p>These angry responses, which ranged from “Whom’st’ve’d’th man’s,” to “Welcome to your tape,” sparked a series of Facebook posts from different Stuyvesant students attacking Lobel, supporting Lobel, attacking the Lobel supporters, supporting the Lobel attackers, attacking the Lobel attacker’s attackers, and asking for people to stop posting by making their own unnecessary posts.</p><p>Somehow surprised by the reaction to his post, Lobel tried to defend his decision to share his exact grades. “Why would I make this post to brag? So what if I have a 99.39397 in math, a 97.666 in history, and a 100 in physics? This post was definitely NOT an attempt for me to make up for my lack of social skills by getting people to like me for my 99 average!” said Lobel, while also “accidentally” changing his profile picture to a screenshot of his average with the caption, “Oops, wrong photo!”</p><p>In the end, the program office saw Lobel’s Facebook posts and his extraordinary talent to complain, which fulfills all pre-reqs, and accepted him into his dream class of AP Whining.</p>	Article	160	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
827	﻿Behind the Scenes: Cheerleading With the support of new Coach Nicholas O’Stanton and one goal in mind, Stuyvesant’s underrated cheerleaders are working harder and are more determined than ever. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>For years, television has presented stereotypes that have defined cheerleading, causing us to conjure up the image of girly, shallow, popular mean girls. It’s easy to tell who’s a cheerleader because she’ll always have her uniform on. After school, cheerleading practice (that takes place after hours of preening in the bathroom) just consists of waving pom poms for an hour while looking pretty. But who could blame them. It’s not even a real sport.</p><p>All these stereotypes exist even at Stuyvesant to a certain degree; most students didn’t even know there was a cheerleading team until they were at the football homecoming game.</p><p>But this year, there is an unprecedented growth in the number of people joining cheerleading. A lot of the new members of the team are our high-achieving friends, often making us wonder what compelled them to join.</p><p><b>Challenging Stereotypes: Building a New Reputation</b></p><p>In the past, cheerleading didn’t have the best name. “Though I wasn't on cheer my freshman year, I know that there was a lot of issues with the team,” junior Xinyue Nam added. “Last year, the coach didn’t really try to grow the cheer team, and we didn’t go to competitions. We depended on the football team. We are so much more than just pretty girls, and guys, waving pom poms while shouting, ‘Let's go Stuy.’”</p><p>A lot of the cheerleaders had difficulty being able to have their parents respect their decision to join the team. Cheerleading is a costly sport that is underfunded and overlooked because of the team’s lack of success in the past. “Cheerleading is very expensive and it hurts that people don’t respect us. A lot of people have to pay for their cheer costs and our parents aren’t on board with things,” Nam revealed.</p><p>This lack of support causes many Stuyvesant cheerleaders to obtain money from after school jobs in order to stay on the team.</p><p>Furthermore, the commitment required to be a cheerleader is unanticipated and can cause a strain on a cheerleader’s social life. “To be honest, because I spent a lot of time in practice and other cheer-related events, I haven’t been able to spend much time with my friends. I think that they fully support me being on cheer, but sometimes, it’s hard to not talk to them for several days because I’m so busy with it on top of schoolwork and other clubs,” sophomore Angelina Chu said.</p><p>Now, with good advertising and people involved with Student Union on the team, the  influx of new members this year is challenging the typical stereotypes of what it means to be a cheerleader.</p><p>“Clearly, if we’re at Stuyvesant, I think you can tell that we don’t fit the stereotype,” senior Patricia Tan commented. Many members take AP classes and are involved in ARISTA, proving they still have the GPA to be at the top of their class.</p><p>In addition, cheerleading isn’t just waving pom poms around, because strength is a necessity for all the teammates. “You’re not just dancing and trying to look good,” sophomore and flyer Theresa Teng explained. “Especially if you are one of those people on the bottom, and you’re literally lifting people up. You need to be strong. We condition just like other teams.”</p><p>On the other hand, male cheerleaders are often labeled as gay. But junior Xinyue Nam has been on the cheerleading team since her first year at Stuyvesant, and she understands the crucial role of males like junior Kevin Zong on the team. “They are the glue of the team,” Nam said. “Our guys don't care about the stereotypes. It gets annoying, but we know these things.”</p><p><b>A Bond for Success</b></p><p>The bond that the team has can be clearly seen. “Cheer is really emotionally stressful sometimes, and I feel that a huge reason as to why we are so close is because we always somehow overcome the obstacles,” Zong said.</p><p>As we walk into the third floor atrium after tenth period, we see the cheerleaders warming up and practicing their impressive stunts. The beginning of typical practice doesn't stray far from an average baseball or football practice: stretching and warming up. These are necessary steps every athlete, including cheerleaders, must take in order to prevent injuries. During warmups, cheerleaders can be seen running laps around the school and reinforcing positive motivation to get each other through the tiresome workout. Afterwards, the members break off into their respective stunt groups and go straight to work. Many stunts are dangerous and consist of flyers getting lifted up into the air by the bases and backs supporting them. Typically, the male cheerleaders are at the base.</p><p>“We try to clean our dances, our cheers, and also work on new stunting skills to incorporate within our routine for Nationals,” Zong described. With improvement in stunts, flyers are learning how to do more intricate and difficult routines just in time for Nationals. For example, in a high to low tick tock, the flyer has to switch legs and end up standing on the opposite leg with the other leg bent.</p><p>Zong plays an extremely crucial role because he is one of seven males on the team. Being the “back” of routines, he's responsible for literally lifting up his teammates, a feat the average person cannot do. Before joining the team, Zong initially joined the PSAL Stunt team due to a friend recommending it. When Cheer season came around, he saw no reason to leave the family. “Cheer has become such a huge part of my life. I dedicate myself to it because I want to be part of something great,” Zong explained.</p><p><b>New Coach, New Goals, New Cheer</b></p><p>The introduction of Coach Nicholas O’Stanton has proven to have given the team more opportunities. Because Stuyvesant’s team wasn’t the only commitment the former coach had, he would only be able to come to one out of every few practices and didn’t allow stunting while he was absent. “Coach Nick comes to every practice, so we really have been able to progress in terms of stunts and skills. He really fosters our ability to prepare and set goals,” Tan explained.</p><p>A major change under Coach O’Stanton is the addition of a Junior Varsity (JV) team. “They tried to implement it last year, but it didn’t really work. This year, we have a total of over 50 people, which means we can definitely split it into Varsity and JV.” Tan said. If JV acquires the skill, they will also be competing at these competitions, but in their own division. In addition, with a new JV division, the team is a lot more organized.</p><p>This implementation is providing positive results rather than negative ones. Rather than unhealthy competition, the addition of a JV team is a providing a stronger team bond. “Many of the JV members are working hard to earn a spot in Varsity. I think that this helps motivate us and strive to always be the best that we can be,” Zong explained. Members in JV are with people that have similar skills and can help each other grow.</p><p>The greater opportunities for people to become more involved in cheer has led to the evolution of the team’s reputation because it is a lot more inclusive. In addition, cheerleading is attractive because it has so many members and radiates a sense of community to whoever might be interested in joining. The team’s growing integration into Stuyvesant’s culture can be seen with the performance at the pep rally as well as the creation of a future cheer club.</p><p>In addition to making them physically stronger, cheerleading challenges them mentally. Members have to dedicate themselves to improving and ignoring the judgement they receive on their physical appearances.  At competitions, members are evaluated on both their skill and physical appearance in front of large crowds. The long and frequent practices don’t ease this either because it adds a great deal of stress with a huge time commitment.</p><p>In prior years,  the team never competed at official competitions, so members are very excited because they’re focused on literally throwing people up in the air. The Stuyvesant High School Cheerleading Team will be competing at Regionals, hoping to bid there and get to the ultimate dream: Nationals.With the new coach, members finally have a target to aim for. “Coach Nick actually set [goals] in stone. ‘We’re going to Nationals,’ ‘This is the date we want to go to,’ so we’ve been working up to that goal of going to Nationals so far since the summer,” Tan said. “The idea of people taking us seriously at Stuyvesant once they hear that we bid at Regionals and potentially [go] to Nationals is a good thing to me.”</p><p>Currently, the team is already preparing to go to Nationals in Orlando around Christmas break of this year.</p><p><b>Moving Forward: Together as a Family</b></p><p>Reflecting on her past three years on the team, senior and captain Michelle Moe is</p><p>excited for the team’s upcoming season. “I’m looking forward to taking my team to Nationals, if we bid at Regionals,” Moe said. “I look forward to sharing the experience that a lot of cheerleaders across the country dream of with my favorite people.”</p><p>“I know that we have the potential to become great,” Zong said with enthusiasm. “So this year, I hope to take the ‘in’ out of ‘infamous’ and rise above what others think of us.”</p>	Article	225	2017-11-30 09:28:08.70121	2017-11-30 10:33:22.968994
633	Jeremy Rynders Replaces Randi Damesek as AP of Organization Randi Damesek resigned from her position of Assistant Principal of Organization and has been replaced by Jeremy Rynders. <p>To find a replacement for Damesek, Contreras reached out to a few colleagues. “[Rynders] was highly recommended by trusted colleagues, including [Damesek],” Contreras said.</p><p>Contreras values Rynders’ experience and understanding of Stuyvesant culture and believes these qualities made him stand out from the other candidates. “He has six years of experience doing operations, so he knows all the systems, from [human resources] to budget,” Contreras said. “I felt that he scripted in his [application] letter some of the larger understanding of the student body [such as] the reference of the desire to go to the moon, and we have many students here [with] equivalent ambitions [...] to do something bigger than themselves. And he understood that unique part of Stuyvesant.”</p><p>Rynders feels honored to be selected as the new AP of Organization and is eager for the school year to start. “Stuyvesant is a place where the sky's the limit when it comes to what students will achieve, and I'm excited to be a part of that,” he said.</p><p>At the same time, Rynders is also aware of the challenges he will have to face. “Stuyvesant is a large and dynamic school that demands someone be able to consider the needs of a great number of competing priorities,” Rynders said. “I hope to be a school leader that people will see as responsive, resourceful, and fair.”</p><p>During this upcoming school year, Rynders hopes to build a relationship with the students, staff, and parents. “I believe those relationships are essential to the effective execution of my duties, but I acknowledge that [it] is no small task with a student body of 3,500 young people,” he said.</p><p>Rynders has yet to go through the Chancellor’s Regulation C-30—a process that regulates the selection of APs—to be appointed as a permanent AP of Organization. “I had the option to bring in Rynders immediately [with] a C-30, but I choose to not [to] in the absence of all [the administrators]. I like to hear everyone else’s voice and opinion,” Contreras said.</p><p>Later this year, Contreras will issue a post for the permanent AP of Organization position. Candidates like Rynders will be able to apply and will have to go through the C-30 process, which includes an interview with the School Leadership Team—a council of student, parent, and faculty representatives.</p><p>Contreras does not expect the change in administration to affect the student body.  “[People] come and go, but one constant is the brilliance of our students, and that’s what makes Stuy a very special place. The work of adults will always be significant, but our defining piece is how we support the brilliant hardworking ambition of our student body. And that is what is most important, regardless of who’s name is to that title,” Contreras said.</p>	Article	1	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
634	﻿Tahseen Chowdhury on Campaigning for State Senate To explain Tahseen Chowdhury’s decision to run for the position of State State and talk about his political history. <p>Student Union (SU) President Tahseen Chowdhury has always been a force to be reckoned with—confidently swaggering down the hallway as if he owns the place. And, to the Stuyvesant student body, he very well may.</p><p>Though Chowdhury is part of a “dynasty” of students who worked their way up the political ladder, going from Freshman Caucus president to SU president, he has always fought against becoming another cog in the wheel of SU inefficiency.</p><p>“Two or three years ago, we were going down a route where the SU would be bankrupt by the middle of my senior year if I hadn’t stepped in and stabilized the budget,” he said.  Since Chowdhury first became involved with school politics in the seventh grade, he has always sought to take concrete action.</p><p>This year, Chowdhury decided to take his political activism to the next level. He will be running for the position of State Senate for District 13, which is comprised of Jackson Heights, Corona, and East Elmhurst, in the 2018 election. As a state senator, Chowdhury would be responsible for writing, proposing, and voting on new legislation.</p><p>With these opportunities, Chowdhury believes that he will be able to positively impact not only his district, but also the entire state of New York. “I love sitting in a law library and finding ways to implement new ideas within the structures that exist. I believe I'll be able to take ideas and turn them into bills that'll benefit the community as a whole,” he said in an e-mail interview. “I also genuinely believe I'm a good candidate because of my lack of experience. I'm a fresh face in New York politics.”</p><p>He will be running against incumbent Senator Jose Peralta, who Chowdhury believes didn’t actually follow through with the promises made in his platform. In particular, Chowdhury is dissatisfied with the senator’s choice to align himself with the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), a group of eight senators. He labels the IDC as a wolf in sheep’s clothing— ready to use the “Democrat” label to gain votes all the while obstructing the passage of progressive policies in the state senate.</p><p>Chowdhury’s disdain toward the IDC began to develop as he worked alongside Senator and member of the IDC Jesse Hamilton in 2016. “[Hamilton and I] wanted to propose and pass a piece of legislation that would reconstruct the panel [that decides on] educational policy. I felt that students should have the ability to advocate for what they want to see in the Department of Education,” Chowdhury said. Despite his attempt at empowering New York’s student body, he was shut out and ignored. Hamilton’s contact with him ceased altogether afterward.</p><p>Once Donald Trump was elected and Peralta had been accepted into the IDC, Chowdhury immediately began to think about what could be done.“It was really unsettling to me because the IDC was literally empowering Republicans in a way that the Republicans really shouldn’t be empowered,” he said.</p><p>Therefore, Chowdhury’s platform features a progressive outlook on issues ranging from affordable housing and safe streets to a legal defense fund for undocumented immigrants and “desegregation” in public schools. It highlights a comprehensive educational policy with an emphasis on student representation. One of Chowdhury’s proposed legislations even gives students the right to vote on the panel for educational reform.</p><p>He also proposes numerous changes that he believes would benefit the environment, such as a plastic bag tax and the creation of a task force dedicated to installing bike racks. Additionally, he hopes to bolster affordable health care and protect senior citizens by regulating nurse-to-patient ratios.</p><p>“New York is one of the most progressive states,” Chowdhury said. “If someone is going to think ‘progressive,’ they should think ‘New York.’ If someone is going to think ‘democratic’ they should think ‘New York.’”</p><p>Not only does Chowdhury believe he knows more about his community than Peralta does, but he also believes that he’s just as qualified of a candidate in other aspects. “[My experiences at Stuyvesant will] play a major role in actual politics because I understand how people operate,” he said. “I can sit down and think about the administration's perspective. I can also think about the students’ perspective and find a point where both perspectives meet. I’m sure I’ll be able to do this at the state level as well.”</p><p>Presently, Chowdhury’s campaigning has not officially started. However, he has been focusing on preparation for when his campaigning officially begins in March 2018. Being present on social media, engaging with his community about various issues, and fundraising is Chowdhury’s current priority. He has made attending anti-IDC and progressive rallies with fellow student volunteers a common ritual. “We go to rallies to talk to people and figure out what people think about and care about. I’m always excited about people caring about these issues,” he said.</p><p>In fact, this grassroots type campaigning was inspired by that of former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.“One of the things Bernie Sanders told us was that we have to make sure that young people are running for office in their home states and home districts because we have to make sure that we are rising and resisting anywhere and everywhere we can,” he said.</p><p>Despite often being criticized for running before he’s even had the ability to vote, Chowdhury firmly maintains that no one is ever too young to get involved. “I've always been someone who likes to do things people might argue I'm a little too young for, whether that be starting a nonprofit, running a business, or running for office,” he said in an e-mail interview. “If you want to get active, just do it. It really is scary to put yourself out there, but it’s also most important that you advocate for your community.”</p><p>While most seniors are bombarded by the stress of the college application process and look forward to second semester as a time to blow off some steam, Chowdhury’s 2017-2018 school year will look quite different. “The election is after my senior year, but the campaign will take up the bulk of my second term. I'm excited for second term because this is a challenge that I think I can tackle. I'm limited to applying to colleges in NYC but that's something I'm completely fine with. New York is a great place and I'm ready to make sure that we make it better,” he said.</p><p>Chowdhury would like to thank the Stuyvesant community for rooting for him when he announced his candidacy. “I like to take everything I learn and apply it to the SU, so if anything, this campaign will allow me to improve my work within the SU. I don't think there's any way for it to negatively affect me,” he said.”Without a doubt, I would not be able to hold this together without the support I have from the community.”</p>	Article	2	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
635	﻿Share Your Story: The Legacy of 9/11 Sixteen years ago today, a tragedy struck the United States and had an especially large impact on New York City and Stuyvesant. Since our 9/11... <p>Sixteen years ago today, a tragedy struck the United States and had an especially large impact on New York City and Stuyvesant. Since our 9/11 Magazine was published, The Spectator has written countless pieces in commemoration. Today, we want to let your stories do the telling.</p><p>Responses have been condensed and edited for clarity.</p><p>“Don't remember where [or] when, but I saw this thing where it said whenever [the clock] hits 9:11, the person would stay silent and contemplate for a moment. That's about as much of a connection you can get from me. I think about it, but I have no strong emotions about it like my mother and father do. Where they are from, Muslims aren't thought of very kindly, to put it nicely. Especially now, when the country is dealing with some problems involving Muslims, it just makes this gap a bit bigger. I have not been raised with suspicion against certain groups and [have not] been so close to a terrorist attack myself, but I do understand one thing: it has changed everything. So, I guess it isn't history, but I can't say I think about it often.” —Anonymous, sophomore</p><p>“My dad was a police officer and helped clean up the debris after the attacks. Every year, on 9/11, he reminds me of the many NYPD and FDNY responders who passed away, and it makes me appreciate having my father still with me today.” —William Hong, senior</p><p>“I definitely feel like there is a divide between the generation that experienced 9/11 (even if they weren't actually in New York to see it) and the generation that was born in the years afterward. Whenever [I try to] have rational arguments about the Iraq War, my elders are always able to say, ‘Well you weren't there. You didn't know what it was like.’ It's an emotionally charged event, and those who didn't live through [it] lose the ethos to be able to discuss it with those who did.” —Julian Giordano, freshman</p><p>“As a Muslim, I believe that it has shaped people's perception of me unfairly. They may not be as kind or may expect something different of me just based on my faith. They may expect me to be aggressive or menacing. They view me as a threat. And, as a Muslim woman, they may expect me to be passive. The problem is with all of this. None of these things are true.” —Fariya Farah, sophomore</p><p>“Bush's response [to 9/11] was ill-formed and misdirected and created more hate in and out of the United States. There was absolutely no reason for the United States to attack Iraq; Iraq was a fall-guy for Saudi Arabia, the country from which the terrorists actually came. George W. was settling a personal vendetta between his father and Iraq.”  —Eve Wening, sophomore</p><p>“I believe his response was justified. Too little action and the American people would complain of ‘Bush the Pacifist.’ Too much, well, you can never have too much action against a war that truly affects the American people. We achieved great influence over the Middle East, having such a large military presence in Afghanistan and Iraq. Also, it set the platform for the dismantling of ISIL, which is crumbling as we speak.” —Eric Shau, sophomore</p><p>“I hear insulting remarks every day when I used to wear the hijab and the jokes revolving around me involved 9/11 and Al Qaeda. I responded with laughter, of course. Now I don't wear it for personal reasons, but some of it is because of those remarks.” —Anonymous, junior</p><p>“[If 9/11 had not happened], Trump would not have gotten elected. People have always been scared of the relative unknown, and Trump capitalized on that fear.”  —Meril Mousoom, freshman</p><p>“In many ways it united us, even though we don't feel very united at the moment. We also know what terrorists are capable of and want to do. In another way, it created a lot of tension toward the Muslim community that is shaping current political stances.” —Camille Sadoff, sophomore</p>	Article	4	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
636	﻿David Peng: Transition From Student to Teacher “Oh my God, I just failed the Peng test,” someone whispers in the hall, his face gaunt with fear. Almost every Thursday, geometry teacher David... <p>“Oh my God, I just failed the Peng test,” someone whispers in the hall, his face gaunt with fear. Almost every Thursday, geometry teacher David Peng’s students are put on trial. At the end of the period, students funnel out of the third floor halls; commotion erupts as students scatter nervously out of the classroom with worry written all over their faces.</p><p>At Stuyvesant, Peng is notorious for his difficult geometry class. While he isn’t fully aware of the tough, hardcore reputation he has amongst his students, Peng admits that he strives to push and prepare students to the best of his ability.</p><p>As an alumnus of 2006, Peng can certainly relate to the joys, struggles, and pressures that Stuyvesant students face.</p><p>Peng admits that he was not the best student, but rather was very average with a strong interest in math. “In middle school, I performed on a high level. I was on the math team and did well in scholastic competitions. Once I got to Stuy, I felt others were ahead of me [and] much smarter and much more hardworking than me,” Peng described.</p><p>During his two years teaching at Stuyvesant, Peng has observed students facing the same difficult transition that he made. “Kids realize that this isn't a walk in the park. This is Stuy,” Peng said. “Students have this moment of realization that they need to get their act together. Some students realize that right away, for some of them it takes one exam, for some it takes the whole semester, and some still have not realized it yet!”</p><p>Peng’s parents valued education and made it their goal to make sure their son got into Stuyvesant. “It was not easy for my parents to afford test prep, especially since we came from humble beginnings,” Peng said. “Looking back, I really appreciate their sacrifices.”</p><p>Once he got into Stuyvesant, Mr. Peng noticed that his parents backed off. The mindset was that Peng’s parents knew that he was set on a good path to get a great education and make a great career for himself. “[At] Stuy, most of the pressure came from myself [because of] a drive to succeed. This carried over in college. Everything came from within.”</p><p>Peng believes students are pushed through test prep. Prep helps kids who can test well but are not necessarily the best students. Once these kids get into Stuyvesant, many tend to stop working hard; they are there because their parents pushed them to get in. Peng observes that this doesn't mix well in Stuyvesant’s competitive environment. “This serves as an important message to the student body, especially the incoming freshmen. Be at Stuyvesant because you want to be; the journey doesn’t stop once you get in. The journey is about the hard work and the opportunities you take at Stuyvesant once you get in,” he said.</p><p>He also remarked on the tunnel vision students tend to have regarding colleges and their futures. “It really doesn’t matter what school you go to, what college. I know people who graduated from Ivys and are really regretting their jobs. They aren’t happy. I also have friends who went local and are now happy and prosperous,” Peng said. “It doesn’t matter where you go. At Stuy, you have more opportunities to get to where you want to go and people should make the most out of this.”</p><p>In terms of extracurriculars, Peng was very involved in Red Cross. Initially, he pursued it because it would look good on his college application. Over time, he found that he really enjoyed it. He paddled for the Red Cross dragon boat team and noted it as a highlight of his high school career.</p><p>Peng was also on the Ultimate Frisbee team during his senior year, but couldn't play for most of the season due to an injury. “I wasn’t someone who tried to take on as many extracurriculars as possible, but wanted to do the ones I was really interested in,” Peng reflected. “This is something I really hope students understand. It's not about how many extracurriculars they do, it's about the quality of the type of work that they want to do.”</p><p>“SING! was totally around when I was at Stuy,” Peng said with a smile. He fondly described the context of 2006 SING! during his senior year. “There was this curse, that after a certain even number of years, the seniors would always lose. The last three times the seniors lost was in intervals of eight years. During my year, we had to break this curse. It was very, very close, but we won.”</p><p>Looking back, Peng really appreciated the energy that SING! brought to Stuyvesant. “It really brought school spirit to a school which could be really demoralizing,” he said. Only taking a minor role in the tech department during senior year, Peng regrets not having been more involved in SING!. “I feel like I missed out, and I really try to encourage students to get involved in SING! because it’s a really big, amazing part of the Stuy experience,” he lamented.  He is content to notice the more performance-oriented plays today, which display the various stage talents and visual arts of the students, versus the more storyline-based shows during his time.</p><p>Peng also got his first taste of teaching through extracurriculars when he assisted his friends with calculus concepts at AIS tutoring during his junior year. He pursued math and was proud to complete the rigorous honors math sequence; Peng was in the BC Calculus course while his friends were in the AB course. While his peers were having difficulty with some of the concepts, Peng understood the material and could convey it well. This gave Peng the boost to look into tutoring and teaching. That summer he took part in the Summer Youth Education Program (SYEP), during which he was paid by the city to mentor little kids in a day camp. He also did teacher’s assistant (TA) work for his old SHSAT prep center. This paved the way for his interest in teaching.</p><p>Peng attended Carnegie Mellon for his undergraduate education, where he majored in finance. When he entered in 2007, the business industry was booming. “When I was at Carnegie Mellon, there was talk of graduating with a business degree, signing with a company, making a $20,000 bonus, and making $70,000 right off the start,” Peng reflected. “It was a hype that really never materialized.”</p><p>This was largely because of a major recession from the Global Financial crisis of 2008; Peng graduated in 2010. The crash led to an absence of jobs. The one thing Peng continued to do every summer was return to New York and do TA work. When he graduated from college, he had teaching to fall back on.</p><p>Before coming back to Stuyvesant, Peng taught at the Law and City school, as well as a non-profit school in Queens. Peng says it’s a weird feeling being back at Stuyvesant, especially addressing some of his former teachers by their first names instead of ‘Mr.’ or ‘Ms.’</p><p>With his return, Mr. Peng has observed some changes around the school. For one, he has been happy to see an increase in the number of guidance counselors in the school. “Back when I was in school, we only had around three. If you had issues or was overwhelmed with stress, there really wasn't anyone to talk to. The mindset was like, ‘What do you expect? This is Stuy. Suck it up,’” he said. “Now, there are so many options for students to reach out to when they need help.”</p><p>Peng has also noticed a shift in the types of courses offered at Stuy, in addition to a decrease in Stuy’s number of rigorous courses. “A lot of classes are being phased out because the teachers who taught them are no longer here,” Peng said. “[Social Studies teacher George] Kennedy retired last year, and his popular Wall Street class is no longer offered. [Chemistry teacher] Dr. [Zhen Chuan] Li retired, and they took away higher level chemistry courses he brought to the table. Dr. Li was here when I was a student and really set the bar high in the chemistry department.”</p><p>Peng’s experiences as a Stuyvesant student have had a huge impact on his approach to teaching. He aims to improve upon the teaching methods he observed during his time at Stuyvesant. To do this, he actively implements new strategies in his teaching style to prepare students and accommodate their needs.</p><p>Peng encourages group-centered teaching and collaborative problem-solving. These were emphasized in his graduate program as the best methods of getting students to have balanced interactions. They help students feel more comfortable with addressing their lack of understanding with their peers and teachers. Different students understand things at different times. Students can interact and help each other get a firm grasp on the material in class, while Peng had to go back after a more ‘lecture-based’ class to consult with his teacher when he had difficulty.</p><p>In the end, Peng wants to make sure that students are well prepared for the Geometry Regents. With the implementation of the Common Core, the regents now requires students to think critically, surpassing surface-level thinking. Peng says this change was immediately noticeable when average scores dropped significantly. “I feel that, especially at a school as reputable as Stuy, this shouldn't happen,” Peng said. “These types of hard, complicated thinking-based questions are needed throughout the year for preparation.”</p><p>As a result, Peng relies on rigorous testing to determine whether students truly understand concepts. As a student, Peng always found Stuy’s exams to be tough. “I’m really lucky to be teaching [a fifth of the] freshman class. I want to make them understand [that] it just gets harder,” Peng said. “I can really emphasize to students that they need to develop strong study and work habits, as these really carry over.”</p><p>Peng also ensures that his students have adequate resources. He gives outlines for exams and offers services such as office hours and after-school help. “Students have really taken advantage of this, and [I] have seen their averages go up. I'm really glad to see this because it must be working,” Peng said.</p><p>Peng really feels that his experiences at Stuyvesant have shaped him into the man he is today and have taught him many valuable life skills. “The last two years have been really hectic for me. I got married, had a kid, am teaching in a new school, staying very late, and taking masters classes. All of these [life events] would be very overwhelming,” Peng said. “Stuy taught me time management, it taught me [how] to prioritize, and that I really can’t skim out the quality of my work. I [learned the importance of] putting the effort into all the facets of what I do. At Stuy, I had to multitask and had to stay on top of everything. This carries over throughout college, and you will see the difference. Within the competitive nature of college, you have to be on top of things. Coming from Stuy, you get this advantage. These carry over to life as well. You really don’t see it as a student in high school. But, those experiences and habits carry over.”</p><p>Peng has high hopes for his son, Derek. Though Derek is only 15 months old, Peng is already sending him to classes. “My wife and I will support him in anything he is interested in and wants to pursue. We won't force him into a corner,” Peng said.</p>	Article	5	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
637	﻿The Heart of Compassionate Medicine Patients should have the right to choose experimental treatments, but its role with the government and politics should be reconsidered. <p>The British High Court ordered the immediate removal of eleven-month-old Charlie Gard from mechanical ventilation this past July. At the time of his death, he could not hear or open his eyes without assistance, could not breathe on his own, had heart and kidney failure, and suffered chronic seizures.</p><p>Charlie was diagnosed with Mitochondrial DNA Depletion Syndrome (MDDS) when he was two months old. MDDS is an extremely rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the RRM2B protein. A dysfunctional form of this protein inevitably leads to muscle weakness, organ failure, and death.</p><p>The United States National Library of Medicine has only 15 other recorded cases of MDDS caused by the RRM2B mutation, none of which have been successfully treated. Earlier last year, Dr. Michio Hirano, the head neurologist at the Division of Neuromuscular Disorders at Columbia University Medical Center, set out to change that.</p><p>Hirano reached out to the medical team at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London (GOSH), where Charlie was being treated, to discuss his experimental nucleoside treatment. He believed it held a “theoretical possibility” of improving Charlie’s condition. However, an MRI revealed severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy—brain damage so severe that Hirano’s treatment, which would deal mainly with muscle atrophy, would prove futile.</p><p>As a result, GOSH began discussing the termination of Charlie’s life support and placing him in palliative care because there was such a limited chance that Hirano’s treatment would improve his quality of life. His doctors believed they were acting in Charlie’s best interest. His parents, however, felt it was their right to provide the treatment for their son.</p><p>In the U.K., disagreements between hospitals and parents are taken to the courts, where the court is expected to objectively determine whether or not continuing (or receiving) a treatment is in the child’s best interest. Both the English High Court and the European Court of Human Rights backed GOSH’s stance, and Charlie was taken off mechanical ventilation a week before his first birthday.</p><p>While in the U.S., it is ultimately up to the parents of children to decide whether or not they want to seek special permission to test these premature treatments; in the U.K., this decision is left up to the hospitals and courts. In fact, immediately following the European Court of Human Right’s decision, Charlie’s life support was set to be taken away on a date and time set by the hospital, not by his parents.</p><p>The long battle between England’s legal system and the hospital against Charlie’s parents raises questions concerning the rights and responsibilities of parents in determining medical treatment for their terminally ill children and the extent to which the government should get involved in these choices.</p><p>The type of medical treatment Charlie would have received is also known as compassionate medicine, which is the administration of drugs or treatments not approved by the FDA. It is used as a last resort on patients who have essentially run out of options. But hospitals have reservations about resorting to compassionate medicine because of the extreme risks it runs.</p><p>This makes the balance of power between the parents and the hospital an especially difficult one to strike; while a system which gives power to the parents often pressures doctors to perform treatments that they feel are a misdirected use of resources, a system like the one that Charlie’s parents claim condemned their son to death takes away the freedom of a patient to choose his or her medical options. The law essentially makes ethical decisions based on medical conjecture.</p><p>In an attempt to use public support to sway his doctors, Charlie’s parents raised over $2,000,000 on their GoFundMe online fundraiser, received support from President Trump and Pope Francis, and obtained an invitation from the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center to evaluate Charlie and carry out the experimental treatment, either in New York or in London.</p><p>Despite this popular support, the British government was able to block Charlie from receiving treatment in New York. Though Charlie’s condition at the time made it more than likely that nucleosome transfer wouldn’t make a difference in his life, his parents should have had the right to accept treatments even with a limited chance of success, given a few provisions. One is that parents should understand and accept the fact that compassionate medicine is nearly synonymous with risk. Doctors must take on the task of informing them about all exhaustible options so that the parents can make rational decisions.</p><p>Following that, the government should be kept as a third party with limited involvement in order to allow it to focus on streamlining the official drug approval process while also bypassing the socialized medicine argument. Compassionate medicine should not find itself dependent on public funds.</p><p>Unfortunately, all of the support Charlie received online also reveals how compassionate medicine’s projected legacy has been pushed and pulled to fit political agendas. Republicans such as House Speaker Paul Ryan are attempting to use Charlie’s stories in order to dismantle the Obama administration’s healthcare system. Ryan recently tweeted, “Health care should be between patients and doctors. Government has no place in the life or death business.” Vice President Mike Pence attributed his death to “all the talk on the left.” Yet note that ultimately, it wasn’t the British government that condemned Charlie to die, but the combined efforts and professional advice of the doctors and the hospitals that treated him.</p><p>Using him as a poster boy against government involvement in healthcare purposefully discounts the nuances of his story. The crux of Charlie’s story and the heart of medicine as a whole does not have to do with the morals of public healthcare. It has to do with parents and the law being able to reach a common ground and the definition of a child’s best interest.</p>	Article	6	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
638	﻿Still No Cellphones? In an elite school that boasts some of the best computer science and technology classes in the nation, the administration's approach toward electronics remains surprisingly obsolete. <p>The late bell rings in unison with a buzzing in your pocket as you tread past the second-floor scanners. You glance discreetly at your cellphone, only to find the pressing alert is a mere Facebook notification. The relief, however, is short-lived as a teacher materializes in the periphery of your vision. After an awkward exchange and a disapproving frown, your electronic is on its way to the dean’s office.</p><p>Getting cheated by the cellphone policy is an unofficial rite of passage for every Stuyvesant student. In an elite school that boasts some of the best computer science and technology classes in the nation, the administration's approach toward electronics remains surprisingly obsolete.</p><p>The newest NYCDOE cellphone policy, which came into effect in March 2015, permitted the usage of “cellphones and other electronic devices [in] the building.” But, backlash from a prior cheating scandal forced Stuyvesant to prolong its draconian cellphone policy. The hotly debated policy, endorsed by a majority of the Stuyvesant administration as well as Mayor Bloomberg, was an attempt to crack down on cheating at a time when it was prevalent at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Years later, current students are subject to the same ineffectual policy. A recent study by the Pew Research Center finds that even in schools that ban electronics entirely, up to 58 percent of students continue to use phones, an insubstantial decrease from 71 percent in schools with no such restrictions. Between the clean slates and multiple offenders, no one truly stops using their cellphones in school; they just get better at hiding it.</p><p>Instead of continuing to enforce this policy, it’s time for the administration to start vouching for a more positive alternative. Other specialized high schools, such as Brooklyn Tech and Staten Island Tech, have begun integrating cell phones into their curricula. Students are encouraged to download software that allows easy access to art programs, spreadsheets, and dictionaries, as well as to use cellphones as a medium for research and internet access when no other electronics are available. Teaching students how to use cellphones productively encourages participation and even saves money. The National Education Association dubbed cellphones “cost effective for schools.”</p><p>Similarly, about 73 percent of teachers agree that cellphones serve as helpful learning aids. Use of these technologies in classrooms can motivate disengaged students, improving their relationship with the administration. Instead of a hostile environment in which students feel a lack of trust from teachers forced to follow the regulations set by the cellphone policy, a more relaxed atmosphere is fostered.</p><p>The strict regulations of the cellphone policy are enforced through a two-strike system. A first offense requires the student to wait until after 10th period to retrieve their phone. For students who are involved in extracurricular activities or have lengthy commutes, this can produce an inconvenient deviation to an already packed schedule.</p><p>A second offense demands that the student’s legal guardian retrieve the device. This works to unfairly punish the wrong person, causing interruptions in a busy work-life and unnecessary trips for legal guardians who reside far from the school.</p><p>When a guardian is unavailable, the student is forced to commute without a phone. Anything (being lost, extended train delays, a mugging) that transpires in the period of time their cellphone remains at school may have been easily defused by its presence. According to NBC News, up to 85 percent of students felt safer with a cellphone on their person. It’s a liability to essentially “disarm” students, as well as to deprive them of their peace of mind.</p><p>A better replacement for the current cellphone policy is a three-strike system, in which the harsher punishment of a guardian retrieving the device would only be necessary after three confiscations. Similarly, requiring a parent to be aware their child got their phone confiscated and having their consent to return it rather than their physical presence would be a step in the right direction.</p><p>Stuyvesant upholds an impressive reputation, but the cellphone policy hinders the sort of progress that sets apart our school from the rest. Antiquated policies that exist for the sake of trying to mend a once-tarnished reputation need to be revoked, the sooner the better.</p>	Article	7	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
639	﻿Greater Than Grenfell The Grenfell Fire, more than being a senseless tragedy, reveals disturbing socioeconomic imbalances and is a failure on the government’s part. <p>“The majority of the building’s residents were low-income—according to Vox, many of them were immigrants and refugees from Syria, Sudan, and Eritrea.”</p><p>Three years ago, brothers Mohammed Alhajali and Omar Alhajali fled Syria. Though the journey was dangerous, they escaped to the U.K., became university students, and successfully began new lives. But everything changed on the night of June 14, when a refrigerator caught fire inside Behailu Kebede’s fourth-floor apartment at the Grenfell Tower.</p><p>The fire spread more rapidly than anyone had anticipated, leaping up the building’s exterior and engulfing it in a matter of minutes. The Alhajalis tried to escape from the 14th floor together, but were separated in the tower’s single stairwell. While Omar eventually found his way out, Mohammed did not.</p><p>Mohammed Alhajali became the first of at least 80 people pronounced dead in the Grenfell Tower fire. Though the fire took place months ago, the official death toll is expected to be announced in 2018, and will likely have three figures.</p><p>The tragedy of this fire, however, doesn’t solely lie in the death count, or in how long the building burned (about 60 hours), but in the way that this fire was completely preventable. Simply put, Grenfell Tower was a death trap where simple changes could have saved numerous lives.</p><p>The building lacked fire escapes, alarms, and sprinklers. According to survivor accounts, its single staircase turned out to be catastrophically crowded during the fire. In addition, the building’s recently-installed insulation and cladding contained flammable materials—elements that played a key role in spreading the fire to the building’s other floors.</p><p>Some of the reasons why such obvious safety hazards were overlooked seem to revolve around who the residents of Grenfell Tower—and their neighbors—were. Grenfell Tower is located in Kensington, an extremely wealthy neighborhood with one of Britain’s largest wealth gaps. In fact, the majority of the building’s residents were low-income—according to Vox, many of them were immigrants and refugees from Syria (like the Alhajalis), Sudan, and Eritrea. Grenfell Tower is considered social housing, meaning that the rent is legally supposed to be kept at an affordable price for low-income residents.</p><p>Over time, however, some of the units in Grenfell Tower were rented at more expensive rates as a money-hungry management willingly turned a blind eye in the hopes of profiting. For the same reason, the surrounding area became increasingly gentrified as local councils—namely, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization—attempted to attract wealthier folk and cover up Kensington’s poorer areas.</p><p>Grenfell Tower underwent various renovations as part of the management’s efforts to disguise the area’s poverty and appeal to rich prospective tenants. One of these renovations was a seemingly innocuous yet highly flammable version of exterior cladding (a material that covered Grenfell Tower in a shell in order to beautify it), and the rest is history.</p><p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of the entire incident is the way the local management willingly overlooked the basic safety needs of the poorer residents in the area in an effort to attract wealthier ones, even though Grenfell Tower’s tenants repeatedly filed complaints and attempted to draw the issue to the management’s attention.</p><p>Accompanying this neglect is the implication that the lives of minorities and the poor hold less value relative to the lives of the privileged. To hold social housing to a lower standard counters the mission of social housing entirely, which is to provide a safe and secure home for the disadvantaged and those in dire financial circumstances.</p><p>There are steps that must be taken to prevent a needless disaster of this nature from occurring again. The most immediately obvious one is that Britain should ban flammable cladding on tall buildings, like the United States and several other countries have already. Cladding wasn’t already banned chiefly because business-friendly politicians in Britain have long campaigned to free businesses from the weight of safety regulations.</p><p>The British government must now prioritize the basic safety needs of its citizens over big business, beginning by inspecting other buildings for the kind of cladding that spurred this fire’s growth and removing it when found.</p><p>More importantly, in addition to providing stronger government oversight of businesses and housing management, the British government should fully dedicate itself to ensuring that all former residents of Grenfell Tower are able to come forward for treatment and help without repercussions. Though Prime Minister Theresa May initially promised that anyone affected by the tragedy would receive government support (i.e. accommodation and healthcare) with no regard to their immigration status, she later went back on her word and stated that anyone coming forward for help would be subject to normal immigration rules.</p><p>Doing background checks puts undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation and will likely discourage them from coming forward to receive the attention they need. This is not the time to be performing immigration checks; the least May can do is guarantee that everyone, regardless of immigration status, receives the necessary care.</p><p>It is beyond tragic that a catastrophe of this nature is needed to reveal the disastrous consequences that gentrification can have. The Grenfell Action Group warned that only a catastrophic fire would convince the management to finally take fire safety regulations seriously last November, yet no one listened until the building was engulfed in flames.</p><p>Grenfell’s tragedy holds a striking similarity to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. Both are chilling evidence of corporations that prioritize profit over citizens, workers, and residents, and of a government that blatantly neglects those at the bottom of society. Investigations into the causes of the Grenfell Fire, as well as whether the local management can be charged with corporate manslaughter, are still underway. We can only hope that they will bring about rightful and long-awaited change.</p>	Article	8	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
640	A Discussion on Discussion The freedom of open discussion is not as important as being mindful of sensitive issues related to our history of oppression. <p>“...this prejudice hasn’t been erased, but rather has evolved.”</p><p>Areas like New York City and Silicon Valley have long been acknowledged as places that lean politically left, a culture that remains pervasive both at school and in the workplace. But recently, James Damore, a former engineer at Google, released an internal memo in an act of rebellion that challenged these ideas of liberalism and equality.</p><p>Following the implementation of a diversity program at Google intended to help the company fight bias in the workplace, Damore voices his thoughts in a memo titled “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber.” In it, he outlines inherent differences between men and women, suggesting that women have a propensity for lower stress jobs because of their genetic predisposition for “neuroticism,” which "may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs." And, since they generally have an interest in “people rather than things,” he suggests that they may be better suited for jobs in “social or artistic areas,” especially since he claims women have a higher level of “agreeableness” that makes them unsuited for leadership positions.</p><p>Many of his coworkers were quick to condemn him for sexism and promoting harmful gender stereotypes, including the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai. Others, however, sent him personal messages applauding his bravery for opening up discussion. They claimed they were afraid to openly show support because of political discrimination. In our current political climate, many Americans, including our own president, have spoken out about feeling suffocated by political correctness, which they argue shames dissenters into silence.</p><p>But this so-called “political suffocation” should by no means be used as justification to promote ideas that are blatantly sexist and foster harmful stereotypes.</p><p>Damore did succeed in bringing attention to his ideas. Yet he was not successful in proving his own claims because he shared erroneous information that threatened to reverse strides made in closing the gender gap. For instance, despite Damore’s simplistic view of the neuroticism of women, personality traits are qualitative, meaning any data gathered from research conducted by psychologists can be interpreted in hundreds of ways. Even David Schmitt, the director of the study cited by Damore in his memo, has voiced disagreement with Damore’s analysis, saying, “It is unclear to me that this sex difference would play a role in success within the Google workplace.”</p><p>This is not an isolated event, but part of a long trend in which men reinforce age-old gender stereotypes that allow this bias to persevere. For instance, in 2005, Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard, gave a statement crediting the shortage of successful women in science to a lack of an “innate ability” to perform as well as men in certain academic disciplines. Similarly, in 2015, Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital gave a statement in an interview saying he would consider hiring more women in the future, but he didn’t want to “lower the standards” of the company.</p><p>As a country, we’ve spent decades trying to reverse a history of oppression. Yet it’s clear that this prejudice hasn’t been erased, merely evolved. Many people have gone from believing that women are incapable of joining the workforce to thinking that they’re incapable of holding senior positions because their supposedly more caring nature makes them better suited for jobs like teaching. Sexism still lingers, and the many incidents involving insensitive comments made by men expressing their outdated opinions serve to reinforce these ideas.</p><p>Many people take advantage of online forums to express controversial opinions, even illegitimate ones with no scientific backing. Similarly, Google allows its employees to engage in discussion through internal messages. However, Damore argues that “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence.”</p><p>The problem at hand actually goes beyond Google’s political agenda. This isn’t an issue of silencing conservatives or shunning the ideas of someone who simply wants to stimulate discussion—it’s an issue of a Google employee who decided to immaturely attack women and their role in the tech industry. Though Google decided to fire Damore for “advancing harmful gender stereotypes” and rightly chose to prioritize their female employees, the impact of his memo will be felt for years to come.</p><p>Damore’s baseless conclusions, which have been drawn by multiple men in the past, will only serve to increase hostility in the workplace and increase the wage gap. His ideas are discouraging to women trying to pursue a career in the STEM field, and they have no scientific backing.</p><p>Ultimately, open discussion is essential for honest and intelligent discourse. But honesty and intelligence stem from being informed and having tact, something that is much harder to come by.</p>	Article	9	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
641	Trumping Science: Trump’s War against Reality Scientific facts are the most objective and reliable metric for the validity of an idea or theory. As an institution that is held to the highest standards of honesty and reliability, it is the government's duty to inform its policy on science. <p>During his campaign season, President Donald Trump claimed that climate change was a Chinese hoax. He demanded “no more massive injections” in an unfounded critique of vaccines. He went as far as to describe reports denying a link between vaccines and autism as “fudged up.” Unsurprisingly, Trump and his administration have changed the role the federal government plays in science, and in the process have altered one of the most important partnerships in the modern world.</p><p>One of the evident ways the Trump administration has damaged this relationship is through the implementation of policies that contradict the scientific consensus. For instance, this past June, Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which was widely condemned by the scientific community. This pivotal decision will slow the U.S.'s transition toward renewable energy, have diplomatic repercussions that come with abandoning an international agreement, and result in economic costs in the long term.</p><p>Indicative of Trump’s indifference toward the opinions of the scientific community, this decision disregarded the overwhelming amount of evidence that humans are a primary cause of climate change and failed to consider the arguments of 800 earth science and energy experts across 46 states who penned an open letter to the president asking that he change his climate policy.</p><p>A less publicized but still important example of the Trump administration's disregard of science is Environment Protection Agency (EPA) director Scott Pruitt’s refusal to ban the pesticide chlorpyrifos. In doing so, he rejected the EPA’s conclusion that it leaves unsafe levels of residue on crops and has severe neurological effects on developing children.</p><p>Refusing to accept scientific fact appears to be a trend in the Trump administration. The president is also known to support the existence of a link between vaccines and autism, saying as recently as three years ago, “I am being proven right about massive vaccinations—the doctors lied.” Such comments misinform and unnecessarily alarm the public, the opposite of what the government-science relationship is intended to do.</p><p>Not only has Trump created an environment in which baseless claims wield more power than ones accepted by the scientific community, he has also distanced people from their impact on the environment. According to a series of e-mails with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Trump administration told the USDA to “stop using terms” like “climate change,” “greenhouse gases,” and other phrases that imply human cause, and to instead use terms such as “weather extremes” to communicate with farmers. Such terms take away all sense of human responsibility for today’s environmental issues and promote non-intervention, countering  acts to increase awareness of such issues.</p><p>Moreover, the Trump administration has been suppressing scientific progress by withholding information regarding meetings behind scientific decisions and minimizing press interaction instead of emphasizing transparency. In fact, the EPA has been sued in order for it to comply with the law and publicly release records of meetings regarding the Clean Water Act, which would impact acres of wetlands in the U.S. and the many endangered species that live on them. It has also removed mentions of Obama’s Climate Action Plan and promises of UN climate reform on federal websites.</p><p>In addition to the EPA, the Departments of Energy, Interior, and State have also been sued for censorship in their records. Even more directly, Trump has cut federal funding from major organizations such as NASA and the National Institute of Health. For instance, NASA’s Earth Science budget will drop by 11 percent, losing more than $217 million in funding. Similarly, the EPA will have its lowest budget of the past 40 years, losing 30 percent of all funding. Other programs dedicated to research and disease prevention, such as the National Cancer Institute and the Institute of Health, will lose up to $6 billion in funds.</p><p>While those with political power should be making evidence-based claims and supporting scientific progress, Trump’s blatant attempts to stir up hysteria over baseless facts reflect an inappropriate relationship he and his administration currently hold with the country. Ideally, there should be a balance of power between government and science, with continuous support and growth in each of them.</p><p>This ideal relationship existed during Obama’s presidency. In Obama’s eight years of presidency, he and his administration proposed new programs for energy and climate change, selected renowned scientists to lead his programs, enforced regulations to preserve the environment, worked with a Republican-dominated Congress to fund new research, and promoted the importance of science in both the present and for future generations.</p><p>In contrast, Trump’s administration emphasizes the strained state of the relationship between government and science. As government and science both strive to better the lives of the people, it is imperative that they cooperate rather than compete. Scientific facts are an objective and reliable metric for the validity of an idea or theory. As an institution that is held to the highest standards of honesty and reliability, it is the government's duty to support its scientists, not undermine them.</p><p>The government should support scientists working on projects too large for the private sector, such as combating climate change or developing space travel. At the same time, it should make sure science remains ethical through regulations prohibiting practices such as human cloning. Through such cooperation, the government can create an environment that promotes scientific development and creates a more informed public and a brighter future for humanity.</p>	Article	10	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
642	﻿Reframing Affirmative Action at Stuyvesant “Any concerns I have are somehow invalidated because I am both Black and Latino,” senior Eugene Thomas said. “Every single time I’ve ever discussed college, I’ve been told, ‘You're gonna get in wherever you want. Let's face it: you're black!’ like it's some proverbial golden ticket into the top universities.” <p>“Any concerns I have are somehow invalidated because I am both Black and Latino,” senior Eugene Thomas said. “Every single time I’ve ever discussed college, I’ve been told, ‘You're gonna get in wherever you want. Let's face it: you're black!’ like it's some proverbial golden ticket into the top universities.”</p><p>Affirmative Action is a divisive practice that is often perceived to benefit Black and Latino students at the expense of White and Asian students during the college admissions process. As demonstrated by Thomas’s comment, many people, Stuyvesant students included, erroneously see Affirmative Action as a race-based quota that acts as a gateway for Black and Latino students simply by virtue of skin color and regardless of qualification.</p><p>But this isn’t a “Black versus Asian” dilemma — it’s not a zero-sum game, and a successful black student is not a rival but a deserving peer. Affirmative Action is meant to counter historical forms of discrimination, and regardless of whether the Supreme Court strikes down Affirmative Action, universities like Harvard will continue to strive to represent the best version of America, and that means diversity.</p><p>The History of Affirmative Action</p><p>In reality, Affirmative Action has a much less specific definition than race-based quotas in admissions. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, requiring government contractors and employers to take "affirmative action" to ensure that applicants and employees were not discriminated against based upon their “race, creed, color, or national origin." President Lyndon B. Johnson then added gender as a clause. The order was implemented to curb prejudice and discrimination against any individual American.</p><p>Affirmative Action historically helped Asian immigrants who were poor and non-English speakers. From 1981 to 1996, the percentage of bachelor’s degrees earned by Asian Americans grew from 2 to 5.5 percent, which is significantly faster than their population growth, per the US Census Bureau.</p><p>Opponents of affirmative action have always held that the policy discriminates against white Americans. Edward Blum, an anti-affirmative action activist, sued the University of Texas at Austin for disfavoring white applicants in 2009. Last year, in a 4-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the university and emphasized the importance of diversity in education.</p><p>The decision was controversial, and Justice Alito wrote in a dissenting opinion that it would hurt Asian Americans. Blum has used Alito’s dissent to co-opt Asian Americans into his white nationalist agenda, and is suing Harvard University for discriminating against Asian American applicants. Stuyvesant and three other high schools with large Asian American populations have been subpoenaed for the lawsuit.</p><p>Many point to the achievements of minority groups such as Asian- and Jewish- Americans as proof that the United States is a functioning meritocracy.</p><p>However, large numbers of Asians only began to immigrate into the United States following the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which allowed Asians into the country under the condition that they were well educated. White supremacists then falsely claimed high levels of Asian American education were a product of the United States, rather than the various immigrants’ countries of origin. Thus, Asian Americans were labeled as the “model minority,” and the Civil Rights Movement was attacked as a tool that benefitted other “problem” minorities.</p><p>Despite the legal end to segregation in 1964, redlining (policies that prevent minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods) and white flight (when more affluent families abandon certain neighborhoods) are among several factors that continue to force African Americans and Latinos to settle in much poorer neighborhoods. In turn, they have a poor public education system and stand to gain from policies like Affirmative Action.</p><p>“Colorblind Policies Make a Colorblind World”</p><p>Many Stuyvesant students would describe the SHSAT as the “ultimate equalizer,” giving everyone an equal chance to have a quality education and thus find economic success. Through colorblind testing, the SHSAT is supposedly a step toward a colorblind society.</p><p>Thousands of Asian Americans accepted into elite high schools based on a colorblind exam want to believe that colorblind policies work and that these should be adopted by the college admissions process. The notion that so-called  colorblind admissions policies are actually products of systemic oppression might appear to invalidate the accomplishments of Stuyvesant students and be detrimental to the school’s large Asian American population.</p><p>Colorblind education policies are, however, a myopic approach to inequality that continue to play host to systemic racism, such as redlining and white flight, which has resulted in massive failures and what the DOE describes as “modern-day segregation.”</p><p>The logic of race neutrality leaves segments of the Stuyvesant community complicit in a white nationalist agenda: “If Asian Americans found success without race-based assistance, Black and Latinos should be able to do so without Affirmative Action.”</p><p>But Affirmative Action is ultimately about creating a diverse student body. Many Asian cultures place a heavy emphasis on examinations and view them as objective measurements of achievement. Even if exams could be truly objective, Harvard doesn’t really care, and doesn’t want a student body comprised of competent test takers; there are simply too many other traits, including talent, individuality, and even background, that can’t be quantified by standardized testing.</p><p>It is also important to note that homogenizing Asian Americans into a single group is a ploy by Edward Blum and a white nationalist agenda. While Chinese, Korean, and Indian Americans have educational success, many Southeast Asian immigrants, including Hmong, Cambodian, and Laotian Americans, drop out of high school at rates approaching 40 percent, per The New York Times. Don’t get caught up in the rhetoric of an “Asian America,” because Affirmative Action also provides aid for many Asian immigrants.</p><p>White nationalists don’t want a meritocracy when it doesn’t benefit them — though they support colorblind admissions at Harvard, they are heavily opposed to them in California, where Affirmative Action is banned. According to the New York Times, they have called the Asian American student population “the hordes of Asians.” Edward Blum is not looking out for Asian Americans—he has systematically brought several pieces of key civil rights legislation, such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, before the Supreme Court to have them struck down, which has disenfranchised many Asian immigrants.</p><p>Affirmative Action for Women</p><p>Often, the fight for women’s suffrage came at the cost of equal rights legislation for African Americans. In fact, women’s suffrage advocates Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony refused to support the 15th Amendment, aligning instead with racist Southerners who argued that women’s votes could be used to offset those of African Americans.</p><p>And what’s horrific is that this isn’t just an isolated incident. Time and time again, women are willing to tear down racial minorities in order to further their own success.</p><p>Today, may women argue against race-based affirmative action policies. “Many times, students fixate on race instead of the fact that many females benefit from affirmative action in STEM fields,” senior Sammie Paul said. Helping women in STEM is undoubtedly important, but is not mutually exclusive with helping minorities.</p><p>In general, many polls have shown that a much larger portion of Americans support gender-based affirmative action than those who support race-based affirmative action, proving that most Americans do not understand that both types of affirmative action come from the same executive order.</p><p>In Conclusion</p><p>The backlash against Affirmative Action reveals a clear misunderstanding of the purpose of the practice. Colleges are tasked with creating a student body that is capable of thriving and accepting students who have something to add to the university and the experiences of other students.</p><p>Affirmative Action not only seeks to give all students a fair chance at top universities, but it takes into account the different obstacles students of various races and backgrounds must overcome.</p><p>Senior Anna Pacheco, who was the only Latina in her predominantly Asian prep school, recounts her prep teacher always telling her that she didn’t have to try as hard in tests since she was Puerto Rican.</p><p>Let this be clear: students don’t get in "just because they're black/Hispanic/women." While it is true that colleges want a diverse student body, that diversity does not only mean race. The diversity they are looking for includes other factors such as location, intended majors, and types of extracurriculars. And increased diversity can have positive effects, both socially and academically, such as exposing students to different ideals and ways of thinking, as well as helping to improve both short and long term race relations.</p>	Article	11	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
643	﻿A Wonder of a Feminist “Wonder Woman” is a spectacular superhero film focusing on Diana Prince’s character and feminist mindset. <p>It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…a woman?</p><p>Indeed, “Wonder Woman” retells the origin story of Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), the princess of the Amazons, who is one of the secluded female warriors created by the Greek god Zeus. But when American pilot and spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is rescued by Diana and reveals the chaos of World War I to the Amazons, Diana decides to go with him to put an end to the global conflict by detecting and killing the god of war, Ares, who she believes to be responsible for the war.</p><p>Though the premise of the movie seems to be a typical “hero beats villain in epic fighting scene and saves the day” plotline (especially similar to superhero-war film and origin story “Captain America: The First Avenger”), “Wonder Woman” distinguishes itself by focusing on exploring Diana’s character instead of constant, action-packed fighting.</p><p>From the very start of the movie, Diana is depicted as thirsty for action, wanting to train like other Amazons and defend the world. However, upon entering grim, devastated Europe, she sees the horrific casualties of World War I with her own eyes. And with villains such as General Ludendorff (Danny Huston), a bloodthirsty patriot determined to defend his country, and Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), a brilliant yet sadistic chemist attempting to create new, devastating chemical weapons in order to win the war, Diana’s ideal views of mankind begin to falter. As she witnesses the brutality that humans are willing to subject each other to in their desire to succeed, she questions whether humanity is worth protecting.</p><p>Of course, that isn’t to say that “Wonder Woman” is completely barren of action. One scene, for instance, depicts Diana refusing to listen to Steve’s cynical mindset and crossing No Man’s Land alone, while deflecting enemy bullets and bombs. As she charges forward unyieldingly, the Allied soldiers begin to follow her lead and step out of their trench, fighting the German troops. It’s breathtaking to watch the vibrant Diana, surrounded by a landscape of grays and blues, stand up to an army of men and lead her allies to victory.</p><p>It is moments such as the iconic No Man’s Land scene that contribute to Wonder Woman’s title as a feminist icon. Throughout the film, Diana is told what she can or cannot do as a woman by countless men. However, she ignores the standard societal expectations of women that she has no place in fighting and that she should simply wear pretty dresses for men to gaze at. She continues to wear her own armor, barge into private military meetings, and triumph over soldiers because that is what will help others. Even though men may call her naive or tell her she cares too much about others, Diana’s determination and empathy make her Wonder Woman and lead her to defy them.</p><p>In fact, despite Diana and Steve’s constant bickering, their somewhat reluctant alliance eventually grows into a charming romance; Diana still remains firm in her ideals and decisions, even if Steve disapproves. One instance portraying this consists of Steve trying to stop Diana from killing Ludendorff, who worries about her hastiness, to which she responds, “What I do is not up to you.” This line truly embodies Wonder Woman’s feminism, as it shows how Diana does not need a man in order for her to be a hero—she just needs to stay true to herself.</p><p>But Diana isn’t the only one empowering other women—Patty Jenkins, the director of “Wonder Woman” and the first female director of an American studio superhero movie, has achieved many records, including “Wonder Woman” becoming the highest grossing film directed by a woman (grossing over $797 million worldwide) and the DC Extended Universe’s most critically successful film (competing against other films such as “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Suicide Squad”). Meanwhile, in 2016, women comprised just seven percent of all directors of the top 250 domestic grossing films. Perhaps Jenkins’s accomplishments with “Wonder Woman” will be the start of more women obtaining opportunities in the filmmaking industry.</p><p>With the success of “Wonder Woman” and an upcoming sequel, hopefully, Diana Prince will inspire other women to be proud of their gender for a lifetime.</p>	Article	12	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
644	The Legacy that “Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812” Left Behind Cozily nestled in the bustling streets of Times Square, the Imperial Theater was a world unto itself as an eager audience was introduced to rapturous,... <p>Cozily nestled in the bustling streets of Times Square, the Imperial Theater was a world unto itself as an eager audience was introduced to rapturous, 19th century Russia. Written by Leo Tolstoy, “War and Peace” (1869) took on a new life in the Broadway musical, “Natasha, Pierre, and The Great Comet of 1812.” The two hour and 30 minute long production illustrated the decadent affair between the young and wide-eyed Natasha Rostova (played by Denee Benton) and the handsome, though already married, Anatole (played by Lucas Steele) as she waited for her beloved fiance, Prince Andrey (played by Nicholas Belton), to return home from war.</p><p>Interestingly quirky and brilliant, “The Great Comet” was declared Broadway’s “next ‘Hamilton’”—both similar in their aim of depicting dense, historical novels as well as their ever-rising rate of success. 12 Tony nominations, the most of any production in 2017, were a confirmation of this success. Yet, the production came to a screeching halt with its final performance on September 3rd, with controversial casting marking the end of an incredibly successful four year run.The end ultimately began in late July, when a financial scare prompted the show’s creator, Dave Malloy, to replace the actor of Pierre, Okieriete “Oak” Onaodowan, an African American best known for playing a supporting role in Hamilton, with Mandy Patinkin, a well-known, white actor who had starred in the famous 1987 “The Princess Bride.”</p><p>Only a few weeks prior was Onaodowan chosen to replace the original actor, Josh Groban. Yet a month into the show’s run with Onaodowan, ticket sales dropped to $900,000 a week, which contrasted to the $1.2 million a week that Groban had brought when he played Pierre. In a panicked effort to boost publicity and ticket sales, Malloy called in Patinkin to step in the role, in the hopes that the revered name would help sell the show.</p><p>The announcement unleashed a wave of angry protests on social media, as many defended Onaodowan and bluntly pointed out the racism that was involved in the casting replacement. Soon afterwards, Patinkin declined the offer, possibly afraid that in accepting it, he would elicit an even more vehement response on social media. Subsequently, Onaodowan announced on Instagram that his last performance would be on August 13th and that he would not be returning due to the second-rate treatment he received as a black actor. With the debacle leaving neither Patinkin nor Onaodowan to play Pierre, Malloy was left to take on the responsibility to play Pierre for the last three weeks of its run.</p><p>Though racial discrimination is, unfortunately, not an uncommon occurrence in the entertainment industry, the producers’ decisions in this case proved to be an incongruous one; the show had received high praise for its diversity, especially with African American actress Denee Benton playing the lead role in a script that doesn’t necessarily warrant people of color to play the characters. Having had made great strides in giving minorities a larger platform, the decision to replace Onaodowan ultimately led the show to retrogress to a state where white people are evidently valued more.</p><p>But despite this debacle being an ingrained part of the show’s brief history, it should be made clear that the controversy should not define “The Great Comet”’s legacy. Even if it was not one that could be easily forgiven, nor forgotten, by many, the casting choice was a mistake. If one could disregard the controversy, even momentarily, it would be agreed upon that “The Great Comet” was an unforgettable Broadway masterpiece, having had done unprecedented things that delightfully deviated from the traditions in Broadway theater.</p><p>For one, its score is unlike any other, as it is difficult to pinpoint one specific genre. Critics have instead characterized the score as an “electro-pop opera,” and as it suggests, it was a mesh of electronic-dance music, folk music, opera and pop. This combination of old and modern genres livened the story with an interesting twist.</p><p>The stage poses as another one of the show’s groundbreaking elements. Instead of making the actors and audience two discrete entities with a traditional stage, the set is designed so that there are bits and pieces of stage around the room, intertwining the actors, audience, and band together. The ensemble covered every part of the theater, and they had no qualms with interacting with the audience, inviting them to be part of the story and making them the butt of a multitude of jokes.</p><p>Another facet that must not be overlooked was its grandiose lighting. Elaborate golden chandeliers and light bulbs, hung against the backdrop of sweeping red velvet curtains, embodied the formidable explosion of comets. The light playfully followed along to every song while casting a romantic aura over the room. Even the table stand lamps present in every row of seats played a part of the elaborate light repertoire.</p><p>From its breathtaking lighting, to the meticulously crafted costumes, to the myriad of exuberant dancing scenes that would erupt the theater into a delightful chaos, it is no doubt that “The Great Comet” excels in many categories. Yet, arguably the most memorable facet that Broadway will take away was the profound portrayal of its story. “The Great Comet” was able to take a trite plot line that has been used in a plethora of other stories over centuries of literature and allow the audience to see more than the superficiality of a treacherous affair between a beautiful princess and an alluring man.</p><p>Instead, we learn to recognize the grueling dilemma that young Natasha is burdened with and how one decision has the devastating capacity to ultimately to ruin her and her family. We see the great extent of the genuine compassion and worry that one can have for another human being in Natasha’s cousin and closest friend, Sonya (played by Ingrid Michaelson), as she emotionally dedicates herself to protecting Natasha from disgracing her name. We meet Pierre, an old, wealthy aristocrat who is unhappily married and cannot find a substantial reason to exist but still is able to muster compassion in his heart for a heartbroken friend.</p><p>“The Great Comet” culminates in a climactic ending: the falling of the comet itself. The show doesn’t make a contrived effort to present an emerging hero from a fog nor a glossy ending to a tumultuous affair. There is only complication and uncertainty. Pierre sings one last song—a haunting and poignant aria narrating the fall of the comet. But instead of panic or despair of the destruction that will soon befall them, he joyfully accepts the fate ahead. While listening to the aria, one may even draw a semblance between the show and the comet in one of its lyrics: both were unforgettable forces that travelled “with inexpressible speed through immeasurable space,” only for them to “suddenly have stopped… like an arrow piercing the earth.”</p><p>No doubt in mind, “The Great Comet” was nothing short of rapturous, exquisite, funny, and imbued with an enthralling decadence at its core. But the sincere and heartfelt moments were what allowed the show to rise up above most others to become a truly indelible mark in Broadway history. This is not to assert that this racial issue is far less important than its brilliant facets or that it can be forgotten or glossed over. But there is no denying that it is indeed a pity that this was to happen―a pity that the show ended and a pity that we are once again reminded that as a society, we are still far from reaching racial equality in the entertainment industry. But even despite the issue, one can only wish for “The Great Comet” to return to Broadway soon and to have learned from its mistakes. And hopefully, the rest of Broadway can learn too, the good, as well as the bad.</p>	Article	13	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

647	﻿Photoville  <p>Since 2011, United Photo Industries has been showcasing photography from professionals and amateurs alike in a uniquely organized set of galleries called Photoville. It’s free, out in the open, and presents pieces that range from disturbing to inspiring. There are also various book signings, photography workshops, and nighttime movie screenings. For two weeks in August, Photoville premieres its pieces along the waterfront of Brooklyn Bridge Park, where out-of-commission shipping containers are reused to showcase photography and the occasional painting. The containers are all darkly lit and each contains an exhibit that highlights Photoville’s main theme: to “discover” what the media doesn’t say and delve into the implications of the media’s silence.</p><p>Besides the shipping containers, what stands out most is the content of the artwork. Each piece addresses problems that, though far from the safe confines of Photoville, are very real. In the photo gallery “Dual Shadows,” visual journalist Jake Naughton follows members of East Africa’s LGBTQ community as they try to escape persecution in their home countries. One subject, Javan, is a 19-year-old transgender woman from Uganda who fled to Kenya to escape abuse, but decided to return to Uganda to set an example. A portrait of Javan reveals a woman clearly exhausted by the oppression brought on her by her country who, despite her suffering, remains defiantly elegant and strong. What makes Javan’s story so dynamic is the contribution of Naughton’s photographs; they include screenshots of death threats via text message, gatherings of other refugees fleeing their countries, and more moments that contribute to the harrowing journeys of people who seem to be a world away but are brought closer through the photographs.</p><p>In “China Through Chinese Eyes,” photographers capture the fighting spirit of China’s people in the face of their country’s social, cultural, and economic struggles. A photo by Guo Xianzhong shows a mother trying to calm her son as he suffers from having accidentally taken one of many illegal vaccines released in China over the years. Another photo shows a young man crying of homesickness because he was barred from travelling back to his home province.</p><p>There are many exhibits with work that documents the refugee crisis, but “Finding Home,” which follows the lives of three Syrian refugee mothers and their newborn babies, is a standout. Photos taken just minutes after the children were born are hung side-by-side with photos of them years later where they remain just as youthful and innocent-looking despite living in environments devastated by war and conflict. Separation of family is intermingled with the joy of a baby’s first steps. In an excerpt from a documentary on refugee families, a mother banters lightly with her husband as they decide what to name their newborn girl. He insists they name their daughter “Heln” instead of “Helen” because it sounds cooler. This light-hearted content is intermingled with reminders of the brutal situations refugees often find themselves in. At the back of the shipping container, in merely 10 square feet, are a thin mattress, some shoes, and a tiny shelf filled with bare necessities. The resemblance to actual refugee conditions in camps brings an onset of fearful apprehension. However, the photos full of childhood innocence and love remind us that hope can be a powerful thing.</p><p>Photoville is more than just a couple of shipping containers pushed together. It’s a place devoted to bringing the kind of content that lies off the beaten path, which usually means subject matter that is not only thought-provoking but challenging to grapple with. One of the first containers visitors see as they walk in is “Charlottesville and Beyond,” a line of portraits of participants at the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally. Among the lineup is a black-and-white photo of Jason Kessler, the organizer of “Unite the Right.” It’s not work that promotes white supremacy or a Nazi mindset; instead, it’s a documentation of history that should not be repeated. None of the photos put the ralliers in a positive or negative light. Beneath each of the portraits is a simple label with the subject’s name, what they do, and who took the photo. Viewers are left to interpret the photos on their own, and because little information is given, are forced to think of the ralliers as actual humans worth hearing out.</p><p>Photoville boasts such a large visitorship because it’s always looking to promote thought-provoking content. In many containers, signs are posted warning viewers about violent and graphic images. There is no such thing as family-friendly in a world where blood, sweat, and tears are common occurrences. Photoville strives to present work that doesn’t only follow mainstream media but brings attention to what isn’t deemed “newsworthy.” It alerts viewers to a fast-paced world that needs attention, and the documentation of its history to prevent worse things from happening.</p>	Article	67	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
648	﻿Artistic Appropriation on Wall Street: The Fearless Girl and Charging Bull Through the placement of “Fearless Girl,” “Charging Bull” is transformed into a symbol that goes against its artist’s intentions. <p>The “Charging Bull” appeared underneath a Christmas tree in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a gift to the city on the morning of December 15, 1989. This statue represented the largest and most famous work of Sicilian sculptor Arturo Di Modica.</p><p>Then, on the day before International Women’s Day of this year, the “Fearless Girl” appeared directly across from the Bull on the same stretch of Bowling Green. Immediately after it was unveiled, it received almost unanimous praise as an inspiration for women everywhere, signifying that they can achieve anything, in the face of every obstacle. However, there is at least one person who is not happy with the statue, and that is Arturo Di Modica.</p><p>Di Modica takes no issue with the intrinsic message of the statue, but he claims that it vilifies his own work. When Di Modica began work on the bull in 1987, Wall Street was just recovering from a crash the year before. He intended for the statue to symbolize the resilience of the American people and to be an ode to their strong work ethic. This message is amplified by the fact that in finance, a “bull market” is a market that is showing growth. Being in the heart of the financial district, its meaning was even more pronounced. Despite some of the connections requiring specialized knowledge, Di Modica wanted the bull to be something all could rally behind, regardless of their background.</p><p>With the addition of the “Fearless Girl,” the message of Di Modica’s work is radically changed. The “Fearless Girl” is daring, defiant, and, well, fearless. Her chin is up, despite the wind blowing against her dress, and she stares ahead with a confident gaze, unfazed by the challenges ahead. With the way the statues are positioned, the challenge she is unfazed by is Di Modica’s bull, which is charging right toward her. Economic growth and the resilience of the American spirit are not challenges for a little girl. On the contrary, these things are good and can help both women and men. Therefore, the bull’s challenge to the girl must represent something else, which means that the original meaning of Di Modica’s work has been changed.</p><p>Bulls are male cows and are often a sign of masculinity; they are aggressive, large, and virulent. Though it was not his intention, Di Modica’s work does lend itself to this interpretation. The bull’s muscles are rippling, its eyebrows are furrowed, and its nostrils are flared. Weighing over three and a half tons and reaching 18 feet, the bull is truly massive. Finally, as anyone who has viewed the bull surely knows, the bull was sculpted in an anatomically correct manner; that is to say, it has a penis and, as it is anatomically correct for bulls, quite large testicles. This turns Di Modica’s work into the perfect symbol of not only masculinity, but dangerous, rampant masculinity (as a charging bull is very dangerous). Now the bull is the obstacle the “Fearless Girl” must, and will, overcome.</p><p>While this makes for a charming narrative and a brilliant symbol for feminists, it is truly unfair to Di Modica. This is not what he intended his work to mean, and it is not what he wanted to see it relegated to. However, legally, the situation is difficult. The “Fearless Girl” is not physically altering the “Charging Bull,” and Mayor Bill De Blasio extended its permit through April of 2018. Yet, it is impossible to say that the “Charging Girl” has not altered the meaning of Di Modica’s work.</p><p>Ideally, the “Fearless Girl” would be beside the “Charging Bull” and looking in the same direction in which the bull charges. That way, the bull could retain its original meaning of American economic resilience, and the “Fearless Girl” would retain its message of female empowerment (but in the context of working with the bull, not against it). In fact, this furthers the intention of the investment firm that commissioned it, as they were promoting not only general female empowerment, but also gender equality in the field of finance. Of course, this solution has its own set of problems; if the “Fearless Girl” was simply moved besides the “Charging Bull,” it would block pedestrian flow, but it does seem to be the best solution, where everyone gets what they want (including the public, with two great works of art).</p>	Article	184	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
649	﻿The Rhombicosidodecahedron Drafting student designs fidget rhombicosidodecahedron as final project, then sells it and becomes a billionaire. <p>Final projects have been assigned by drafting teachers who are determined to torment their students. However, when drafting teacher Christopher Suter told his students the guidelines of the final project, he did not expect one of his failing students to design one of the most ingenious toys ever created: the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron.</p><p>“Needless to say, it was […] interesting,” Suter described. He declined to comment further, as he was busy fidgeting with the rhombicosidodecahedron.</p><p>Junior Michelle Yang’s fidget rhombicosidodecahedron is a masterpiece, with over 60 different gadgets designed to make pre-calc somewhat palatable. Yang has created an enormous black market by selling the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron in the girls’ bathrooms for $1.00. Within a day, Yang earned $50,000—not quite enough for a year of college tuition.</p><p>Some of the components of the toy include: a ball bearing to roll around, a pen clicker to click pointlessly, and a flat face that does absolutely nothing, but it feels nice, so there’s that. The rhombicosidodecahedron has an ingenious and ergonomic design and fits right in the palm of your hand, similar to a slightly small grapefruit.</p><p>Yet, with 420 faces, the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron has several unique features. For one, it has a portable printer. However, when someone tried to use it to print an entire textbook, printer functionality had to be disabled until further notice.</p><p>Another feature in progress has been the nuclear warhead side. Though testing is still required, a certain individual named Jim Kong-Dos has expressed interest. To our understanding, the U.S. government has deemed Stuyvesant a sufficiently depopulated area to conduct nuclear testing.</p><p>“I don’t know what possessed me to create the rhombicosidodecahedron,” said Yang in an e-mail interview. She failed to show up to school—in fact, she used the hologram feature of the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron to go to school for her. “For the first time since that multiplication worksheet back in third grade, I actually started working on the rhombicosidodecahedron the moment I got home. It felt like I was procrastinating on my other homework, but I’ve decided to put off caring.”</p><p>Regardless of what it was, the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron was obviously a success. Yang received an A for the class, and apparently, many of the purchasers of the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron have as well. Many teachers blame the “exam cheating” feature of the cube, but it’s obviously just the amazing de-stressing power of the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron.</p><p>Yang’s design for the fidget rhombicosidodecahedron shall be forwarded to the Fidget Company™, where production will begin immediately. The fidget rhombicosidodecahedron will be available in stores beginning August 2017, at the price of $599.</p>	Article	186	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
650	﻿Excuses for Being Late Excuses that explain why you were late to class. <p>School still starts at the unholy hour of 8 a.m., and the train delays can only cover your latenesses for so long. When the excuses start to run out, can you bear telling the truth—that you tried to fit 12 hours into half an hour—to your teachers? Of course not. So, here’s a list of excuses that you can give them instead.</p><p>MTA-related:</p><p>* “There was a giraffe on the train, and I had an allergic reaction to it.”</p><p>* “The 2/3 line was delayed, which made the 4/5 delayed, which made the H/X delayed, which delayed me.”</p><p>* “Someone was performing, and they kicked me in the depressor labii inferioris. I had to get medical attention.”</p><p>* “I dropped my math notes on the train track, and I spent about half an hour calculating the probability of death if I tried to get them. I eventually figured that it wasn’t worth it so I went home and rewrote them.”</p><p>* “An anti-vaxxer was on the train, so I couldn’t get on.”</p><p>* “A fat man decided to sit next to me and fall asleep on me on the train, and I wasn’t strong enough to push him off, so I could only get off when he did, which was the last stop.”</p><p>Weather-related:</p><p>* “There was too much sun, and as an overworked teenager, my skin is only accustomed to darkness.”</p><p>* “The temperature was below 80 degrees, and it was too cold. I have no fat since I haven’t eaten a meal since the first day of freshman year.”</p><p>* “It was very cloudy today and I don’t trust clouds since water is clear but clouds are white. I waited until the sun came out.”</p><p>Miscellaneous:</p><p>* “My printer ate my homework. It bit my hand when I tried to grab it.”</p><p>* “I tried running this morning before class. My head said yes, but everywhere else said no.”</p><p>* “To test g = 9.8 m/s2, I threw myself down the stairs and injured my right hand. I couldn’t swipe my MetroCard because it hurt so much and it took three hours to find someone who would help me.”</p><p>* “I thought my noisy alarm clock was my band class noodling, so I thought I was at school already.”</p><p>* “My parents emptied my entire bookbag because it was messy—I didn’t take notes anyway. I didn’t realize it until I got to the train station and refused to leave without my precious empty notebooks.”</p><p>* “If you round to the nearest hour, I got here on time.”</p><p>And finally, the most effective one:</p><p>The truth. Tell them why you were really late. Maybe you overslept because you spent all night studying for a test. Maybe you forgot to turn on your alarm. Maybe the trains were actually delayed. Teachers are not heartless; they’ve gone through school just like you. They’ll understand if you’re tired or your legs were sore so you couldn’t make it down the stairs in time. Instead of lying, why not just own up to it and make sure it doesn’t happen again?</p><p>Just kidding, don't do that—they’ll roast you. Please value your dignity.</p>	Article	189	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
651	﻿Renegades Defeat Curtis, Advance to Second Round  <p>Fresh off a successful 10-4 season, the Renegades, Stuyvesant’s girls’ softball team, earned the 13-seed and faced off against the 20th-seeded Warriors of Curtis High School (7-7) in the first round of the playoffs. With a second-round playoff loss still on their mind from last year, this game was one of revenge for the Renegades.</p><p>With great defense all around, timely hitting, and a strong performance by senior and co-captain Frankie Michielli (7 innings, one earned run), the Renegades won 3-2, staving off a comeback attempt by the Warriors to close the gap from 3-1 in the top of the seventh. “We made a lot of great plays in crucial situations today and hopefully we can continue to do that tomorrow against an even tougher team,” junior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl said.</p><p>The victory was a well-balanced one: the Renegades were able to manufacture runs and hold off the Warriors’s attempts to score, as Curtis only scored two runs despite 11 baserunners.</p><p>The damage started with a run scored by sophomore Ruby Gary in the bottom of the third on a wild pitch. As strong pitching and defense kept the Warriors at bay, the final two runs came off a two-RBI triple by Ruhl, which ended up being the difference in the tight affair.</p><p>The Renegades, who started off the season strong on offense, had since cooled off, only scoring 27 runs in their final four games of the regular season compared to 71 runs in the four games before those. “To start the season, most starters were making good contact, and we were having many double-digit-hit games. The offense has been doing well but not as strong as [it was] early on,” coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>Earlier in the season, the Renegades struggled with fielding. Their only other loss this season—against The Beacon School (7-6)—was a result of the errors made, with eight of the 12 runs allowed being unearned. The games against Manhattan Center were a frustrating reversion to the team’s earlier ways. “They are definitely a [defeatable] team, but unfortunately, the number of errors we had caused it to be really hard for us to have a comeback,” sophomore Ally Archer said.</p><p>Consistent fielding is something the Renegades must focus on if they hope to continue their run in the playoffs, and they were able to display that on Tuesday against Curtis. With fourth-seeded High School of Construction on the horizon, the Renegades have a big obstacle in their path to the championship. However, they certainly aren’t letting that stand in their way as they prepare. “[High School of] Construction is going to be the toughest opponent we will face all season, but if we play the way we've been playing I’m confident we can win,” Ruhl said.</p>	Article	192	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

I am impressed with how far this talented group of girls has come.”  —Lucia Liu, senior and co-captain</p><p>“Our Race Walk is always a strong event, and we got as many points as we could.” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>“The difference between fourth and seventh places were very small. The competition was very close and we could have been fourth or seventh.” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>“The captains were very supportive of their teammates” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>“Throughout the whole season, the girls performed really well and were striving for their personal best… I am hopeful that the Greyducks will place on the podium in all three seasons [next year].” —Dr. Markova, coach</p><p>--article starts here--</p><p>With summer around the corner, the girls’ outdoor track team finished another stellar season. The Greyducks started the season with two goals: to become back-to-back Manhattan borough champions, and to finish on the podium at the City Championships. With a strong performance in the field events, the girls accomplished their first goal, coming in first place in the Manhattan Borough Championship on May 21. But despite stellar individual performances at City Championships a week later on May 28, the Greyducks came in seventh place and could not reach the podium.</p><p>While it is true that the Greyducks didn’t come in the top three, it is also important to note that the difference in points between places is minimal. For example, a seventh place and a fourth place finish are less than ten points apart, as Dr. Markova, the coach of the girls’ team pointed out. “The difference between fourth and seventh places were very small. The competition was very close and we could have been fourth or seventh.”</p><p>Starting from their first meet on March 25, the girls’ track team had a very successful season. Though it started out slow, it quickly picked up: they dominated the 1500-meter racewalk at the Bob Zifchak Classic Meet on April 30, and the Spring Series meets on March 29, April 19, and May 2, largely due to sophomores Kayla Lew, Bernice Chen, and Jeanette Cheung, freshman Tina Zheng, and junior Joyce Wu. With such a strong team, even without the graduating seniors, next year is looking bright.</p><p>At the Mayor’s Cup on April 8, senior and star athlete Zovinar Khrimian came in first place in the 1500 meter race (5:06.81). The sophomore 4x800-meter relay team, composed of Clara Mohri, Tiffany Zhong, Jocelyn Tang, and Vivian Cribb placed an outstanding second place in the sophomore division. In addition, the freshman 4x800-meter relay team, which consisted of Doris Chen, Tiffany Cao, Jing Su, and Ester Suleymanov, placed fourth in the freshman division.</p><p>At the Manhattan Borough Championship on May 21, the Greyducks dominated the field events. At the start of the season, senior and co-captain Lucia Liu had hoped to strengthen the Greyducks’ performance in field events—which ended up being one of the reasons that the team performed so well. For example, junior Daria Shifrina came in first in both the high jump and triple jump, with a height of four feet, six inches and a distance of 32-01.50, respectively. Shifrina also came in third in the long jump, with a distance of 14 feet and seven inches. The Greyducks also dominated the pole vault with outstanding individual performances, with Liu taking first place, junior Venus Nnadi coming in second, and freshman Zoe Zakrzewska coming in fourth.</p><p>Senior Zovinar Khrimian and sophomore Clara Mohri also did extremely well in the track events. Mohri came in first in the 3000-meter race and third in the 1500-meter race. Khrimian came in second in both the 3000-meter race and the 1500-meter race.</p><p>All of this led up to the City Championships event at Icahn Stadium on Randall’s Island on Sunday, May 28. In the field events, Nnadi and Liu tied for 7th place in the pole vault with seven and a half feet. In the relay events, the 4x800 team, consisting of senior Catriona Breen, Khrimian, Mohri, and Cribb, came in third place just behind the Staten Island Tech team—an incredible accomplishment for the Greyducks. Khrimian said, “Everyone was in good spirits, especially at the end when the 4x800 [meter relay team] came in third in the city.”</p><p>The Greyducks also did well in the individual running events at the City Championships. Mohri came in fourth in the 3000 meter run with an impressive time of 10 minutes and 47.49 seconds, (10:47.49), and Khrimian also came in fourth in the 1500 meter run with a time of four minutes and 58.09 seconds (4:58.09).</p><p>Racewalking has always been a strong event for the Greyducks, and it was no different at the City Championships, where the Greyducks dominated the 1500 meter walk. Juniors Ziqi Guo and Joyce Wu also came in first and second places, respectively, with times of seven minutes and 31.41 seconds (7:31.41) and seven minutes and 35.28 seconds (7:35.28), respectively. Guo will be attending Nationals for a second time. As Dr. Markova said, “Our racewalk is always a strong event and we got as many points as we could.”</p><p>The highlight of the City Championships on May 28, however, was the fact that Stuyvesant’s own senior and co-captain Sharon Hu was honored as the winner of the PSAL 2017 Track & Field Scholar-Athlete Scholarship Award, which honors students’ outstanding achievements in the classroom, in the community and on the field. Hu was nominated by Dr. Markova as an athlete who demonstrated a commitment to excel in these areas. As the winner, Hu received an incredible $2,500 scholarship award for college.</p><p>The Greyducks’ accomplishments are no small feat. Unlike many other sports, most members of them team not only run on the outdoor track team, but also run cross country and indoor track, along with having to juggle the rigors of Stuyvesant with the demands of their daily practice throughout the school year. Even so, the Greyducks have again emerged as a force, and they have much to celebrate. As co-captain Liu aptly said, “With Stuy having such a rigorous curriculum, I have to admit it gets difficult at times balancing a demanding sport like track, where we are in season for the whole year. I am impressed with how far this talented group of girls has come.” Dr. Markova echoed these sentiments, emphasizing that “the captains were very supportive of their teammates,” and that “throughout the whole season, the girls performed really well and were striving for their personal best,” she said. “I am hopeful that the Greyducks will place on the podium in all three seasons [next year].”</p>	Article	164	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
782	﻿Greyducks Win 18th Consecutive Borough’s Championship The Greyducks won Borough’s, again. This is because of their practices, coaches, and game-day planning. <p>When the Greyducks, Stuyvesant’s boys’ track team, set out on this year’s outdoor track season, they were aiming for another Borough Championship. After a long and arduous season, the team succeeded, winning for the 18th consecutive year. It was not easy, as recently, Stuyvesant has faced fierce opposition from schools such as Hunter and the High School of Math Science and Engineering. However, the team was able to dominate once again.</p><p>Sprinters Sam Jung, Eric Cao, and Alex Schevshenko each placed first in their respective events. Schevshenko also set a school record in his first place 100-meter run with a time of 11.11 seconds. The team also came in first in two of its relays, the 4x100-meter relay and the 4x400-meter relay. The distance runners also triumphed with seniors and co-captains Greg Dudick and Kiyan Tavangar finishing first in the 3200-meter run and the 800-meter run respectively.</p><p>One reason for this major victory was the team’s physical preparation. Throughout the year, the team held indoor and outdoor workouts designed to challenge everyone’s physical and mental limits. It was here the Greyducks learned how to succeed. Senior and co-captain Noah Fichter said, “I think ultimately it comes down to the fact that our workouts are incredibly difficult, but everyone does them, and everyone does them with 100 percent of their energy.” In addition, Tavangar said, “Barely anyone has been missing practices, and everyone has been setting personal bests.” This combination of attendance and effort fueled yet another championship.</p><p>Besides preparation throughout the year, much of their success can be attributed to game day planning and strategy. “We spent hours planning out who to put in each event to score as many points as possible and block as many points as possible,” Fichter said. Similarly, Tavangar said, “Preparation always starts the night before, making sure we eat well and get a solid amount of sleep.” While many observers may think that the Greyducks only succeed because they happen to have the most athletic team, much more mental preparation goes on before each meet than meets the eye.</p><p>With all of these positives leading to their success, Stuyvesant has overcome a few setbacks this season in order to once again be champions of the borough. Numerous events have been rained out this season. This has given Stuyvesant’s runners less practice in competitive situations. In addition, the Greyducks added Coach Mankit Wong to the team, who has less experience than their previous coach, Coach Jeffrey Teta. However, Wong quickly became adjusted to the new sport and was a very effective coach. To help with this process, Teta still volunteered his time to help the runners during practices and games. Together, the two coaches proved to be an effective duo this season and led the team to victory.</p><p>At the end of the year, the Greyducks will lose their seniors, many of whom are vital members and act as leaders of the team. However, for the remaining members, Fichter said, “They certainly have the potential to take the team further than we have gone in past years, but they’re going to have to make adjustments.” When asked about who the team will rely on for next year, Tavangar acknowledged juniors Matt Fairbanks, Minhein Htet, Jesse Sit, Alex Schevchenko and Thomas Thread will need to step up. If the Greyducks continue their thorough preparation for their events and can execute on gameday, it is only a matter of time before we see them back on the podium at the Manhattan Borough Championships.</p>	Article	165	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
783	﻿Renegade’s Playoff Bid Cut Short to End Successful Season The Renegades finished up their season with a second-round 10-0 loss to High School for Construction, but they are optimistic for the upcoming season” <p>The Renegades, Stuyvesant’s girls’ softball team, finished off their season with a 10-0 loss to High School for Construction in the second round of the playoffs. In the first round, the Renegades defeated Curtis High School, despite having lost to them in last year’s postseason. Though off to a hot start at beginning of the year, the team struggled towards the end of the season and was unable to maintain its energy in the playoffs.</p><p>This lack of energy was apparent in the their loss to Construction; the team failed to ignite its offense which had been so explosive earlier in the season. Over the span of three games from late April to May, the team scored 56 runs. However, in the last four games of the season, the Renegades only put up nine runs, indicative of a decline in the offense.</p><p>Junior and co-captain Frankie Michielli attributed the lack of offensive productivity to the increase in tough competition. “[At] the end of the season, we definitely faced some tougher teams that gave us more competition than before,” she said. The last two games of the Renegades’ regular season were losses against the top two teams in their league, and after beating Stuyvesant, Construction advanced to the championship against Port Richmond High School.</p><p>During these games, the Renegades struggled against some of the top pitchers in the city, and their inability to perform well against fast pitching was capitalized on by their opponents. Junior and fellow co-captain Charlotte Ruhl agreed that for next year, the team will need to work on hitting against more skilled pitchers—the pitchers who not only throw hard, but work in three or four different pitch types.</p><p>One of the major issues the Renegades faced throughout the entire season was their defense. In the team's 12-2 loss to Manhattan Center, six of the 12 runs scored against the Renegades were on errors. “It was contagious; one error led to another and then another,” coach Vincent Miller said. Though they struggled early in the season, the Renegades worked to fix this and saw improvements. “Our defense got so so much stronger towards the end of the season,” Ruhl said.</p><p>The Peglegs were able to excel in their division this year because of their stacked lineup. Ruhl was one of the greatest contributors, leading the division in RBIs (34), standing second in runs (27), and fourth in home runs (5). Sophomore Talia Kirshenbaum brought a charge to the offense, hitting six home runs throughout the season despite an injury that limited her at the end of the season. In games where other aspects of play fell short, the offense saved the Renegades. “We had a bunch of come-from-behind wins because of our offense, ” Miller said.</p><p>In games where offense struggled for the Renegades, their pitching limited other teams and helped secure victories. In the Renegades’ first-round victory over the Curtis High School Warriors, Stuyvesant only managed to score three runs but Michielli held the Warriors to two runs. Michielli was dominant on the mound throughout the season, standing in third place in the division in wins (9) and fourth in strikeouts (76).</p><p>The Renegades will look to improve more upon their gameplay, but feel confident for next year. “It's the same group of girls because nobody is graduating, and we already have a great team dynamic,” Ruhl said. Having no players leaving the team will allow the Renegades to focus on their few weaknesses and progress further into the playoffs next year.</p>	Article	166	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
784	﻿Huskies Grab Impressive Victory The Huskies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ lacrosse team, won their first playoff game in recent memory before losing to Curtis in the next round. <p>“If you asked me in March if we'd win our first playoff game, I'd probably say no.” —Lucy Wang, senior and co-captain</p><p>“Through time, we learned how to run practices and manage game logistics (subs, plays, etc.) by ourselves.” —Lauren Moy, senior and co-captain</p><p>As the game came to a close, the ninth-seeded Huskies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ lacrosse team, realized what they had just accomplished. After going winless in the playoffs for the past five years and making the playoffs for the first time last year, the team managed to upset 8-seed Forest Hills High School 5-3. Even though they lost to the number one overall team and eventual runner up Curtis High School 15-6 the next round, the team did something that hadn’t been done in recent memory. No one saw their win coming, not even the team. “If you asked me in March if we'd win our first playoff game, I'd probably say no,” senior and co-captain Lucy Wang said.</p><p>The team faced adversity from the start, as their former coach, Jenna Gilbert, was replaced by coach Manuel Simon. While Simon stepped up and coached the team, he was not too familiar with the sport. His coaching responsibility fell on the captains. “Through time, we learned how to run practices and manage game logistics (subs, plays,!etc.) by ourselves,” Wang said. Another senior and co-captain, Lauren Moy, had a similar sentiment, saying, “We had to do a lot of the teaching and giving criticism during games, which was hard, since we’re also trying to be regular players.” Luckily, they were able to figure things out and keep their season going.</p><p>After a rough start to the season that included four straight rain-outs, the team rebounded and finished third in their division, Division 3, with a 10-4 record. Only Bronx High School of Science (12-2) and Hunter High School (14-0) finished ahead of them in the standings. This was the first year of Division 3, as previous years broke up teams by borough. Last year, the team finished 6-10 before losing to Tottenville in the first round of the playoffs 17-6. The year before that they did not qualify for a playoff berth.</p><p>A number of upperclassmen became major forces in the PSAL, but none improved as much as Wang. As an attacker/midfielder, Wang doubled the number of goals she scored from last season to this one, from 49 to 100. Her 100 goals scored led the PSAL, with the next closest person 23 goals behind her, at 77. Her leadership and goal-scoring was much needed, and her three goals in the playoff game against Forest Hills High School proved to be the deciding factors.</p><p>However, the win was more than just Wang. It was a team effort, especially by the seniors. “All the seniors in general are starters and have really shaped this team into something,” junior and co-captain Inbar Pe’er said. “When they were freshmen, it was no cuts, and they worked so hard to create a real team and a work ethic.” These seniors worked and bided their time, and after four years, they finally found success.</p><p>The team will suffer next year, with eight seniors leaving, including top goal-scorer Wang and goalie and co-captain Maddie Ostergaard. “A lot of the starting lineup consisted of seniors, so it'll probably be a tough adjustment,” Wang said. “But I think they can succeed.” They held many key positions on the field, and finding capable replacements will not be easy. Many underclassmen will have to improve and work hard to fill the spots on the roster vacated by the graduating class.</p><p>The team recently voted captains for next year, and decided on juniors Pe’er, Leila Storkamp, and Sara Ng. It could be a tough year, but if the team was able to weather a loss of a coach and a difficult beginning and still win a playoff game, getting back to this point next season is not out of the question. A young and athletic team, these Huskies could be just beginning to reach their peak.</p>	Article	168	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
785	﻿Promising Season Falls Short for Peglegs They  look toward the next one in hopes that they can continue the unprecedented progress they made over the past four years. <p>Down three runs to none with two outs in the bottom of the seventh, with junior Michael Gillow at the plate, the Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s baseball team, watched their season hang by a thread. Gillow worked up a full count and fought off some pitches, clearly determined to keep the game alive. Finally, after a formidable battle at the plate, Gillow made contact and hit a line drive to center field. As the ball entered the glove of the running McKee/Staten Island tech Seagulls’ center fielder, the Peglegs watched the most promising season in their recent history slip away. Final score, 3-0 Seagulls.</p><p>The Peglegs struggled with hitting throughout the entire game. It seemed as if they were making contact but simply couldn't find the holes in the opposing defense. As a result, the team only managed five hits in the game. Unfortunately, senior and co-captain Tobias Lange’s solid performance, in which he allowed just three runs in six innings and struck out five batters, was trumped by the absence of production on the offensive side of the ball for the Peglegs. When asked about the game, head coach John Carlesi said, “Everything went well but our hitting. Pitching was excellent, and we didn't make an error in the field. Unfortunately, their pitching held us to no runs, and I've never heard a team win while scoring zero runs.” The Seagulls scored one run in the first, third, and sixth innings, and that was enough to advance to the next round of the playoffs. “The last game was tough, knowing what most if these guys put into the team, the time, sacrifice and hard work; there wasn't a dry eye after that last out, including myself,” Carlesi said.</p><p>Despite the disappointing ending to the season, where the Peglegs expected to go deep in the playoffs, the team has quite a bit to be proud of. This was the best season under head coach John Carlesi, and the team won more games this year (12) than they won in the previous two seasons combined (10).  “I am disappointed in the early loss, but I am really proud of the way our team competed this year. Being the number 10 team in the city and the best team in Stuy history is nothing to be ashamed of,” senior and co-captain Jack Archer said. The season featured many memorable victories against difficult rivals—a victory against a Bayside team that was fresh off a championship victory, and a walk-off by senior Joseph Halim to defeat rival Beacon High School. “I would say beating Beacon on a walk off was the highpoint of our season. But to me, getting to spend all my time with this team has been the most rewarding part of the season. The baseball guys are like brothers. We have fed off of each other all year, and it has contributed to our success,” Archer said.</p><p>The strength of the pitching staff was a primary reason why the Peglegs fought their way to a successful season. Archer and senior and co-captain Tobias Lange had serious expectations of leading the team to success through their arms—and they did just that. The two were not only the best pitchers on the team, but they were two of the best in the AAA Western division. They each had five wins, tied for first in the division. Lange finished the season with 56 strikeouts and an earned run average (ERA) of 1.22. Archer was right behind him, finishing the year with 43 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.03. These statistics put these seniors among the best arms in the division. However, the offense and defensive contributions from many players on the team is what helped the Peglegs make a good season into a great one. Most importantly, “it was the team’s dynamics that really help during the season. The different personalities fed off one another in good times and bad. You couldn't ask for a better chemistry in a team,” Carlesi said.</p><p>Ultimately, as the peglegs reflect on the success and fun they had this season, they also look toward the next one in hopes that they can continue the unprecedented progress they made over the past four years. As Carlesi said and Archer seconded, “I'm hoping that Max Onderdonk, Jeremy Rubin and Malcolm Hubbell can lead this team next year. I can only hope they are up to the task.”</p>	Article	169	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
786	﻿“Concerned Stuyvesant Alumni” Boycott Alumni Association Over Issues of Transparency and Accountability Concerned Stuyvesant Alumni (CSA), a forum of alumni, announced a boycott of the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association (SHSAA) in protest of a alleged lack of transparency and accountability. <p>Concerned Stuyvesant Alumni (CSA), a forum of alumni, announced a boycott of the Stuyvesant High School Alumni Association (SHSAA) during the SHSAA’s Annual General Meeting on May 3, to protest an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. The forum is calling on alumni to donate directly to the school instead of through the SHSAA.</p><p>The SHSAA, a non-profit organization, funds programs and events within the Stuyvesant community, and holds events for alumni, primarily reunions. The SHSAA consists of alumni members who pay dues and have the right to vote and serve on the board, and basic members, alumni who do not pay dues but can take part in committees, without the right to vote or serve in leadership roles.</p><p>Tensions amongst alumni arose in 2013 and 2014 when two former alumni groups, the Friends of Stuyvesant (FOS) and Campaign for Stuyvesant (CFS), began efforts to merge with the SHSAA to form one alumni association for the school. During this period, the SHSAA adopted new by-laws related to the governance of the organization.</p><p>After the announcement of the merger process, many alumni began discussing their shared concern about the future of the organization. “[Our] efforts really began three years ago as more and more of us realized that we weren’t having a positive experience with the Alumni Association,” CSA member Nicholas Griffin (‘80) said. These alumni decided to create an informal forum, known as the CSA, where they could propose reforms and push for information about the by-laws. The CSA is not an actual organization with official members, and alumni associated with the forum primarily use Facebook to communicate with each other.</p><p>Many alumni contend that the merger negotiations were conducted without their knowledge and that the by-laws failed to increase transparency within the SHSAA. “SHSAA directors adopted new by-laws on September 11, 2013, and kept them secret until May 2014,” CSA member Dr. Jeff Golland (‘57) said in an e-mail interview. “These by-laws created an endowment and a board of trustees to run it within the SHSAA, but with nearly no accountability to the trustees. [...] Who the negotiators were was never made public.”</p><p>The SHSAA, however, claims that negotiation meetings were made public and that a lack of initiative on the part of certain alumni contributed to much of the confusion. “When we had an agreed upon framework, the representatives of the Association brought it back to the Board and membership for discussion and debate. That took place over a number of open and public Board Meetings.  Our meetings are open to all members and non-member alumni [...] I don’t recall any of the dissident members ever having come to a board meeting,” SHSAA President Soo Kim (‘93) said.</p><p>The CSA argues that further attempts to discuss the merger process were rebuffed by the directors of the SHSAA. “Those trustees were the leaders of the Campaign for Stuyvesant, and so when we discovered that, we [said] [...] that’s fine but give us more information about these trustees,” CSA member Neal Wilson (‘81) said. “The board got very tight-lipped and refused to answer any of our questions.”</p><p>The SHSAA responded by stating their procedure for electing trustees. “[The trustees] serve a longer term—six years as opposed to directors with three. They have a self-selection process that you might see in many non-profit bodies, such as the Harvard Corporation or most non-member charities. If the committee does not assent, the trustee candidate cannot serve," Kim said.</p><p>Further scrutiny by the CSA into the operations of the SHSAA prompted new concerns over the association’s budget and the allocation of funds. The SHSAA diverted funds from the funding of school clubs and teams in order to fund the establishment of an endowment. “We were confused, if the Alumni Association was not helping out with needs of the school, what were they doing?” Wilson said.</p><p>Although the SHSAA releases financial reports in the form of IRS 990C forms, as it is legally obliged to do, many alumni believe that the association should strive for greater accuracy and transparency. “IRS 990C forms are usually a year or two behind because they need to be based on audited financial information, and that takes time to complete. Volunteer organizations typically distribute (and often publish) a current financial report, and that’s what we have been asking the board to do,” CSA member Dr. Beth Knobel (‘80) said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>The CSA has also expressed dissatisfaction with the nomination and election process for leadership positions in the SHSAA. Current SHSAA board members are responsible for nominating future candidates, with each board member serving a term of three years.</p><p>“Applicants have to be dues-paying members of good standing, and must acknowledge they’re willing to meet our criteria for participation, giving, and best practices. They are evaluated on a number of criteria, [including] [...] how much they give in terms of time, how much they give in terms of money, and what they bring in terms of gravitas and experience, ” Kim said.</p><p>The CSA takes issue with this process, because they believe this allows the Board of Directors to eliminate candidates who disagree with the management of the association. “There was no competition, they could have been elected with one vote according to the bylaws. They had 850 votes out of 350,000 living alumni, and there was no one running against them,” Wilson said.</p><p>This year, SHSAA board members selected seven nominees for seven vacant positions. Members are also able to stand for elections by submitting a petition signed by a minimum of 50 alumni members or five percent of the total alumni members. No candidates, however, used the petition process this year.</p><p>In response to this criticism, the SHSAA noted that it reserved the right to determine the qualifying criteria for its leaders. “Every group has a right to enforce its own standards and that’s what you’re seeing.  Our volunteers work hard, they spend a lot of time and effort, and they enforce standards of the same high level of volunteerism amongst anyone [who] wants to join. Before you can express your opinion as to what you think will be good for the Association, you have to show that you contribute to the Association [...] and this is not about money, because by far the most valuable contribution is time,” Kim said.</p><p>Notwithstanding the claims of election malpractice, alumni currently associated with the CSA, including Dr. Knobel, have been elected to the Board of Directors in the past. Knobel resigned halfway into her term, however, to protest the SHSAA’s alleged attempts to prevent reform. “In my year and a half on the board, I tried to help the SHSAA improve. I ran the Communications Committee, and tried to improve newsletters and social media communication with alums,” Knobel said. “Those efforts were met with open hostility. I was badmouthed and even bullied for my efforts. One board member actually told me he hated me because I was pressing for the SHSAA to change.”</p><p>The CSA also argues that these restrictions on elections have been detrimental to the Alumni Association. “This is a public high school [...] Everything needs to be done in the light of day. If they were to adopt better practices with regard to nominations, access to the board, leadership; if they went beyond the nickel and dime attitude, they would actually be able to expand their membership. Their membership has actually been going down,” Griffin said.</p><p>Though the discourse between the two groups started with the CSA creating petitions and attending SHSAA meetings, hostilities heightened when the CSA began to make comments on the SHSAA Facebook page. The SHSAA responded by censoring the CSA’s comments. “I'm not allowed to post any comments on their Facebook page, as are all CSA people. All of our comments need to be approved before they're posted, and they don’t approve any of our comments, they leave them in pending status,” Wilson said.</p><p>This led to the creation of the CSA’s own Facebook page and website. Kim has joined the CSA’s Facebook page twice, in order to respond to concerns raised by the CSA.  “[Kim] didn’t answer our questions. [...] He joined the page for a week, essentially and created a lot of storm and controversy, and then quit the page, and then came back a few months later and did it again,” Wilson said.</p><p>The SHSAA justified their decision to remove select CSA members from their Facebook page, stating that the CSA had launched spam attacks on the page. “They have launched coordinated efforts where 20 of them repeat posts [...] on the Facebook page and what they’re trying to do is get us to delete their stuff or warn them and then ban them. We’ve fallen for it and we’ve banned them for violating the group rules and then they use that to say that we’re censoring them,” Kim said.</p><p>Tensions came to a head this month when the CSA decided to announce a boycott to protest the SHSAA. “We avoided this step for a long time [...] After three years trying to negotiate, we decided that there is a culture in the organization that is allergic to change,” Griffin said. “Three years is enough time to show their good faith and they haven’t [done so].”</p><p>The CSA called all members to divert funds from the SHSAA to other associations, such as the Parents’ Association, following an annual general meeting held on Wednesday, May 3, 201. “We are encouraging financial and other support [...] directly to the school, its departments, or individual student organizations.  We plan to keep at it until SHSAA returns to collaboration with its active membership, especially established reunion leaders.” Dr. Golland said.</p><p>Senior board members of the SHSAA are also beginning to resign from their positions. “About a whole dozen of board members [...] have walked out the door because they don’t like the way things are being run,” Wilson said.  The petition on the CSA website, which asks signees to divert donations and end their membership until the SHSAA implements change, currently has 204 signatures.</p><p>The CSA hopes that the SHSAA will soon be able to agree with their proposed reforms regarding accountability and transparency within the association. “[We want the SHSAA to] propose regular public reporting on dues and fundraising.  If fundraising is successful, leaders should want that to be known.  The silence suggests failure,” Dr. Golland said. The CSA would also like less money to go toward overhead such as salaries, which right now, makes up more than a third of donated funds</p><p>Regarding the election process, members of the CSA would like the SHSAA to have several more candidates than vacant positions. “Giving alumni choice of candidates to be their representatives is standard operating procedure at most alumni associations. Many of its own procedures, particularly the checks and balances [were] put in place by previous boards and legal counsel[s] to ensure good management,” Knobel said.</p><p>The SHSAA plans to move forward from this divide and continue to encourage alumni to give back to the association. “We have tried for years to engage them, as we have seen how schism and multiple organizations can hurt the community, but it has been fruitless. I don’t know if it’s possible to make them happy. I try to tell everyone in the Association not to take it personally and that is the nature of leadership and organizations," Kim said.</p><p>Despite the rift, the CSA looks forward to sitting down with the SHSAA to tap into the resources offered by Stuyvesant’s alumni. “There is so much more that can be done with the great people who have gone through 15th Street and Chambers Street over the decades that we can and should be doing,” Griffin said.</p>	Article	170	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
787	﻿Eric Contreras Appointed to Principal of Stuyvesant Former Interim Acting Principal Eric Contreras promoted to permanent principal. <p>Former Interim Acting Principal Eric Contreras was confirmed as the Principal of Stuyvesant High School on Friday, March 31. He served as the Interim Acting Principal for seven months following former Principal Jie Zhang’s retirement from the Department of Education (DOE) last year.</p><p>Contreras has an extensive background in the education field. He originally worked as a social studies teacher in the Bronx and Queens and moved on to become the Assistant Principal and Principal of the Queens High School of Teaching for seven years. Contreras also served as the Executive Director of Social Studies for New York City’s DOE.</p><p>After Contreras went through the C-30 process and became Interim Acting Principal, the DOE issued a posting for the permanent Principal position, to which Contreas and many others applied for.</p><p>The application for principal consisted of two main stages. In the first, a panel consisting of parents, students, and faculty interviewed applicants and selected the person whom they felt was the most qualified. In the second stage, the superintendent had to vet the chosen person.</p><p>“Frequently people would ask me, you know, are you anxious [for the interview], and the answer was actually, no I wasn’t. [...] So many great things and exciting things happen at Stuyvesant daily, [so] I never really had time to think [about] the interview process,” Contreras said. The superintendent named Contreras as the principal on March 31, after he passed through both stages of the application.</p><p>Contreras feels ecstatic to be appointed as principal, but also feels the same sense of mission he felt as an Interim Acting Principal. “I was extremely excited, happy, and honored, but [the confirmation] didn’t change my work. I was waking up with a sense of obligation before I became appointed, and I was waking up with a sense of obligation after I became appointed. [...] The initiatives I’m working on [...] [didn’t change] from the day before I got appointed to the day after,” he said.</p><p>Contreras is currently undertaking many initiatives to improve Stuyvesant, including an effort to strengthen the research program. “One thing I did was bringing together research coordinators, alumni, and teachers [who] had some input on what had worked in the past and we had developed a very strategic plan around strengthening our research program,” he said. “We had a research panel event, we put together parent research night, we collaborated with a number of nonprofits, and I held meetings with labs to see if they would open up space for our [students].”</p><p>Additionally, Contreras plans on improving the technology and engineering programs at Stuyvesant. Amongst the proposed changes are plans to expand current courses and create new ones tailored around subjects such as aerospace engineering, engineering design, and mechanical engineering.</p><p>Contreras is also actively working with Parent Coordinator Dina Ingram to foster a sense of community amongst the parents. “We have put together a series of parent events, wellness events, and parent meetings,” he said. In addition, Ingram is also working to create a bi-weekly publication that covers day-to-day activities and student events for parents to read.</p><p>Contreras hopes that his changes help bring about a unique and versatile experience to each student. “There is a complexity to a [Stuyvesant] student that is second to none so the formula to [create] a great STEM school [is] to allow learning across all disciplines,” he said. “ If you want complex thinkers, you need to create a complex experience.”</p>	Article	171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
788	﻿Stuyvesant Holds First Japan Day Festival The first annual Japan Day was hosted on May 5. There were some difficulties that are expected to be addressed in the future. <p>The fifth floor buzzed with 500 students lining up to don sumo suits, learn the art of Bon dancing, and decorate the walls with their wishes for Tanabata, the Japanese Star Festival, in celebration of Stuyvesant’s First Annual Japan Day on Friday, May 5. The event was organized by Japanese teacher Chie Helinski and an organizational cabinet of junior students to showcase various aspects of this culture.</p><p>Assistant Principal of the World Languages Dr. Ernest Oliveri has assisted teachers in organizing festivities, such as the Día de los Muertos Celebration and the Chinese New Year Festival throughout this year.</p><p>The event was conceived after these celebrations, when Ms. Helinski began brainstorming a Japanese cultural event. Much of the inspiration for the event stemmed from Japandemonium, an annual celebration of Japanese culture already held in the Japanese classes. Kodomo No hi, or Children’s Day, was suggested as the date to schedule the event.</p><p>“We needed to prepare the decorations, make sure we had enough food, and also organize how the extra credit was going to work,” junior and President of the Cabinet Liz Lee said.</p><p>The event offered various activities for attendees. “We wanted to make it more hands-on so we formed a committee of students which focused some events on craft. We added [a thousand] origami cranes around the poster of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [as] that’s culturally done. [In Japan,] for New Year’s, people go to shrines. They get fortune readings. So, we organized fortune readings for students. July 7 is the Star Festival. It's a big international holiday and celebration. [The Japanese] make [Tanabata] wishes on paper. So we did just that,” Helinski said.</p><p>The event was positively received by many students. “I entered the raffle right away. The food and sweets were amazing. I really enjoyed watching the festivities and participating in some of the events that I only saw in movies, like writing down my wishes. It was even better because lots of my friends went, though extra credit really helped convince them to go,” sophomore Anne Zhang said.</p><p>The festival attracted a large volume of people, causing some issues for organizers. “Although I had fun, after 10th period, the hallways were really crowded and it was a little overwhelming. At one point I just wanted to leave because there were so many people, ” Zhang said.</p><p>Organizers addressed these concerns of overcrowding and difficulties in planning. “We ran out of food really fast, and some decorations were being teared off, not intentionally of course, as people were pushed against walls with the lack of space,” sophomore Dillan Blake said.</p><p>The Japanese department has already begun looking to next year’s celebration to make further improvements to the festival. “It [will] definitely [be] in the cafeteria next year with probably a megaphone to talk to the whole crowd,” Helinski said.</p>	Article	172	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
829	﻿Three Solutions for Canada’s Mounting Refugee Crisis Canada’s current acceptance of refugees creates a threatening backlog of people who might be turned away at a moment’s notice. <p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted, “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength[.] #WelcomeToCanada” in January. Compare this to President Donald Trump, who tweeted, “I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016” just a year before. Canada currently has an immigration policy that is much more permissive of refugees, which has led to a mammoth influx of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, with around 10,000 coming across the border in July alone. While Canada welcomes these refugees with open arms, strain is showing—there is currently a backlog of over 40,000 refugees awaiting hearing, with some having arrived before 2012. In Quebec, the province with the most displaced people, the refugee acceptance rate has fallen as low as 50 percent over the last year. There, the city of Montreal has set up 1,500 beds to be filled with displaced immigrants, half of whom could be turned away.</p><p>Canada has its heart in the right place, and I propose three policy solutions for this problem of immigration.</p><p>First, the process that grants hearings to refugees should be less rigorous. These types of reforms have been played with in the past, such as when Parliament drafted and passed legislation that removed the requirement for lengthy hearings for refugees from seven Middle Eastern countries, including Yemen and Burundi, in response to humanitarian crises there. This legislation could be extended to the bulk of refugees with great success, as it removes the need for the longest part of the vetting process.</p><p>However, while the legislation didn’t have any noticeable drawbacks then, some would argue that expanding immigration policies to allow a much greater number of refugees might allow entrance to some with dubious refugee status or a prior criminal record. For instance, in response to an increasing number of Somali criminal deportations from the United States, a small number of criminals from Somalia have been claiming refugee status and coming across the border under false identities. But these examples are the exception rather than the norm, and the reward of productive new members of society would outweigh the risk of a few criminals.</p><p>Next, Trudeau should put his money where his mouth is and increase funding for the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), with the only real downside being the cost. Because such a large scale migration from the U.S. is completely unprecedented, Canada’s system is unprepared for the number of immigrants coming across the border. The Board currently only has enough manpower to hold a maximum of 24,000 hearings per year, not nearly enough for the thousands that cross the border monthly. Furthermore, the costs would be offset by the economic benefits: getting immigrants and refugees employed and paying taxes as permanent residents as quickly as possible. It’s irresponsible for Trudeau to welcome such a large amount of immigrants into a country that isn’t ready to handle them. He needs to make sure that Canada is able to accept them as quickly as possible.</p><p>The last option for Canada might be counterintuitive, but it may in fact alleviate a lot of the strain on the system: limiting the flow of refugees until the backlog has been resolved. Canada can actually take it more slowly than many think. Over 90 percent of deportations are done in states that don't border Canada. Thus, it's possible for Canada to temporarily limit or cease refugee action across the border until the situation becomes more manageable. Of course, there would be exceptions, such as a response to the recent threats from the Trump administration against Haitian refugees living in America, 8,500 of which crossed the Canadian border in August. Limiting the flow of immigrants and letting specific, threatened groups through buys time for the system to fix the mounting backlog and stop the type of bureaucratic limbo that 40,000 people are living in today. However, this is a temporary fix on its own, because when the backlog is eliminated Canada will have two choices: go back to their previous policy and let it mount up again, or stick to the less permissive one, a secondhand version of America’s much harsher policy towards illegal immigrants.</p><p>The third solution cannot stand alone. Instead, it’s designed to create a blank slate for the implementation of one or both of the other two solutions and prioritize the vetting of those who have waited for years to be recognized as members of society. The current backlog is the most pressing issue right now and the people it’s made of deserve to be put through the system first, but if refugees are to be limited until the backlog is gone, Canada needs to adopt either or both of the other solutions to streamline the immigration progress. Canada must first stabilize the system by fixing the backlog, but after that, Trudeau must either do away with a portion of the vetting process or give more money to the struggling IRB if he wants to realize his vision of a truly welcoming Canada.</p>	Article	227	2017-11-30 09:32:14.625418	2017-11-30 09:32:14.625418
831	﻿Russia Again? Speculation concerning the “Russia scandal” has taken up an incredulous amount of their attention, and allowed for the neglection of arguably larger issues afflicting our nation. <p>After months of endorsements and almost $1.4 billion spent on campaign expenditures, a Hillary Clinton victory in the 2016 election seemed like a sure thing. Donald Trump’s shocking triumph took the whole country by storm; immediately after results were announced, Democrats rushed to invalidate them. Cries of collusion with Russia deemed the victory as undermining to American democracy. Lacking in substance as well as relevance, claims of Russian election interference still plague the Trump administration almost a year later. Though recent investigations have recovered definitive ties between Russia and a campaign, it certainly wasn’t Trump’s.</p><p>American Majority CEO Ned Ryun, who extensively investigated claims of collusion,  assured that "the same Russian lawyer who allegedly met with Trump’s son discovered that she [Clinton] was actually one of the unnamed sources for the Russian dossier." Clinton’s campaign (along with the DNC) essentially funded opposition research to be done by Fusion GPS, a foreign firm, and for it to be released as maliciously as possible in order to smear the Trump campaign. The organization is now in a legal battle with the United States government for refusing to show their bank records.</p><p>Clinton also tried to keep her campaign off the name of the organizations who funded the dossier. Studies by Mother Jones indicate that talk of the dossier had been around ever since October 2016, on which it was very vaguely put that the effort was “originally funded by Trump’s GOP opponents.” When it emerged in October 2017 that a very significant benefactor had, in fact, been the Clinton campaign, the dossier had already sparked much of the media’s attention. Clinton’s involvement was often de-emphasized by media trying to push a narrative that antagonized Trump.</p><p>But these sort of unethical tactics stretch all the way back to Clinton’s time with the Obama administration. From 2009 to 2013, Russia was trying to monopolize the uranium market by gaining control of a substantial amount of all uranium production capacity on American territory. Since uranium purchases have implications on national security, they must be approved by a committee composed of representatives from the United States government. Amongst those representatives was the Secretary of State at the time, Hillary Clinton.</p><p>As Russians gradually assumed control of uranium production, Canadian records showed that an unprecedented cash flow made its way into the Clintons’s pockets. The chairman of Uranium One made four separate donations to the Clinton Foundation, totalling a whopping $2.35 million. Despite an agreement struck with the Obama administration to publicly identify all donors, this information remained disclosed until now.</p><p>Trump’s connections to Russia, in contrast, appear rather mild. His son, Donald J. Trump, met with a Russian lawyer during the heat of the campaign season. Other than a rather inconclusive e-mail and some false claims of the lawyer having access to “damaging information about Clinton,” the meeting was arguably none other than poorly handled opposition research. The lawyer ultimately didn’t provide the promised material on Clinton, and Trump Jr. fully disclosed the e-mails in a later tweet.</p><p>Even though this event was what began the Trump-Russia controversy, Trump’s campaign (and his presidency) was marred by many such dubious accusations. National Secretary Advisor Flynn—who has since been fired—was said to have communicated with Russian officials; however, the president wasn’t aware of nor directed any of the efforts Flynn potentially made. Even Trump’s meeting with Putin to simply discuss American-Russian relations at the G-20 summit was used as viable evidence of an unseemly alliance. According to “The Atlantic,” accounts from the meeting state, “Trump had pressed Putin hard about Russian interference.” The rest of the time was dedicated to talks of resolution for the conflict in Syria.</p><p>Trump’s administration is forced to spend time defending themselves against allegations, which can be better used to defend the country. Clinton’s goal was never to warn the American people of Russian collusion, which she’s been building up as the biggest threat to American democracy, and a force that shouldn’t be reckoned with. But maybe the biggest manifestation of this sort of corruption is Clinton herself; after all, she got herself more profit and Trump more bad publicity than ever before.</p><p>Months after the controversy, media outlets have exhausted the topic of Russian intervention in the election. Speculation concerning the “Russia scandal” has taken up an incredulous amount of their attention; in one airing of CNN’s “New Day,” 93 percent of air time was devoted to Russia and less than five percent was spent on the GOP’s new healthcare bill. This misdirected focus allows for the neglection of arguably larger issues afflicting our nation. Between some flimsy links and a suspicious e-mail exchange, there appears to be nothing of substance in regards to the Trump campaign’s involvement with Russia—that alone should have been very clear months ago.</p>	Article	229	2017-11-30 09:33:54.413134	2017-11-30 09:33:54.413134
835	﻿What to Bring Back to Broadway A look at five shows that are due for a Broadway revival. <p>With musical remakes of “SpongeBob” and “Mean Girls” on their way to Broadway, theater followers have reason to be both skeptical and excited about the 2017-2018 Broadway season. In addition to these new productions, shows including “Carousel” and “Once On This Island” have returned to the spotlight. In satisfying the demand for iconic and nostalgia-inducing hits, revivals play a key role in keeping the theater industry alive. With today’s ever-changing social and political climate, returning shows can take on a new meaning and reiterate the importance of issues that have now become prevalent. Here’s a selection of shows that would rake in audiences and convey powerful messages if revived on Broadway.</p><p><b>Next to Normal</b></p><p><i>2009</i></p><p>Written by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, “Next to Normal” ran on Broadway for two years and earned three Tony Awards, as well as the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Centered around a mother with increasingly severe bipolar disorder, the musical stands out by providing a raw and honest depiction of how an individual and those around him or her can be affected by mental illness. Showing a range of perspectives, from that of overachieving and neglected daughter Natalie to frustrated yet determined husband Dan, “Next to Normal” stands out because it allows audiences of all ages and denominations to see themselves represented on stage. Many audiences were also intrigued by the show’s many parallels to “Dear Evan Hansen,” the musical that won this year’s Tony Award for Best Musical. With the issues of mental illness and dysfunctional family relationships constantly growing in prominence, a “Next to Normal” revival would increase awareness surrounding these issues and also further touch on the importance of not romanticizing poor mental health and treating it like any other chronic illness.</p><p><b>A Chorus Line</b></p><p><i>1975/2006</i></p><p>An iconic staple of musical theater, “A Chorus Line” follows the story of 17 dancers auditioning for a spot in a Broadway musical. After winning the Tony Award for Best Musical in 1975, the production was later revived in 2006, and many believe that it is due for another return to Broadway. One of the longest-running and more well-known musicals, a revival of “A Chorus Line” would be received with significant enthusiasm from fans of classic musical theater and balance the ratio of classic to contemporary and current shows that are trendy today. Centered around a critical element of showbusiness, the audition, the show depicts a timeless struggle that all performers can commiserate with. With all the elements of a standard Broadway musical, “A Chorus Line” would spark a renewed enthusiasm for more traditional shows and tell a heartfelt and timeless story to its viewers.</p><p><b>In the Heights</b></p><p><i>2008</i></p><p>Years before Hamilton’s rise to popularity, another musical by composer Lin-Manuel Miranda gained attention after it opened in February of 2008. Telling the story of three days in the life of a close-knit Latino community in Washington Heights, “In the Heights” was given the 2008 Tony Award for Best Musical. The production was criticized for its overly sentimental dialogue, but praised for its high energy and spirited score. The show also broke barriers by being one of the first major hip-hop musicals. In an industry that is dominated by tap dancing and big choral numbers, “In the Heights” stands out by bringing a different and exciting element to the stage. A return to Broadway could attract the attention of fans of “Hamilton” who want a show with a similar hip-hop influence. The themes of “In the Heights” are also especially relevant to the country’s current political tension. With many nods to the hardships and discrimination that surround the immigration process, a revival of “In the Heights” could speak volumes with its strong statements about issues that are extremely prominent in today’s society.</p><p><b>Heathers: The Musical</b></p><p><i>2014</i></p><p>Though never actually running on Broadway, the “Heathers” musical remake received considerable praise from audiences and fans of the 1988 cult classic film. The production’s dark yet humorous plot follows 17-year-old Veronica Sawyer, as she and her boyfriend accidentally murder the leaders of her popular clique in an effort to reduce her high school’s social tension. If finally given a Broadway run, the musical could rake in attention from younger audiences who yearn to see more representation of the high school experience on stage. With a catchy score and witty humor, the black comedy is sure to keep viewers entertained for a full two hours. Though the Off-Broadway production was positively received, many remarked that the show’s low budget resulted in an overly simple set design. A Broadway production of “Heathers: The Musical” would allow for a more dynamic set that would pair well with the other vibrant elements of the show, such as the soundtrack and heavily ‘80s-influenced costumes. Satisfying both lovers of the iconic film and teens that can relate to the show’s themes about the struggles of fitting in in high school, “Heathers: The Musical” is sure to be a hit if brought to Broadway.</p><p><b>Into the Woods</b></p><p><i>1987/2002</i></p><p>One of the many masterpieces of famed composer Stephen Sondheim, “Into the Woods” puts a dark spin on beloved fairy tales such as “Cinderella” and “Little Red Riding Hood.” Their whimsical storylines intertwine, as various characters journey on different quests through a threatening and mysterious forest and eventually team up to fight a murderous giant. Opening on Broadway in 1987, “Into the Woods” was later revived in 2002 and adapted into a film in 2014. Though the show has achieved large success on its many runs, many theater enthusiasts wish to see it make a comeback. Sondheim’s musicals are known for their fast-paced and tongue-tying scores, and “Into the Woods” is no exception. A notable favorite from the show is “Giants in the Sky,” a song that is known for being vocally hard to execute. If given a chance to make a resurgence, “Into the Woods” is sure to draw in those looking for a well-thought out musical with a story that is wild from start to finish.</p>	Article	233	2017-11-30 09:50:23.970154	2017-11-30 09:50:23.970154
833	﻿“Stranger Things” Brings Tubular Things to Season 2  <p>Suspenseful music cues in as four boys decked out in tan jumpsuits with proton packs stand outside their middle school and stare agape in horror at the scene before them. It is Halloween morning and their day has already gone dramatically awry as more and more kids dressed in casual school clothes pass by. A gut-wrenching realization dawns upon the group as Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) dismayingly utters what they are all thinking: “Why is no one else wearing costumes?”</p><p>This scene is just one of many comical moments from the second season of “Stranger Things.” Iconic for its Eggos, nose-bleeds, and Christmas lights hung above the alphabet painted in black on a wall, the Netflix original series induced a global storm in pop culture ever since its debut over a year ago. Having a distinct nostalgic ‘80s vibe, “Stranger Things” has garnered a massive fan base by attracting old and new generations alike. The second season aired in late October with a whopping 16 million people watching the night of its much-anticipated premiere.</p><p>The story centers around the comradery between four boys, each with their own unique personality. Dustin, who is goofy yet protective, Will (Noah Schnapp), who is soft-spoken and kind, Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), who is pragmatic and serious, and Mike (Finn Wolfhard), who is optimistic and thoughtful, all band together in the pursuit to undertake evil.</p><p>Set in Hawkins, a fictional small town in Indiana where, presumably, nothing ever happens, everything changes one day when Will mysteriously disappears and the other three encounter Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), a girl with bizarre telekinetic powers who escaped the notorious Hawkins lab. Through her, they discover the presence of another dimension, the Upside Down, which is just like their world, but barren, dark, and teeming with Demogorgon monsters. Season one ends on a cliffhanger, with Eleven disappearing after killing the evil Demogorgon and a newly-retrieved, frazzled Will covertly coughing up a infantile Demogorgon, setting up the stage for what is to happen in season two.</p><p>The audience is introduced to a lively new set of characters in the second season. Max (Sadie Sink), a tough, skateboarding, and easily irritable redhead from California joins the boys on their adventures in navigating the mysteries of the Upside Down. Along with her character comes a wild and irredeemable step-brother, Billy (Dacre Montgomery), who poses as the town’s new human antagonist. We then are introduced to a less tangible, but ultimately more dangerous villain, the Shadow Monster—a gargantuan, faceless shadow that roams the Upside Down and threatens the human world with havoc and chaos.</p><p>Besides the introduction of these new characters, the second season differs from the first in that the story unfolds through individual storylines. Though there is less of a sense of comradery than there was in season one, the script delves deeper into each character.</p><p>The season is marked with an abundance of growth from the characters, as opposed to the first season, which mainly introduces the characters and plot. For one, Will, who appears in season one on only a few occasions, has a drastically greater involvement in season two. He becomes the physical link between the two dimensions, causing the other characters to worry endlessly and creating moving scenes as he battles the Shadow Monster’s attempts to possess him.</p><p>Steve Harrington, whose character in season one was merely portrayed as Nancy’s jock of a boyfriend, plays a much larger, more multidimensional role in season two. He is no longer “King Steve,” as known by those in his high school, and he discovers a new role as a guardian of the group—especially Dustin, who he helps not only in defeating multiple Demogorgons, but in navigating teenagehood as well.</p><p>Perhaps the most stunning growth comes from Eleven. In season one, she was portrayed as almost alien-like, always donning a hospital gown or an awkward a blonde wig and a pink dress of a costume. This season, we see her as a teenage girl trying to navigate a world that doesn’t quite accept her. To reconcile with her past, she ventures off to find her mother and her long-lost sister, Kali, whom she was separated from at the lab as a toddler.</p><p>The cinematography proves to be bigger and more ambitious than the previous season. The scenes embody ‘80s nostalgia, shot with a soft lense comparable to the equipment commonly used in ‘80s cinema. The set and costumes not only perfectly embody the nostalgia of ‘80s, but are very specifically mapped out to give us insight into the personality of each character.</p><p>For instance, the political allegiance of each of the boy’s parents during the ‘84 presidential election were shown in the signs on the front lawns of their houses. Mike’s parents, who are wealthier and much removed from his adventurous pursuits, showed allegiance to Reagan, while Dustin’s single, quirky, cat-loving mother showed allegiance to the campaign’s underdog, Mondale.</p><p>More references to that era include homages to classic films. The Shadow Monster was heated out of Will’s body in the fashion of “The Exorcist” (1973), Steve and Dustin walking on railroad tracks resembled a scene from “Stand By Me” (1986), and the group’s halloween costumes were of the squad from “Ghostbusters” (1984), whose theme song played on several occasions. Kali’s gang in the standalone episode was inspired by the gang from “The Warriors” (1979), and Joyce Byers’s (Winona Ryder) dorky boyfriend Bob Newby (Sean Astin) references the ‘X’ on a map as pirate treasure, as Mike Walsh (Sean Astin) does in “The Goonies” (1985).</p><p>The show’s soundtrack also features many songs from the time period such as “Whip It” by Devo and “Time after Time” by Cyndi Lauper. It is unusual yet refreshing to see the world of the ‘80s conveyed with modern special effects and by actors born in the 2000s.</p><p>In only nine hour-long episodes, the second season of “Stranger Things” managed to tie up all of the loose ends left from season one while also telling a story of unlikely allies, complex romances, dealing with grief, and the integrity and purity of a friendship between four boys.</p><p>Though they are growing up to not play as much Dungeons & Dragons, and their battle with the Upside Down grows to a much larger scale than in season one, the story always manages to stay rooted in these lovable characters.</p>	Article	231	2017-11-30 09:38:44.749171	2017-12-03 19:43:48.502299
646	﻿To Gay or Not to Gay: The Evolution of Queerbaiting A thinkpiece on a controversial practice in mainstream media and how it has evolved overtime. <p>To gay, or not to gay? That is the question asked by producers and executives in the entertainment industry as queer representation in mainstream film and television becomes more normalized.</p><p>While onscreen appearances of queer characters used to be considered groundbreaking, risqué, and highly controversial, they are now considerably commonplace and a popular way to “diversify” a cast.</p><p>This summer alone, two blockbusters geared toward child audiences, “Power Rangers” and “Beauty and the Beast,” featured confirmed gay characters. Spy movie “Atomic Blonde” was led by queer female characters, and “Wonder Woman,” the origin story of America’s favorite bisexual superheroine, broke box office records.</p><p>While this seems to be ample queer representation, most of it only appeared in the marketing of the films and not in the actual films themselves. The only movie of these four to truly portray a same-sex relationship was “Atomic Blonde,” and it was hypersexualized to appeal to the male gaze. Moreover, the main character’s same-sex love interest, brutally killed off in a careless manner, was treated as a disposable object. Queer, especially queer female, characters are killed off in movies and television shows so frequently that there’s a name for it—the “bury your gays” trope.</p><p>In the other three movies, there was little to no queer representation. In “Power Rangers,” there were only slight implications in a brief onscreen moment that the yellow ranger could be a lesbian. The flamboyant LeFou of “Beauty and the Beast” was not much more than a messy conglomeration of stereotypes; the only actual indication of his sexuality was located in his two-second-long dance with a man in the credits. Though Wonder Woman was confirmed as bisexual by DC Comics, the “Wonder Woman” movie does not acknowledge this aspect of her character at all.</p><p>Yet, these movies widely marketed these subtle nods to the queer community as “gay characters,” “gay moments,” and “exclusively gay,” giving the impression that queer representation was a central aspect of these films. They primarily did this for three reasons: to pretend that they care about diverse representation, to be radical and groundbreaking, and to attract a large queer following.</p><p>The act of marketing a movie or TV show to appeal to the queer community without thoughtfully portraying queer characters is called “queerbaiting.” Queerbaiting has been a frequent practice in mainstream media for quite some time. It was coined on the internet by queer fanbases in the 2000s and has since evolved as the entertainment industry adapts to a rapidly changing political climate.</p><p>The term was first widely used to describe the subtextual relationships between two male characters in “Sherlock” and “Supernatural” and the similarly subtextual relationships that evolved in television shows like “Merlin,” “Once Upon a Time,” and “Rizzoli and Isles.”</p><p>These shows would acquire a queer following by purposefully portraying same-sex platonic relationships with slightly romantic undertones. Producers, directors, showrunners, and even actors would acknowledge the possibility of these relationships to keep fans on edge, but would never make them a reality.</p><p>While these television shows have had no problem enticing fans with subtextual same-sex relationships, they have been averse to explicitly portraying them because of the potential controversy and lowering in ratings. They use the queer community for optimal viewer numbers and ratings, treating them as a commodity.</p><p>However, the growing desire for legitimate, thoughtful representation has compelled many people to speak out against queerbaiting, warning fans not to fall for these tricks. With queer subtext yielding less and less success, producers turned to the next trick in the book—the “bury your gays” trope—introducing queer characters, effusively promoting them, and then quickly disposing of them.</p><p>The CW’s “The 100” advertised the relationship between two female characters masquerading as fervent advocates of the queer community in March 2016, and then abruptly and recklessly killed off one of these characters. The showrunner and writers were met with an overwhelmingly negative reaction from fans, and viewership plummeted. Since then, awareness of “bury your gays” and “lesbian death syndrome” have spread, and they have become less common—though not completely extinct—practices.</p><p>That brings us to where we are now. In a sociopolitical climate more tolerant of queer media representation than ever before, gay characters are able to exist without dying, but they still don’t have any real onscreen presence. Lesbian couples are two women briefly shown standing next to a stroller in “Finding Dory,” and if you look closely enough, you may see two men dancing in the background of the credits of “Beauty and the Beast.”</p><p>Positive representation of the queer community becomes more prevalent each year, with movies like “Moonlight” and “Carol” and TV shows like “The Bold Type,” “Shadowhunters,” and “Orange is the New Black,” but queerbaiting is far from a dying practice. To treat queer fanbases as disposable commodities is demoralizing and dehumanizing and perpetuates negative attitudes and opinions of the queer community.</p><p>I’m not going to be naïve and pretend that Hollywood cares more about making art than making a profit, but it wouldn’t hurt the film and television industries to tell a story that has not yet been told—the story of a queer person who is more than a one-dimensional character, the punchline of a joke, or a brief cameo. Better yet, tell the story of a trans person. Well-developed trans and nonbinary storylines are seldom present in mainstream media.</p><p>If stories don’t involve the LGBTQ+ community, they shouldn’t be advertised as such. Instead of letting queerbaiting continue to manifest in new ways, we should end it altogether.</p>	Article	69	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2018-01-13 14:46:18.796267
652	﻿Humans of New York: Lessons for the World A think-piece about how Humans of New York (HONY) compensates for what’s lost in mainstream news sources and how it combats our “culture of extremes.” <p>Think back to one of HONY’s portraits from April, with a caption about a Colombian boy who wants to be an archaeologist and hunt for “dinosaur eggs and Egyptians.” Think back to a portrait caption from 2013, in which a woman is told by her dying husband, “take the love you have for me and spread it around.” Think of the portrait about a boy who seized the perfect moment during a movie to ask his crush out on a date. Whether these stories are heart-warming or poignant, they aren’t covered by the news. They should be.</p><p>In the midst of political and international strife, it’s more important now than ever that we begin to understand and accept the stories of those all around the world. Stanton’s work is, for us, a raw and effortless way to find meaning and relatability in other people’s lives. It’s time we make more human connection. Whether it be through HONY’s long captions, the images themselves, or the thousands of Facebook comments that follow each post, there is always a message that can be extracted, or some sort of connection we can make. Through words and pictures about others, we’re getting to know these people, we’re feeling emotions that they’ve felt, and we’re learning from their lives—how things they’ve done or gone through can be lessons and shared experiences for us.</p><p>HONY isn’t just an outlet for entertainment or a pastime; I, for one, hope that it ends up being the future of journalism. The news nowadays tells us about one domestic and foreign disaster after the next, but I hope that more news sources begin to tell us the truly “good” stories: stories from which we can understand that our world is not doomed to hell, and that if we have conflicts that we need to resolve, we must do so by making human connections and coming together—not by viewing the rest of our world through a lens of separation.</p>	Article	14	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
653	﻿What “Basic” Really Means An examination of the term “basic,” how it’s destructive, how it’s productive, how it affects popular culture, and how it can be used to degrade girls. <p>One day during my freshman year, my friends and I had a couple of hours to kill before SING! rehearsal. We took the subway to SoHo, and after 20 minutes of confused zig-zagging through the streets and arguing with both Google Maps and each other, we ran through the door of the popular store Brandy Melville only to find ourselves underwhelmed by the racks of dull, pink t-shirts. We spent about 10 seconds inside, and left shaking our heads and complaining about how basic every clothing item we’d seen was. By “basic,” of course, we meant bland, boring, unoriginal. We also meant mainstream and popular.</p><p>It’s a simple as this—“basic” is an insult intended to shame people for their likes and interests. It’s an accusation that we use to scare and mold each other into someone who we deem acceptable. It’s as if one day, all anyone wanted was to follow current trends and imitate celebrities, and the next, we were living in fear of anything that could prompt our friends and peers to call us basic.</p><p>Maybe it’s time to stop.</p><p>“Basic” is typically used to describe specific elements of arts and culture: restaurants, coffee shops, clothing brands and items, music, movies and television shows, hairstyles, and makeup. But it’s also used as an insult to describe people who like those things.</p><p>It’s easy to ignore the dangerous connotations of the term “basic,” because in most cases, we don’t sound malicious when we use it, but people, especially teenagers, use the term “basic” to pressure and alter each other. We’ve all done it: Retaken a selfie, avoided a brand of makeup, or walked out of a clothing store from an internalized fear of being basic.</p><p>At least, that’s what it’s like if you’re a girl. Basic is typically directed towards conventional feminine clothing and behavior and is often used by girls as a mean accusation to invalidate their female peers. Labelling makeup, popular feminine clothing, and other girl-oriented culture “basic” fuels the old stereotypes that girls are simple, all alike, and not to be taken seriously. So the label has more destructive potential than one might realize without giving it real consideration.</p><p>We all have the power to shape one another. Forcing the “basic” label on each other, targeting girls for having mainstream feminine interests, and using popular culture to shame our peers isn’t the best way to do that. Instead, we should guide each other toward a mix of mainstream and individual interests that complete our identities and help us build confidence, and if that means letting your friends make “basic” choices, let them.</p>	Article	15	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
836	﻿Entertainment is Good but Hollywood’s Rape Culture Isn’t In the highly-pressurized environment of Hollywood, rape culture continues to exist and little is being done about it. <p>Hollywood’s rape culture is deplorable, and yet, it continues to exist. One of the main sources of the problem is Hollywood’s power complex. Many of the people seeking to break into the industry find themselves at the whims of others with more power in the business. Actress Gwyneth Paltrow, now a household name, had praised Harvey Weinstein in her first Academy Award acceptance speech in 1999, but now condemns him for his sexually abusive acts. After her first distasteful confrontation with the former producer, Paltrow said she kept quiet out of concern that she would lose her starring role in “Emma” (1996), and over the years, she had tried to ignore Weinstein’s alternating kind and bullying personality.</p><p>Within Hollywood’s atmosphere, monetary pressure and an unstable career can silence those who suffer. An investigation by The New York Times found that Weinstein has been paying off accusers for at least two decades in the three that he’s been known to have committed sex crimes.</p><p>One of the better known cases of this is with actress turned activist Rose McGowan, who had been assaulted by Weinstein at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. After McGowan made hints about making her allegations public, Weinstein’s close associate reached out to her with an offer of $1 million in exchange for signing a nondisclosure statement. With money and high esteem, Weinstein could easily boost careers and often did so after forcing aspiring young women to unwillingly succumb to his sexual acts.</p><p>The co-founder of the Weinstein Company isn’t the only sex offender who has been able to get away from the attention of the public eye for so long. In another recent series of allegations, “House of Cards”  star Kevin Spacey was accused of trying to seduce actor Anthony Rapp when Rapp was only 14 years old. Since then, at least a dozen others have joined Rapp in accusing Spacey, including former Boston TV news anchor Heather Unruh, who spoke of Spacey getting her son drunk before proceeding to grab the then 18-year-old’s genitals. In a Twitter response to the allegations against him, Spacey admitted to having sexually assaulted Rapp and came out as gay soon after.</p><p>Media outlets blew up, but rather than focusing on Spacey’s admission of sexual assault, they focused almost exclusively on the actor’s coming-out. Only when the public criticized the lack of attention on Spacey’s illegal actions did the media stop covering up the accusations. The media follows Hollywood’s lead and tries to make revenue through enticing topics like sexual orientation rather than heavy ones like sexual abuse. Comedian Cameron Esposito says it best in her reaction to Spacey’s tweet, “Being gay has nothing to do w[ith] going after underage folks.”</p><p>The media’s reluctance to address the real problems is a common issue. When an unpleasant subject matter is being covered, news sources will often still downplay the magnitude of the situation, as with the news coverage of Spacey’s tweets.</p><p>Though Hollywood promotes liberal messages, its rape culture is still prevalent. The scandals and sexual crimes that continue to pop up in the news are directly correlated to Hollywood’s biased nature and inability to confront its own problems.</p><p>The quietness of victims further enables sexual harassment. Of the more than 80-something women who have spoken out against Weinstein, only a handful have chosen to relay more information either themselves or through representatives. However, actress Scarlett Johansson defends those who are silent, saying, “It’s irresponsible to take a bunch of actors [...] and throw their name into a situation they couldn’t possibly comment on.” The people who refuse to or cannot speak are not to blame. Those who choose to take action can be putting their careers in jeopardy or may even face the failure of not being heard.</p><p>What may be contributing to victims’ inaction is the inaction of the community around them. Commenting on the rumors about Weinstein raping McGowan, actor Alec Baldwin said to Entertainment Weekly, “It was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.”</p><p>At times in his interview, Baldwin certainly sounded like the man he impersonates on “Saturday Night Live.” Though he extended his sympathies, Baldwin made himself complicit by victim blaming. It almost seemed as if Baldwin was trying to provide cover for the assaulters, or had tried to remain neutral for the sake of reputation.</p><p>In his interview, Baldwin implied that he wouldn’t want to risk his job just to help someone in need, and in a later tweet, he called the sexual assaults a matter of gender inequality. Despite his words of empowerment, Baldwin’s excuses for his inaction completely revoke his sympathetic gestures. These types of excuses are rampant in Hollywood circles and make many unknowing bystanders.</p><p>Hollywood’s efforts to be liberal are inconsistent since many of its actions directly counteract feminist messages. Few harassers are punished severely, and accusers often aren’t taken seriously or even believed. It’s increasingly problematic when also considering that actresses get asked questions about sexual assault more often than actors, including those who have responded to allegations. This proves the public’s difficulty focusing on the bigger picture: that both men and women are victims of sexual harassment and have the responsibility to act accordingly toward our problematic rape culture.</p><p>Each new allegation that arises doesn’t badly affect the industry, which is churning out more movies than ever. This year has had quite the movie lineup, with films such as the long-awaited revival of “It” (2017) and the recent releases “Thor: Ragnarok” (2017) and “Justice League” (2017).</p><p>Hollywood has set the standards for filmmaking and is revered around the world. However, in the social sphere, it needs to start taking initiative, even if that means having its best people marginalized. Many of Hollywood’s celebrities have been outed for their crimes, but have faced minor consequences and continue to do well in their professions. People need to get past the facade that actors and studio-goers put up and start prosecuting these criminals for hurting countless women and men. Like it does for its films, the American movie industry must also set the standards for how it treats sexual assailants.</p>	Article	234	2017-11-30 09:51:55.160041	2017-11-30 09:51:55.160041
837	﻿“Going Grey” Pales in Comparison The Front Bottoms’ sixth album, “Going Grey,” swaps out Sella’s raw, idiosyncratic voice and plucky acoustic guitar for vocal maturity and experimentation with a new, electronic sound. <p>I remember sitting on my bed in 2014, listening to The Front Bottoms’s “Talon of the Hawk,” thinking to my angsty, seventh-grade self that it was one of the best albums ever made. The heaviness of the lyrics, juxtaposed with the upbeat, almost cheerful sound of lead singer Brian Sella’s gritty vocals, was definitely something new to me. Over the years, The Front Bottoms has created a name for itself through exactly that—Sella’s unique voice and plucky acoustic guitar.</p><p>However, these characteristics of the band’s early music are, for the most part, missing from their sixth album, released October 13, 2017. “Going Grey” is the culmination of The Front Bottoms’s 10 years on the music scene, and as the title suggests, Sella and drummer Mathew Uychich are growing up; their hair is turning grey.</p><p>It is their cleanest and most vocally mature album, but at the expense of its original, unique sound. Gone is much of Sella’s boyish, high-pitched voice that many fans were initially attracted to because it was something different from other alternative bands. Instead, the album features more grounded, lower-pitched vocals that no longer distinguish the band from any other band on Spotify’s Indie Rock playlist.</p><p>Tracks like “Trampoline” take the biggest step away from the band’s original sound, integrating synthesizers into the melody. The chorus is almost Daft Punk-esque, but not nearly as well done. Rather, it sounds like two little boys experimenting with electronic music, neither of whom fully know what he is doing. Too often, the work of Auto-Tune is clearly heard, especially on the dragged-out notes of “Grand Finale” and “Far Drive.” Sella’s voice feels restricted as a result of this sonic tweaking, ultimately taking away from these emotion-heavy tracks. In short, the sound is less raw emotion and more toying with electronic pop.</p><p>Content-wise, the songs on “Going Grey” are extremely similar to those of previous works, with focuses on the cyclic joys and woes of relationships, nostalgia, and deep and inconsolable sadness. But none of the lyrics in the 11 songs featured on the album are particularly profound or thought-provoking. From “A temple of daddy” in “Don’t Fill Up On Chips” to “Sometimes when we’re together/We’re not together” in “Trampoline,” the lyrics are not inspiring in any way. Sella is capable of penning meaningful words, as exemplified in the line from the band’s 2013 hit “Twin Size Mattress,” “This is for the lake that me and my friends swim in.../And it should've felt good but I could hear the Jaws theme song on repeat in the back of my mind.” The change in lyrical complexity begs the question: how did we get from there to here?</p><p>However, there are still little nuggets of gold in the album, such as “Bae,” which is not as cringey and terrible as the title suggests. The Front Bottoms flips the idea of a “bae” on its head, instead putting forth the concept that the best relationships are not necessarily the most glamorous. The song is immediately catchy, opening with Uychich’s steady, thumping drum beat. The thrumming guitar in the chorus compels the listener to sing, “I gotta move my car, I gotta move your couch/I learned that love tastes good, you shoved it in my mouth,” with Sella.</p><p>Another noteworthy song is “Raining,” the track most closely resembling their old music, as Sella swaps his newfound mature voice for the raw, imperfect voice that rocketed the New Jersey band to fame in the obscure alternative world. In true Front Bottoms fashion, the exuberant guitar beat and Sella’s cheery crooning of, “How do you think that felt for me” creates a sharp contrast with the gravitas of the subject matter: being released from the hospital but still feeling “all torn up.”</p><p>Sella’s desire for sonic development is certainly admirable, and “Going Grey” is not a total leap to another genre of music. While there are tracks that experiment with new sound, others are reminiscent of the band’s original music. However, for the casual listener who has not listened to the band’s previous albums, what “Going Grey” lacks most is organization. It’s more of a jumbled mess than a coherent, deliberately crafted album. There is no real theme recurring throughout the album, linking the songs together. There is no unity in the album; songs are strung together simply so that there is an order to them rather than to make a statement.</p><p>The Front Bottoms’ sixth album is not unenjoyable, but it doesn’t dazzle. It isn’t as inspiring and heart-wrenching as “Talon of the Hawk,” but it is a commendable attempt at a new direction for the band.</p>	Article	235	2017-11-30 09:52:58.840779	2017-11-30 09:52:58.840779
839	﻿Trump Proposes Ban on Logic  <p>After barricading the Oval Office before special counsel Robert Mueller could pummel through its doors, President Trump furiously penned an executive order calling for an immediate ban to all forms of logical reasoning, habits the press release called “destructive of the moral fabric of patriotic Americans.”</p><p>“The lying LIB MEDIA needs to stop gloating over my senseless emotions,” Trump said. “My tweets make perfect nonsense, like my speeches, but they’re beautiful, like the deal I negotiated with Mexico for the wall, which is going to be so BIG and STRONG. The approval numbers are so high—37 percent, I think it is—which just crushes Obama’s 21 percent approval rating here in West Virginia, where the real America is and the limousine liberals near 57th St and 5th Ave in Manhattan are not.”</p><p>The leader of the free world also mentioned that he would not hesitate to completely obliterate any organization or locale that sanctions critical thinking, particularly any that continues to manipulate his statements by implying that they have any relevance to real events that occur on the spinning blue globe we all inhabit.</p><p>With regard to the Mueller investigation, Trump adds that he will most likely be proven innocent and be freed from all charges if everyone would just stop thinking so damn hard.</p>	Article	237	2017-11-30 09:57:01.500871	2017-11-30 09:57:01.500871

On one particular day, however, a flyer was seen making its way across the entire span of the bridge. In fact, this freshman entered the school with a whopping two flyers. Sarah Wong, the perpetrator, commented, “I really liked the agenda that they proposed. I picked up two to give one to my friend to see.”</p><p>What Sarah did not realize was that she had picked up flyers from two different campaigns. Both listed “working with the administration on science frees,” “the ability to enter school at 7:00 a.m.,” “more freshman electives and AP classes,” and “freshman class spirit.” The differences between their agendas were as minute as second-term seniors’ homework.</p><p>The amount of effort poured into campaign advertising this year reached record heights. The Schneider-Corr campaign team was seen hang gliding with their banner off of the seven to nine escalator. Four freshmen reported to the nurse’s office with nervous tics described as “a forceful jerk of the arm as if they were offering something to someone.”</p><p>In their victory, the Schneider-Corr campaign promises to completely revolutionize the role of the Freshman Caucus. They look forward to petitioning the administration for science frees and to being rebuked for the 12th straight year.</p>	Article	239	2017-11-30 09:58:02.192482	2017-11-30 09:58:02.192482
842	﻿Pinheads Finish Proud Stuyvesant’s girls’ bowling team was defeated by Telecomm in the third round of the playoffs, but was otherwise proud of their overall performance this season. <p>After defeating Richmond Hill High School in the second round of the playoffs, Stuyvesant’s girls’ bowling team, the Pinheads, faced off against the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology (Telecomm). However, the game got off to a rough start for the Pinheads. “We called a timeout after the sixth frame. There wasn’t much time left in the game and both our A and B teams were down by a lot of pins. At that point, it was time for us to stop worrying about the other team and just do the best we [could],” senior and co-captain Sonal Parab said.</p><p>Her attitude re-energized the team, but it was too little too late for a comeback. Despite demolishing their opponent in game C with a score of 502-378, games A and B both ended in defeats for the Pinheads, effectively ending their season.</p><p>“The thought of losing was already looming over our heads and the tension was palpable,” senior and co-captain Emily Lee said. “One of our flaws was probably underestimating our opponents.” During the first two games, each Telecomm player bowled in triple digits and never allowed the Pinheads to climb back into the game. Parab did her best to bring her team back by bowling a 142 in game A and 150 in game C, but the team as a whole was unable to keep pace with Telecomm, losing game A with a score of 586-458 and game B with a score of 435-406.</p><p>Despite the difficult loss, the Pinheads had a largely successful season. The team finished their regular season with a 12-0 record in the Manhattan II division and entered the playoffs as the seventh seed (out of 40). They also had many impressive individual accomplishments, with Parab, senior Valerie Ng, and Lee finishing second through fourth in average pins per game in their division, with 148.36, 139.71, and 131.07, respectively.</p><p>One of the main reasons for the team’s regular season success was its chemistry and ability to remain upbeat. “My players constantly communicate with each other in practices and games and listen to one another to improve their skills. They offer each other support,” Coach Manuel Simon said. “We will always have each other’s backs,” Lee said. Daily practices and months worth of events created close-knit bonds that continue to the end of the season.</p><p>Next year will be a trying one for the Pinheads, since the team is losing five key seniors, all of whom averaged more than 117 pins per game and collectively made up three-quarters of the game A quartet and game C’s entire team in the Telecomm match. Furthermore, their unquantifiable leadership will especially be missed. “I also have great and efficient captains in Sonal Parab, Emily Lee, and Valerie Ng, who have exemplified great leadership skills since the beginning of the season,” Simon said. Junior Sylvia Li will be one of the players expected to take a larger role on the team, already bowling with the game A team this year and dominating to the tune of 121.5 pins per game, despite some playoff struggles (86.67 pins per game).</p><p>Though the Pinheads’ season ended a game or two before they would have liked, they kept their heads up in the end. “After the game, it was clear that the team had fun. Even though we lost, there were smiles all around,” Parab said. “We’ve had a good season and I’m proud to say that we were able to end off on a happy note.”</p>	Article	240	2017-11-30 10:00:41.037359	2017-11-30 10:00:41.037359
830	﻿Catalonian Secession: A Regression for Europe While Catalonia has legitimate grievances against Spain, independence would only hurt Catalonia in the long term. <spec-reference id=226></spec-reference><p>A strong national identity, a legacy of separation, and perceived economic unfairness were all factors when United Kingdom voters decided to leave the European Union in what is now known as Brexit. Great Britain is now set to leave the EU behind, along with its free trade and migration, for an uncertain economic future.</p><p>Catalonia, a province of Spain, is charting the same path. In a recent referendum held by the Catalonian government, voters chose independence, and the regional government declared its secession from Spain. While the Spanish government effectively crushed independence in the short term, temporarily revoking the province’s autonomy and arresting secessionist officials, the drive for independence is unlikely to be quelled for long. However, Catalonian independence would only hurt both Catalonia, Spain, and Europe.</p><p>First and foremost, Catalonia would probably be denied membership in the European Union. Accession would require the approval of all 28 member states, which is unlikely considering that all EU member states support the Spanish central government against Catalonia. Because two-thirds of Catalonia’s exports go to the EU (and one third go to Spain itself), EU membership should be a huge factor in the Catalan people’s decision to secede. The European Single Market provides Catalonia with access to 500 million consumers, but if Catalonia were independent, nations could impose high tariffs and other trade barriers on Catalan goods.</p><p>There are many other factors to consider, such as how the debt situation with Spain would be handled. Spain currently has a massive debt load, and it’s unclear whether Catalonia would have to assume some of that burden in an independence deal. There’s also the question of whether Catalonia would create its own currency or continue using the Euro. In the face of these uncertainties, multinational companies have already begun to relocate their head offices outside of Catalonia.</p><p>The now-deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, has refused to recognize the difficulties and complexities that independence would bring, drawing a striking similarity to the rhetoric of populist politicians elsewhere in Europe, such as Nigel Farage.</p><p>The most decisive argument against independence for Catalonia is that most Catalans don’t actually support independence. While the latest referendum had a 90 percent vote for secession, it was conducted illegally, and the Spanish government urged “no” voters not to vote, resulting in a turnout of only 42 percent. In fact, prior to the beginning of the crisis, only 35 percent of Catalans supported full independence. Hundreds of thousands of protesters turned out in a pro-Spain rally on October 29; many of them were angry with the course of action the local Catalan government, the Generalitat, had taken. In fact, the Washington Post finds that around three-quarters of Catalans culturally identify with Spain, as well as Catalonia.</p><p>Catalonia’s role as a citizen within the European community also needs to be considered. Over the last two decades, the majority of Europe has come together in the belief that an international community of European countries would bring economic prosperity and maintain peace. That stability, however, relies on its 28 member states staying unified internally, both in their national and European identities.</p><p>However, this solidarity has shown major cracks. According to Pew Research, 51 percent of people within the European Union want their own countries in control of future trade deals, not the EU, and 53 percent want their own country to hold a referendum on continued membership. The most dramatic result of these pressures thus far was Brexit, reflecting the rising nationalism in Europe, with citizens increasingly wanting political and economic control to return to their own countries.</p><p>Catalonian independence isn’t an immediate rejection of the EU, but of Spain. However, the independence movement is inherently nationalistic, with supporters viewing themselves as Catalan, not Spanish. The success of this movement would send the message that the nation is the most important political unit in Europe. At a time when Europe faces crises such as a weak economy, uncertainty of U.S. commitment to European security, and the challenge of dealing with refugees, EU leadership provides solutions: improve the economy through the single market, centralize European militaries to fill a void left by the United States, and divide up the responsibility of handling refugees. Catalan independence would harm Catalonia, Spain, and Europe by splitting them at a time when unity is required in the face of adversity.</p><p>Spain’s handling of the Catalan referendum left much to be desired, with police violently repressing voters and voting officials, but that does not make independence a more promising future than unity with Spain. Though Catalonia has had its autonomy temporarily revoked in response to the crisis, beforehand, Catalonia enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy from the central government under the Constitution drawn up in 1978. Under this arrangement, the Catalan government had broad authority in matters regarding education, commerce, justice, public safety, and culture.</p><p>The Spanish government should restore Catalonia’s privileges and make an effort to resolve differences regarding the Constitution. Additionally, the Catalan government should try to cooperate with authorities in Madrid. There is no perfect solution to the problems facing Spain and Catalonia, but if both sides can come to an agreement, both Spain and Catalonia will be better off.</p>	Article	228	2017-11-30 09:33:28.438649	2017-11-30 10:32:45.56356

The peaks of the crises develop around the first of the months of November, December, and January.</p><p>Notably, no senior was well enough to make it to school on November 1, 2017. Teachers first assumed that the seniors were suffering from Halloween-related maladies, but the excuse notes pouring in the next day painted an entirely different picture. Seniors were universally struck by illness; excuse notes cited “fever,” “headache,” and “just didn’t feel well.” There was even one case of a “severe stomachache.”</p><p>Fortunately enough, teachers have developed immunity to the diseases that seniors have carried. As their students recover from their motley of illnesses at home, teachers have taken the time to pile on much-deserved tests and projects.</p><p>The seniors who were well enough to return to school on November 2nd were met with missed pop quizzes, new essay assignments, and test dates. “You miss a day of school, and all of a sudden you pull five all-nighters just to catch up,” one anonymous senior lamented. “Well, guess what? I’ll just come down with a ‘severe stomachache’ next week—hopefully on a day that not too many of my classmates will pick.”</p><p>The administration has taken notice of the latest epidemic by issuing vaccination notices to seniors. In addition, they have found similar sickness outbreaks in the attendance records of previous senior classes.</p>	Article	236	2017-11-30 09:56:38.967068	2017-11-30 09:56:38.967068
840	﻿Administration Introduces New Ban on Iconic Stuyvesant Lingo  <p>“How did you do on that test? There better be a curve.” “I’m so tired! I got like two hours of sleep last night studying for this APUSH test; I feel dead.” “I think I copped a 50.”</p><p>The constant barrage of complaints in the hallways has led the administration to enact a school-wide ban on certain conversations. These include:</p><p><ul><li>Any discussion of grades, tests, colleges, or impending deadlines</li><li>Complaints about homework or projects</li><li>Complaints regarding sleep</li><li>The word <del>“coffee”</del></li></ul></p><p>Following the ban, an eerie silence has descended upon Stuyvesant.

Friends that once considered themselves inseparable have stopped talking altogether.</p><p>Teachers were overjoyed by the administration’s decision. Chemistry teacher Gabriel Ting said, “My inbox is, for the first time in years, completely empty! No more demands about every infinitesimal grade calculation! No more questions about the numerical equivalent of a B+, and whether that can be curved to a 97!”</p><p>An anonymous teacher commented, “I haven’t talked to my colleagues in a while since I no longer complain about my annoying and needy kids.”</p><p>The ban looks to clamp down especially hard on whiny overachievers. Students with 95-plus averages face crueler punishments for claiming to be “unprepared” or “so screwed” for tests that they will definitely get at least a 95 on. Such punishments include changing their grade to an actual failing grade.</p><p>One anonymous overachieving student claimed, “Just because I’ve been preparing for this physics test rigorously for the past two weeks doesn’t mean I can’t act concerned when test day rolls around! I need to project my superiority complex onto others somehow!”</p><p>The ban was effective for three entire days, until Thursday rolled around, and students could no longer refrain from commenting on the injustice of the latest pre-calc test. With an absolute disregard for the ban, juniors huddled in the fourth floor bathrooms desperately moaning about how question 13 was never talked about in class.</p><p>Unfortunately, Stuyvesant’s security team discovered them after forcing 23 students off the benches. The juniors were forced to sacrifice a week of lunch periods, excluded from the library, and forced to socialize rather than be productive as they watched their teachers assign project after project over the weekend.</p><p>However, recent subversions have rendered the ban unworkable. Much of the school has learned Morse code, using it to communicate with pen clicks during class—annoying teachers to the brink of insanity. The foreign language department has developed a brand new language: Eway Atehay Choolsay. The administration is considering a revamp of the ban by instructing teachers to write letters of recommendation in Morse code or Eway Atehay Choolsay.</p>	Article	238	2017-11-30 09:57:38.914239	2017-11-30 09:57:38.914239
846	﻿Spartans Bid Farewell to A Successful Season The Spartans experienced ups and downs in their undefeated season, and lost in the 2nd round of the playoffs to Fort Hamilton High School. <p>The Spartans, Stuyvesant’s boys’ bowling team, went into the season with high expectations. They lived up to them during the regular season, sweeping all 12 of their division games and making it to the playoffs as a 19th overall seed by PSAL, the highest they have ever been.</p><p>The Spartans have constantly risen higher in the ranks, going further into the playoffs compared to previous years. Last year, they were ranked 31st, but lost to Tottenville High School from Staten Island. This year, they had an easier path to the playoffs with their 19th seed. However, they got a bye in the first round of the playoffs. Ultimately, the Spartans’ season culminated in a do-or-die game against Fort Hamilton High School during the second round of the playoffs on November 8, 2017.</p><p>From the get-go, the Spartans were thrown off by the lane conditions. The A team players, many of whom have big hook shots, found their hooks difficult to control; the ball  curved too early and did not hit the pocket because there was not enough grease applied to the lane before the game.The A team lost 539-586.</p><p>However, the B team helped the Spartans bounce back, winning 549-519. Junior LinPeng Chen and senior Jihui Xue led the effort, bowling 145 and 158, respectively. Since their styles are more conventional (straighter throws), they were less affected by the lane conditions. It all came down to the C team, in which Coach Di Wu stacked his four seniors. “It was already pre-determined. We were going to go down with our senior players,” Wu said. Fort Hamilton got an early lead, as their first two players bested senior and co-captain James Lee and Xue. “I wasn't used to the lane when we played the C game. I did badly during the first five frames and just got discouraged,” Xue said.</p><p>Fort Hamilton’s Sebastian Bekkaoui then bowled an incredible 203, greatly extending their lead . Though put in a tough spot, senior Wesley Chen delivered and came extremely close to match with a 191. Senior Yong Fei Zheng then won his match, but unfortunately, his score was not high enough to boost the Spartans for the win. In a suspenseful nail-biter, the Spartans lost 594-626.</p><p>“Losing in the second round was quite the tragedy,” Lee said. The C team made a true comeback possible, but came short by 32 pins. As a coach, Wu was very proud to see his team really get into the game and battle to the very end. The players kept their mentalities strong and were able to adjust to the lane conditions. Wesley Chen, for example, switched from his custom ball to the bowling alley’s plastic one and tweaked the style on his hook. As a result, he bowled a 191 in the C game compared to his 139 in the A game.</p><p>Leading up to the playoffs, the Spartans’ season had been filled with ups and downs. They faced the High School of Art and Design on October 12, 2017. Though the A and B teams won their respective matches and clinched the game (best of three), they won with relatively low pin count totals. Neither the A nor B team broke a 500 total, bowling a 473 and 439, respectively. The Spartans demolished Beacon High School on October 17, 2017; Lee led things off by bowling a 175, and the rest of the A team followed. They won by an impressive total of 601-459, and the B team delivered as well, winning 501 - 390.</p><p>However, the Spartans took a dip during a two-game series against the High School of Fashion Industries on October 18 and 19, 2017. A team with many inexperienced players, Fashion Industries did not provide much competition for the Spartans; no player bowled above 100 in either game. The Spartans won, but the majority of the players bowled in the low 100’s, resulting in totals in the low 500’s rather than their usual mid/high 500 totals in the absence of contest. The Spartans’ pin count took a hit and slid in the rankings as a result. “They kind of blur it out when there is no competition. They get stronger when their opponents are stronger,” Wu said. This was a primary example of the Spartans bowling below their full capability despite winning every game. Another difficulty for the Spartans was their composure, which further affected their performances. “Their [players’] mental games got the best of them; my captains hit a wall and lost their confidence,” Wu said. “[When] many players miss a throw or leave a pin, their immediate reaction often carries through to their following throw.”</p><p>As a coach, it was been crucial for Wu to keep his team both focused and relaxed during game situations. No matter how much the team struggled, the Spartans were always on the same page regarding their playoff aspirations. However, these expectations set by themselves and Wu have added pressure, affecting their play. “It's been a tougher-than-expected road,” Wu said. “Our team’s biggest issue was that we were inconsistent.”</p><p>Despite the inconsistencies and the early playoff exit, the Spartans still have a lot to look forward to for next year. Over the winter off-season, they will continue to stay sharp during their weekly practices at Whitestone Lanes in Queens. While bowling, the same emphasis will be placed on players closing their frames by picking up spares despite the number of pins left after the first throw. Wu will also work to make his players’ hooks more controllable so that they can make in-game adjustments and not get thrown off. While the Spartans have yet to build a solid B team with their newer players, they will definitely have a competitive core group for their A team to replace this year’s seniors. Junior LinPeng Chen, sophomore Samuel Fang, and freshman Eric (Jin Won) Kim will carry the torch.</p><p>Wu will say goodbye to the players he has brought up in his four-year coaching career. Xue, Lee, and Zheng have shown heart and dedication to their sport, inspired their teammates, and led the Spartans farther and farther each year. The Spartans have brought a new element to bowling; the captains have become passionate about their game, approaching it with a new level of seriousness and not just as a recreational sport. Their influence and motivation will hopefully continue to guide the Spartans into next year.</p>	Article	244	2017-11-30 10:01:13.076713	2017-11-30 10:01:13.076713
847	﻿Penguins Capture PSAL Championship After another undefeated regular season filled with new challenges, the Penguins capture a PSAL championship over their main rivals Brooklyn Technical High School. <p>Freshman Stella Oh dives off her starting block, being the last swimmer in her 200-yard freestyle medley group. The competitors before her have given her a slight lead, and she is halfway across the 25-yard long pool when the last swimmer from the Brooklyn Technical High School medley group springs into the water. Oh darts through the water and maintains her lead over the rival swimmer for 150 yards. On the last lap, Oh begins to slow down and the opposing swimmer hastens her pace. However, Oh out-touches the opposing swimmer by less than 0.4 seconds, giving Stuyvesant’s girls’ swimming team, the Penguins, a huge boost of six points to their total score. The Penguins ultimately triumph over the Brooklyn Technical High School Engineers by a significant margin of 59-42 in the championship meet.</p><p>The Penguins were once again dominant in the Bronx/Manhattan League, finishing the regular season as the top team in the league with a 10-0 record. Additionally, they enjoyed victories against rivals such as Hunter College High School and Bronx Science High School by large margins of 58-41 and 63-39, respectively.</p><p>The team had a new coach this year: physical education teacher Silvana Choy taking over the role of former head coach Peter Bologna as a result of his new position as Athletic Director.</p><p>The Penguins truly believe that Coach Choy has been excellent and has played a major part in their success. “[Coach Choy] definitely benefitted the team a lot by making every practice truly count and was even willing to come in on Saturdays just so that we could get a few more practices in [...] The season has been really great with her, and while I'm sure that the returning girls miss Coach Bologna, we've all opened up to Coach Choy and she's truly become part of the team,” senior and co-captain Luola Chen said.</p><p>Choy was quickly accepted by the swimmers and led the team to yet another undefeated regular season and championship. She attributes much of her success to how the captains helped her transition into her role as coach by instilling discipline into the younger swimmers and making sure they improve with every opportunity. “They organize drylands and lead lanes in practice on a daily basis [and] are solid leaders,” Choy said.</p><p>The other major obstacle the Penguins faced was the fact that there were only five seniors on the team. The results have been quite different, however, with many of the underclassmen on the team emerging as the Penguins’ top swimmers. Sophomore Emma Lee, who was voted MVP of the team as a freshman, played a crucial part in the team’s success. Lee finished first in every race she competed in this year, often lapping opponents. In the championship meet against Brooklyn Technical High School on Tuesday, November 7, Lee performed exceptionally well, finishing first in every event she participated in. This included two individual events (the 50 and 100-yard freestyle) as well as the 200-yard freestyle medley where she had the fastest time in her group. Another rising star was sophomore Arielle Aney who took home first or second place in every event she swam in this year. Aney also performed outstandingly against Brooklyn Technical High School, finishing first in the 200-yard freestyle and having the fastest time in her 400-yard freestyle medley group.</p><p>With many dominant underclassmen swimmers on the team, the Penguins once again had their eyes set on a championship run. Last year, the Penguins advanced to the championship round with a strong victory over Townsend Harris but fell short against Brooklyn Technical High School in the final meet. This year, they once again had a strong showing against Townsend Harris, winning 58-42, and got payback for last year’s loss with a decisive victory over Brooklyn Tech. “It felt great getting such a huge victory over [Brooklyn Technical High School]. We were coming off of an undefeated season last year, so the loss in the championship was really devastating to us. The way we bounced back this year, with a new coach and everything, was amazing, and I have no doubt that we’re capable of another championship next year as well,” junior Sasha Spajic said.</p><p>This need for retribution against Brooklyn Technical High School almost seemed to drive the Penguins to have such dominant performances throughout the year and ultimately capture the title.</p><p>With a returning core of outstanding swimmers as well as an effective coach, there is little reason to believe that the Penguins aren’t capable of defending their championship.“My goals for the team are for the girls to improve their stroke technique and their times. It's not about the results, it's about the process. If we continue to improve, the results will take care of themselves,” Coach Choy said.</p>	Article	245	2017-11-30 10:01:20.284364	2017-11-30 10:01:20.284364
910	﻿Health Class Reaches Record Popularity Health class reaches record popularity at Stuyvesant, as revealed through a survey, and it’s because of health teacher Ms. Garber. <p>In a recent survey conducted by The Spectator, health class was voted to be students’ favorite class with an outstanding vote of 98.9 percent, a huge increase from the 12.2 percent of the year before.</p><p>Assistant Principal of Health and Physical Education Brian Moran was excited to see these results. “I am proud of our school’s top-notch health education. I always believed students would find this class very fulfilling and entertaining, as it pertains to reality and brings a touch of delight to their dull cellphone-less lives,” he said.</p><p>The results of the survey were attributed to Health teacher Barbara Garber and her intellectually stimulating baby project, which requires her students to carry around a baby doll. “I let my kids get creative with the babies’ names,” Barber said. “But instead of names of drugs like ‘Marijuana,’ which I thought they would choose, I get sweet names like ‘Mary’ and ‘Jane.’Stuyvesant students are such sweet angels.”</p><p>Students have been so attached to this project that many have continued carrying their babies around even after the project was over, calling on administration to install baby playpens in every classroom. “My baby needs a place to be! I couldn’t possibly leave it on the cold hard surface of my desk. What if it falls down and has a concussion?” junior Joseph Lee said.</p><p>Due to popular request, administration has been considering adding a health elective or making health a two-semester course led by Garber, going into details about quadruplet caretaking techniques and advanced hands-free male breastfeeding techniques. “I can’t imagine not having health in my schedule. It’s basically the only reason I come to school now! If I can’t take this class anymore, I think I’m just gonna stay home to take care of my baby,” junior Peter Jin said.</p><p>Garber is also excited about what these changes to the health department could mean. “I no longer need to preach abstinence, since everyone knows how to care for a baby anyway,” she said.</p>	Article	308	2017-12-21 22:37:06.269645	2017-12-21 22:37:06.269645
911	﻿Communist Revolution Inspires Hostile Takeover of Stuyvesant A Stuyvesant sophomore decides to start a revolution and overthrows the entire school’s administration. <p>With five essays, a project explaining why people who don’t study French can’t pronounce the word “croissant” properly, and a reading of the “The Communist Manifesto” due on the same day, sophomore Steve Wang finally reached his breaking point. After intense hours of thinking to no fruition, he finally picked up his copy of the “The Communist Manifesto.”</p><p>But once Wang picked it up, it was love at first sight. He even taught himself German to read Marx’s original. He was ready to start a new revolution.</p><p>The following day, Wang gathered as many people as he could to his locker and gave one of the greatest speeches in recorded history.</p><p>“I was in tears,” recalled sophomore Javed Jokhai with tears streaming down his eyes. “He was so passionate throughout the entire thing. His speech rapidly reached a pinnacle:</p><p>“‘The gentle laborer shall no longer suffer from the noxious greed of the teachers! We will dismantle oppression board by board! We'll saw the foundation of the administration in half, even if it takes an eternity! With your support, we will send the hammer of the students’ will crashing through the windows of this house of servitude! Let the faculty tremble at a student revolution. The pupils have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors of all GPAs unite!’”</p><p>“It’s not even like he shamelessly plagiarized a Squidward speech and ‘The Communist Manifesto’—it was based off of pure originality,” he said.</p><p>Soon after the speech was given, Wang and his followers took to the halls, armed with sharpened pencils and notebooks and toting a giant banner that boldly read, “Seize the Means of Education” in red lettering.</p><p>Eventually, students from all classes started to join in his march. As more teachers were stripped of their titles, students reportedly started to discard their textbooks outside of classroom windows, replacing them with more copies of “The Communist Manifesto” while Wang dictated the following speech:</p><p>“No longer will we be dictated by the teachings of our former masters! We have been oppressed by our teachers—students have suffered for far too long under this regime where scholars keep getting curved up by the grades of the working students! But—no more shall we be exploited by this grading system. Nay, in place of the old system, with its AP classes and electives, we will have 11 free periods a day!”</p><p>After all of the faculty were overthrown, Wang decided that his work was done. Little did he know, it was a dark time when it was every person for himself or herself; without teachers, students ran amok throughout the halls. Eventually, this led to factions. One of the largest of these factions was being led by sophomore Adrian Dickson, who rallied in support of the old grading system.</p><p>Sensing the imminent threat of Dickson, Wang began to rally again. Being forced to fight against Dickson’s contacts from Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech as well, Wang and his few supporters managed to cough up a miracle; with only old stress balls and gym shorts at their disposal, they managed to win against the advancing army.</p><p>However, his victory was short-lived. After hearing the news of their son’s radical thinking, Wang’s parents immediately came to school and pulled him out by the ear, shouting threats along the way. Though resistant at first, he quickly complied to their demands after they threatened to burn his Karl Marx plush toy and proletariat action figures.</p><p>At the cost of future communist revolutions, the assigned “The Communist Manifesto” reading has since been revoked as well. To fill the void in the curriculum, teachers are now showing documentaries on communism that will surely make any revolutionary fall asleep.</p>	Article	309	2017-12-21 22:46:30.793464	2017-12-21 22:46:30.793464
912	﻿Business Update: Severe Coffee Price Increases Cause Panic  <p>Coffee prices from vendors around Stuyvesant have seen a severe increase: the average price of a 12-oz hot coffee has shot up 327 percent to $4.30 as of December 20.</p><p><b>A Global Coffee Shortage? </b></p><p>Coffee vendors are insistent that they have simply run out of coffee supplies.</p><p>“After several weeks of exhaustive coffee consumption at Stuyvesant, global coffee supply has dwindled dangerously,” Starbucks executive chairman Howard Schultz explained. “In our sources in Brazil, sub-saharan Africa, and Indonesia, discontent growers have balked at the extreme production requirements that Stuyvesant students have imposed. They know how high demand is, and now, they’re charging a premium.”</p><p>When pressed on why only the Chambers Street branch has seen such severe price increases, Schultz declined to comment. A similar response was given by other coffee vendors frequented by Stuyvesant students.</p><p>A document was recently uncovered documenting a cartel between 17 major coffee outlets around Stuyvesant. However, according to independent analyst Howie Stultz, this is likely “a mere prank from students.”</p><p><b>The Toll on Students</b></p><p>Students are the main victims.</p><p>Some students have continued purchasing coffee despite the now eye-watering costs. “My favorite frap is now $9.90, but you only live once, right?” senior Steve Wong remarked.</p><p>Thrifty students have created an app that tracks coffee prices at specific vendors. The price of coffee at different vendors has become very much volatile as a result of constantly increasing prices. Just this morning, there was a $0.45 difference between Starbucks and the coffee cart before the coffee cart updated its price at 7:43 AM.</p><p>Other students have resorted to secretly making coffee at home. These are primarily students who consume over 10 cups a day; they purchase more coffee once they reach Stuyvesant to escape their parents’ indignation. One anonymous student professed to using instant simply because it was easier to hide.</p><p>Some festive students have given up on coffee, instead consuming non-alcoholic eggnog. Regrettably, eggnog has completely failed at keeping students alert. One eggnog-crazed senior is peacefully asleep and is projected to stay asleep past the New Year.</p>	Article	310	2017-12-21 22:47:54.578837	2017-12-21 22:47:54.578837
914	﻿Goodbye Girardi, Hello Boone Aaron Boone’s hire as the next Yankees manager leaves more questions than answers about the team. <p>Aaron Boone will forever have a place in Yankees lore for his 2003 American League Championship Series (ALCS) game seven walk-off home run against the hated Boston Red Sox. That one hit propelled him to the front page of every New York newspaper and has allowed his name to live on even after his short 54-game stint with the team. Now, 15 years later, he is coming back to the Yankees in a completely different role: manager. To put it lightly, this is a questionable decision; Joe Girardi was an underrated manager who deserved his job, and Boone will have many expectations that I’m not sure he’s capable of achieving.</p><p>As a diehard Yankees fan, I’m all for making this team the best it can be. However, sometimes change is detrimental, especially after coming within one game of a World Series berth. Joe Girardi, the former manager, led this club to the ALCS against the eventual World Series champion Houston Astros and fought hard until the very end. This is the very same Yankees team that, in an ESPN article from last March, had only one out of 35 winning the division or making any noise in the postseason (they ended two games behind Boston in the division, but won the wildcard to make it to the playoffs) according to ESPN analysts; this is the team with the injury-prone pitching staff and the one with the inexperienced lineup. While Girardi cannot take all the credit for his team’s 91-71 finish—outfielder Aaron Judge and pitcher Luis Severino’s breakout are obviously products of their own efforts—Girardi was the mastermind that put the club together. He ran a tight ballclub and let the veterans lead by example for the many younger players. He put pressure on his players to execute, and they followed him. No matter if it was game one or game 162, he coached like it was the playoffs. The fire he brought carried over to the team and kept them focused throughout the season.</p><p>I’m not saying Girardi is without flaws. He elected not to replay a hit-by-pitch that actually hit the knob of the bat of Lonnie Chisenhall in the American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians. That missed call almost doomed the Yankees, as Indians’ shortstop Francisco Lindor hit a grand slam during the next at-bat to shrink the Yankees’s lead to 8-7. Furthermore, he spoke out about catcher Gary Sanchez’s defensive inabilities during the season. This is not something he should be talking to the media about, but rather working with Sanchez on behind the scenes. Going to the press is an easy way to alienate oneself from the club, something Girardi luckily avoided. However, through the controversies, he remained in power of his club and made sure his players gave it their all every game.</p><p>Aaron Boone, meanwhile, has experienced none of this. Coaches and players lead vastly different lives, and Boone has not been in a dugout since the end of his playing career in 2009. Since then, he has worked as an ESPN analyst on “Sunday Night Baseball” and other baseball events. While he has been a part of the game, he has not had any coaching experience. Other options for the position, such as Yankees bench coach Rob Thomson, have at least been in the locker room with the team and know what it takes to succeed. Boone will instead be learning on the fly on a team with much higher expectations than the ones they had entering last season. He will be tasked with continuing the “Baby Bomber” development and living up to the hype surrounding the team. Us Yankees fans believe this group of players is special, and cannot see the plan get derailed because of an incompetent coach.</p><p>For both myself and the Yankees, I hope I will be pleasantly surprised. I hope he is the manager we need that will lead the team to its next golden age after the Core Four of the late 1990s and 2000s. However, as of right now, I can’t see how he’d be an improvement over Girardi. Boone will be taking over from his role at ESPN, a position not remotely related to coaching. Girardi’s steadying influence at the helm of the Yankees over the last 10 years, meanwhile, led teams with varying degrees of talent to a combined 910-710 record, the best in the MLB in that span. He deserved another chance with this team. However, Boone is in, and I truly hope this new position only improves his legacy from the 2003 ALCS. After last season, everyone in baseball will be keeping close tabs on the budding Yankees superteam. Here’s to hoping Aaron can keep them on track for a dynasty.</p><p>[a]alliterative title is a work in progress</p>	Article	312	2017-12-21 22:49:47.625824	2017-12-21 22:49:47.625824
913	﻿Trump Challenged to IQ Test with Senior Eugene Thomas  <p>Senior Eugene Thomas was so distraught after receiving a test score in BC calculus that he challenged President Trump to an IQ test.</p><p>“You don’t understand. My 98.31415926 GPA will be permanently marred by the 96 I’m going to receive in this class,” argued Thomas. “It’s not my fault Mr. Cocoros only lets students bump their tests to a maximum of 92 with retakes.” At this point, he broke down in tears.</p><p>Thomas’s challenge was quickly spread throughout the Internet and caught the president’s attention. Trump replied via Twitter, “Yet another example of the liberal elite thinking that I’m stupid and that everyone else is beneath them. I accept your challenge, but we all know who’s going to WIN.” Thomas was slated to arrive at the White House on December 15.</p><p>In the meantime, Thomas prepared for the test. He studied old IQ tests. He memorized the cubic and quartic formulas (and their derivations), as well as the proofs for the existence of the distance and incompleteness theorems. He also made sure to memorize the entirety of all of the translations available of “War and Peace.”</p><p>The IQ test itself seemed to go as planned. Coverage aired on C-SPAN, which garnered the most viewers in the 18-49 demographic in the channel’s history. The two took to opposite sides of the Oval Office. Thomas finished in 17 minutes and 32 seconds, but patiently waited for the next hour for the president to finish.</p><p>The results, however, were not released to the public. When questioned about it on December 16, Trump yelled, “The test was rigged,” and then ranted for thirty minutes.</p><p>Later that evening, Trump tweeted, accusing Thomas of cheating. He wrote, “Obstructionist liberals are so afraid of losing and so dishonest that they insist on cheating. Sad! The American people will find out the truth!”</p><p>Shortly after, Trump tweeted again, announcing a second round: “While my wonderful staff is recounting the results of the tests, I’ve decided that we should have a second round, just for good measure. I’ve been practicing eighth dimension chess for the test anyway, so I’ll win again!”</p>	Article	311	2017-12-21 22:48:03.29449	2017-12-23 13:17:12.176172
926	﻿Phoenix Look to Carry On Tradition of Success Under the leadership of seniors Shannon Lau and Delaney Demark, and behind a growing youth movement, the Phoenix look to go deep into the playoffs. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>“We want to win, but our vision isn’t solely fixed on that one goal. We want to win the right way,” senior and co-captain Shannon Lau said. This statement indicates more than just a competitive desire; it suggests an extremely healthy team culture that carries over from success on the court to class off of it.</p><p>A strong team culture stems from a sound veteran nucleus, and the Phoenix have just that with three seniors entering their fourth season: Lau, forward and co-captain Delaney Demark, and guard Joan Ngai. The Phoenix have maintained a bountiful three-year run with these three on the team, averaging 13 wins a season and finishing first in the Manhattan A South League two of three times. In theory, with Lau and Demark serving as the team’s captains and Ngai due to have substantial minutes off the bench, this streak should not cease.</p><p>In practice, though, there are legitimate roadblocks to overcome, such as the fact that numerous contributors from last season are no longer with the team. The biggest loss is Tiffany Ng (‘17). Beyond offering solid defense at guard, Ng was also the team’s best three-point shooter by a wide margin, hitting 23 of the Phoenix’s 34 total three-point shots over the course of last season and playoffs. And, according to Lau, Ng also contributed significantly to the team’s spirit, chemistry, and dynamic. With professional basketball teams like the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets finding sustained success built around three-point shooting, such a strategy was bound to trickle down to the high school level sooner than later, so the departure of last year’s top performer in that department will have consequences.</p><p>According to Demark, though, the Phoenix have a contingency plan, stating that junior Kaitlyn Duong and Lau have both “demonstrated that they are more than capable of hitting threes,” she says. Being a captain that has spent multiple seasons around both Duong and Lau, Demark speaks from experience. However, this assertion has little statistical backing, as Lau and Duong had just two three-pointers combined last year, so they would have to make a quantum leap to completely fill the void.</p><p>Another major piece from last season who is no longer with the team is senior Tara Greene, who transferred earlier this fall. Though she was not a prolific scorer, averaging just over 3.2 points a game, she was a ferocious rebounder, finishing with 69 rebounds over the course of the regular season, putting her third on the team and second among the Phoenix’s forwards. However, there seems to be a young successor ready to step up. Ana-Maria Skaricic, the team’s backup center, is only a freshman, but she may already have the attitude and tenacity to play from the get-go. “Aggression is a really hard concept to teach, but Ana-Maria nails it on offense and defense and is getting better each day,” Lau said. If Skaricic is able to improve in the coming years, it could make for a fearsome frontcourt between her and junior and starting center Ally Archer, who will split time with Skaricic in the low post.</p><p>Looking beyond the lost contributors, however, there are also a number of facets in which the Phoenix have improved. Last season, for instance, the team was moribund at the free throw line, with just one player (Demark) shooting over 65 percent from the stripe. This was a legitimate issue, and may have actually been the factor that kept Stuyvesant out of first place last year. The Phoenix’s “missed about five free throws each game,” Lau said, so considering that three of the team’s five losses, including the 33-29 loss to eventual division champion Millennium High School, came at margins under five points, the Phoenix truly were a few missed free throws away from a 15-2 first place finish.</p><p>This year, however, free throw shooting seems to be a point of emphasis. “Each practice, we’re running sprints and taking 20-30 free throws in between to make us game-ready,” Lau said. With head coach Vincent Miller apparently altering practices to address such a glaring problem from last season, the Phoenix should fare much better, both from the line and in close games.</p><p>Another bright spot is the team’s immense depth, provided by its young talent. Freshman and small forward Isabel Leka, for instance, is another candidate to help fill the so-called “three-and-D” role left by Tiffany Ng. “Isabel has been phenomenally cutting to the basket, playing defense, and shooting outside the arc,” said Lau, indicating that Leka should have a primary bench role for the Phoenix, in the very least. Two other names to watch are sophomores Eve Wening and Selene Kaehny, as they have provided valuable minutes for the team so far at the guard and forward positions, respectively.</p><p>“Coach Miller may use more of a rotation that includes more underclassmen than in previous years,” Demark said. If this is the case, this could lead to both a more diverse playbook and greater rest time for starters.</p><p>In fact, according to Lau, this is already happening: “Miller and I have incorporated a few more offensive and defensive sets. I believe that variety is important, especially when we get deeper into the season and play against teams for the second time,” she says. This is smart, as it indicates that the team is already looking to the playoffs. While the lost star power provided by players like Ng and Greene will hurt and could once again keep the Phoenix out of first place, all of that is pedestrian compared to the postseason.</p><p>So, if this revamped game plan truly does pay off, and if the Phoenix get a spark from the potential return of junior forward Talia Kirshenbaum, last year’s leading rebounder, from a semester at the Mountain School, Stuyvesant could prosper in January when it matters most. While the Phoenix are unlikely to usurp Millennium High School’s throne, a run into and beyond the third round of the playoffs—something that the team has been unable to accomplish during each of the last three seasons—is very much within the realm of possibility.</p>	Article	324	2017-12-22 18:07:03.80389	2017-12-23 19:38:22.539966
843	﻿Greyducks Return To State Championships Going into the competition, the team knew it was going to be a bigger challenge than the Borough Championships but was driven to make it back to the State Federation meet. <p>Tired and exhausted, the Greyducks, Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity cross country team, waited nervously for their results as the race came to an end. Fresh off of winning the Borough Championships, the Greyducks looked to replicate that success in the much tougher City Championships on November 11 at Van Cortlandt Park. Going into the competition, the team knew it was going to be a bigger challenge than the Borough Championships but was driven to make it to the State Federation meet for the second year in a row. There were 198 and 154 participants in the junior varsity race and varsity race, respectively, from schools all over New York City, and all of them were ready to compete.</p><p>The top four teams in the varsity race would automatically qualify for State’s. As the results were announced, there were shouts of joy: the Greyducks had finished third, behind Brooklyn Technical High School and Susan Wagner High School, securing their spot at the State competition.</p><p>In the junior varsity race, sophomore Ester Suleymanov finished in ninth place with a time of 24:06:45. She was followed by senior Connie Lei (24:49:41) in 27th, sophomore Ling Chen (24:59:99) in 32nd, and junior Bernice Chen (25:39:18) in 49th place. Coach Rachel Beck noted that many new personal bests for the girls on the team were recorded at the City Championships.</p><p>Throughout the season, junior Clara Mohri and freshman Julianne Yotov had been leading the varsity team. This time, it was no different. Mohri finished at seventh (20:19:93) while Yotov finished seconds behind at ninth (20:24:28). They were followed by sophomore Elizabeth Reizis at 35th (22:03:97), freshman Agatha Edwards at 55th (22:52:91), junior Tiffany Zhong at 72nd (23:24:16), freshman Jessica Kwok at 90th (23:49:67), and junior Vivian Cribb at 97th (24:07:50). “We have been training very hard this season, so it’s great that all our work is paying off,” Yotov said.</p><p>“Although we suffered some injuries throughout the season, we were able to persevere and place third overall in the city,” Zhong said.</p><p>As the cross country season comes to a close, Coach Beck looks back on the season with great pride. “The lady Greyducks have had a very successful season. Both Coach [Laurie] Burke and I are extremely proud of all the girls on the team who showed up each week to run with heart and grit,” Coach Beck said. “We saw so many PR’s [personal records] over the course of the season. Our top seven girls will round out the season by heading upstate this weekend for the second year in a row to compete in the state meet! Stay tuned.”</p>	Article	241	2017-11-30 10:00:52.370199	2017-11-30 10:00:52.370199
844	﻿The True Underdog Success of The Astros Coming from some of the worst seasons in franchise history, the Astros have since developed homegrown players, culminating in this year’s World Series Victory. <p>In the bottom of the ninth inning with an empty count, Corey Seager hit a weak ground ball to second base. It was fitting that the final play of the World Series was made by none other than Jose Altuve, the American League (AL) MVP who led the Astros from an extremely disappointing season to a championship one.</p><p>Though it is tempting to see Altuve as the driving force behind this success, it is actually  because of a cultivation of five years worth of important actions. In 2013, the Astros set a franchise record for the most losses in a single season, finishing with a 51-111 record. Following that, they began to build one of the strongest and deepest teams over the past year, even without the massive budget of some of their top competitors.</p><p>Altuve wasn't the only major contributor to the team’s pennant win this year, but he was critical to the their success. Picked up as an amateur in 2007, he made his major league debut in 2011. Since then, he has turned heads for his short stature and strong play. His last two seasons have been breakout years, marking a new segment in his career. Last season, he led the league in hits and the AL in batting average, finishing in third for the AL MVP award. This year, he followed up on last years stats, topping the league in batting average and leading the AL in hits. As captain, he brings a style of play that promotes a much more relaxed and enjoyable style of baseball, rallying many fans behind the Astros this season.</p><p>The story of the Astros’ postseason success would also be incomplete without crediting George Springer. A leadoff hitter for most of the season, he was one of the Astros’ best at the plate, but didn’t reach his peak until the postseason. He hit six home runs in the postseason, three of them coming in the World Series. His power and reliability during the World Series were unprecedented, and he led the Astros with a .379 batting average and a 1.000 slugging percentage, stats strong enough to earn him the MVP for the World Series.</p><p>Springer’s success comes after three years of relatively mediocre performances since his debut in 2014. He was drafted in 2011 and was certainly not expected by the Astros to be one of their stars. Entering the MLB with a speech impediment, he spoke often about his low confidence at the beginning of his career. But he’s been able to push through his personal issues and even raise awareness. On top of this, he led the Astros to success in the World Series with numerous leadoff home runs. Both homegrown players, Springer and Altuve have developed together over the past six years and contributed heavily to the team's success.</p><p>The Astros’ homegrown talent extends beyond their hitting core. Over the past season, they have accumulated new pitchers while also transforming some of their weakers arms into stronger weapons.</p><p>One of the breakout pitchers this postseason was Charlie Morton. Prior to this year, he had been one of the weaker starters on a challenged Pittsburgh Pirates team. Not much was expected of him coming into this year; he had only one season with a winning record before. However, he defied expectations and delivered a strong 14-7 record, as well as commanding appearances in the World Series, most notably in Game 7. Dallas Keuchel, another homegrown player, was one of the strongest pitchers in the league over the course of the regular season. In the playoffs he struggled with consistency, providing some dominant performances in the ALCS and then some mediocre starts in the World Series.</p><p>But the most dominant pitcher in the entire postseason was Justin Verlander, a last-minute signing before the trade deadline. He struggled to regain his old dominance during the first part of the season. However, after he signed with the Astros, he delivered five wins on the mound without dropping a game. His performance in the postseason was even more impressive, shutting down the Dodgers, despite one loss. His signing in the fall rounded out one of the strongest pitching staffs in the AL.</p><p>This year’s success showed that an underdog team, even without a massive budget to spend, can become a champion in just a couple years. This season could blow away some teams’ notion that strict discipline is the only way to win, a principle many baseball fans have struggled with over the past few years.</p>	Article	242	2017-11-30 10:01:00.513621	2017-11-30 10:01:00.513621
845	﻿Birdies’ Undefeated Season Ends The Birdies look forward to next season with championship aspirations. <p>The Birdies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ golf team, started their semifinals match against Tottenville fiercely as senior and first starter Catherine Joh defeated her opponent in the first hole. The team hoped to build momentum from this exhilarating victory. However, Joh lost the match by a final score of four up. The remaining four starters were unable to get a rally going, bringing the Birdies’ season to an end at the hands of powerhouse Tottenville, 5-0. “Certainly, we were slightly disappointed we didn’t advance to the finals, but to even get to play against Tottenville is an achievement in and of itself,” sophomore and second starter Charlotte Yee said.</p><p>Overall, however, the Birdies have no reason to be disappointed. “It was a pretty successful season. We won our first 10 games, made it to semifinals, played very well in semifinals, but lost to Tottenville. I was pretty happy because we showed we could play,” Coach Emilio Nieves said.</p><p>The team certainly did just that, finishing the regular season on top of the Brooklyn division for the fourth season in a row with an undefeated record of 9-0. In fact, the last time the Birdies lost a match in the regular season was the 2014-15 season, in which they finished with a record of 8-1.</p><p>The Birdies, however, have not been able to advance past the semifinals in the last four years, an obstacle they hope to overcome next season. This will be a tough task for a team that is losing its first and third starters, seniors Joh and Lucy Liu after this year. “We want to field a team [next season] equally as competitive as this year’s,”  Yee said.</p><p>Two players who hope to fill those spots are junior Jessica Park and sophomore Kristie Chu. “I want to play in more matches and dedicate myself to golf more, since this is the team I’ve been on since the end of my freshman year,” Park said. Chu expressed her determination as well: “Ideally, I would want for the team to be first in the city,” she said. Chu is not alone, as the team has high hopes for next season, and an appearance in the finals is certainly not out of reach.</p><p>“We have three out of five starters, so we should still have a good team. But that just gives the subs an opportunity to step up. The harder they work to step up, the more successful we’ll be next year,”  Nieves said.</p>	Article	243	2017-11-30 10:01:05.628953	2017-11-30 10:01:05.628953
848	﻿A Valiant Effort on the Part of the Vixens  <p>For a moment, the air was still as senior and co-captain Ziqi Guo jumped for an outside hit. Guo slammed the ball down, ending the first set decisively in favor of the Vixens. Similarly, the team dominated the second set, winning 25-16.</p><p>With their first playoff game against 31st seed Bayard Rustin Educational Complex in the books after just two sets, it seemed like the Vixens were well on their way to a successful post-season, but a closer look indicated otherwise. Missed covers and receives and countless net balls riddled the game, and for a second seed team, this was beyond disappointing. Too often, a server from Bayard would cost the Vixens more than a few points before they were able to return the serve. “We definitely didn’t meet our standards for how we should have played. Instead of playing like a two seed, we stooped down to the other team’s level,” junior Alexandra Archer said.</p><p>Playing down is difficult to address because it has more to do with the mental and emotional states of the players than their physical capabilities. However, the Vixens didn’t give up and tried to soothe their nerves. “We’ve made some new cheers that help us laugh a little and move past any mistake,” Archer said. “We need to focus all the extra energy our body is giving us into the game.”</p><p>Despite their best efforts, however, the momentum the Vixens had gained during the season didn’t transfer into the playoffs. The game against Bayard foreshadowed the subsequent loss that would end the Vixens’ shot at advancing in playoffs. In a disappointing turn of events, the Vixens lost two sets to one against the 15th seed Florence LaGuardia High School Athletics in the second-round playoff game. “I don’t want them to feel like it’s their fault. I admire the effort they put into this season and into the game,” coach Vasken Choubaralian said.</p><p>The Vixens had entered the A division playoffs as an impressive second seed in a pool of 31 teams, and though they didn’t advance as far as they’d hoped, it was a season to be proud of. With the exception of a tough outing away against a formidable Seward Park Campus, the team had a successful regular season, winning every other match, including its rematch against Seward Park, most in just two sets. They finished atop the Manhattan A South/East division with an 11-1 record. Seward Park and Lab Museum United finished close behind with 10-2 and 9-3 records, respectively.</p><p>In addition to their success as a team, many of the starters were forces to be reckoned with statistically. Archer led the division with a whopping 16 blocks in the regular season, 6 more than the runner-up. Guo, senior Shirley Liu, and senior Kristina Kim also placed prominently at fifth with 57 kills, third with 85 assists, and fourth with 45 digs, respectively. As the setter and the libero of the team, Liu and Kim played integral roles in the Vixens’ scheme all season long.</p><p>However, the prospects for next season are both thrilling and worrisome: the starting lineup was comprised mainly of seniors, and the team will be losing seven in total. The Vixens will need players to step up if they want a shot at remaining at the level they currently are. “The future looks bright, but this moment sucks. The rest of the team is eager to fill up the spots, to get on the court and play, and they’re ready for it,” Choubaralian said.</p>	Article	246	2017-11-30 10:01:25.624878	2017-11-30 10:01:25.624878
849	﻿Greyducks’ Season Cut Short at City Championships The Greyducks did not qualify for the New York State Federation Meet and were disappointed in their performance, but they had a positive view of the season as a whole. <p>It was a chilly day at Van Cortlandt Park on Saturday, November 11, the day of the PSAL Cross Country City Championships. Goosebumps covered the bodies of the runners and the air they breathed turned white behind them as they ran towards the finish line. Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity cross country team, the Greyducks, fell short of qualifying for the New York State Federation Meet. The loss brought an untimely end to what had been a promising season for the Greyducks, leaving some members disappointed but others proud of their accomplishments.</p><p>Heading into the City Championships, the Greyducks were the underdogs once again, previously having been projected to lose to the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering in the Manhattan Borough Championships on Saturday, November 4. “We were expected to be ninth in the city based on our previous performances,” senior and co-captain Minhein Htet said. Only the top four teams in the City Championships qualify for the Federation Meet. In addition, the top 12 athletes not part of the four qualifying teams are eligible to run in the Federation Meet.</p><p>In the varsity five-kilometer race, sophomore Baird Johnson placed 21st with a time of 17:40.09, and senior Clive Johnston finished 29th with a time of 17:55.34. “Clive Johnston and Caleb Hoo ran tremendous races, both setting personal bests by a good margin. Baird Johnson also ran his fastest time of the season as well by about 35 seconds,” coach Carl DiSarno said. Hoo ran about 15 seconds faster than he had in the Borough Championships, and Johnston ran nearly 50 seconds faster than he had in those championships. However, these performances were not enough to qualify, as the Greyducks earned sixth place, just outside of the top four. Johnson and Johnston both qualified individually for the Federation Meet but both declined to compete for personal reasons.</p><p>Disarno’s strategy for the Greyducks was to get off to a good start and not fall behind early. “We needed to get out well and the seniors needed to run as a group,” he said. Moreover, if the seniors ran as a group, they would be able to block off runners from other teams trying to pass them. The Greyducks also needed one of the projected top four teams (Susan Wagner High School, Brooklyn Technical High School, The Bronx High School of Science, and Midwood High School) to slip up, but the team’s game plan failed as the above schools placed first, second, third, and fourth, respectively.</p><p>“We don’t have guys fast enough to beat the top guys of Midwood, but we were confident that all of our guys [could] beat their fourth man. Unfortunately, their fourth man ran exceptionally well and we were unable to make a gap big enough for us to beat Midwood. In addition, HSMSE also managed to place a few guys between our guys,” Htet said.</p><p>In the Borough Championships, Htet, Johnston, and Sit placed sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively. In the City Championships, 17 runners finished in between Johnston and Htet, and 21 runners finished in between Htet and Sit. Consequently, Stuyvesant finished behind HSMSE, who they had beaten just two weeks earlier at the Borough Championships.</p><p>In the junior varsity race, Stuyvesant placed eighth, with the final four qualifying teams being Brooklyn Technical High School, the Bronx High School of Science, the High School of American Studies, and Staten Island Technical High School, in that order.</p><p>Many Greyducks felt as if the team could have run better. “I’m not gonna mince my words. With the exception of a couple of guys who ran excellently, we all messed up big time,” Htet said. He also believed that the weather was an obstacle. “A bad race can happen to anyone and it just happened to hit some of our guys at a bad time,” he said.</p><p>Sit took a more positive approach than either Htet or Disarno to the loss. “I’m actually pretty satisfied with how the team performed. I choked up, but the rest of the team stepped up big. We mostly hit the times that we planned, but the rest of the competition also did much better,” he said.</p><p>Seniors Htet and Sit reflected on their final cross country season with the Greyducks. “I had fun this year. I have no regrets about joining this team. This sport and this team have become part of who I am. It’s sad to think about how I’m going to have to leave soon,” Htet said.</p><p>“It’s a shame that the season's over so quickly, but I know that every member was committed to the team from start to finish. Whether it was raining or freezing, they went to practice,” Sit said.</p>	Article	247	2017-11-30 10:01:35.122046	2017-11-30 10:01:35.122046
924	﻿Stuyvesant Hosts Local Hack Day Stuyvesant hosted a StuyHacks Local Hack Day on Saturday, December 2, where middle and high school students from around New York collaborated on various innovative coding projects <p>StuyHacks hosted Local Hack Day, a hackathon, on Saturday, December 2. Over the course of 12 hours, 250 middle school and high school students from New York gathered on the first three floors to brainstorm coding projects and to execute them.</p><p>Once all of the projects were submitted, they were judged by a panel of computer scientists, and the winning projects were awarded prizes, such as Amazon Echo Dots or Virtual Reality (VR) Headsets.</p><p>Stuyvesant alumni, seniors taking advanced computer science classes, and three experienced volunteers from Upperline School of Code, a gold sponsor of StuyHacks, helped the participants with their coding.</p><p>“This is probably some people’s very first time experiencing full-on coding, and for others it’s more just practice and trying to come up with new ideas,” said sophomore Ahmed Sultan, who was a member of the group that won first place. Sultan’s group created a program called Twood, which detects the mood and emotion of a tweet. Various other awards were given out, such as Best Beginner Hack and Best Game.</p><p>“If you want to win next time or do better you try to learn how to program better,” said Sean Ma, an eighth grade student at South Orangetown Middle School.</p><p>Local Hack Day was an opportunity for programmers with varying levels of experience to work together. This year, 40 percent of the participants attended schools other than Stuyvesant. “Marketing did a really good job with gathering people from and around the city,” Wu said. “Even people from New Jersey came here today.”</p><p>StuyHacks encourages participants to see how computer science can be applied outside the classroom. “I really like that the limits of what you can do in coding and programming. The limits of telling a computer what to do are kind of limitless. I mean, your imagination is really the limit,” junior Shayan Chowdhury said.</p>	Article	322	2017-12-22 17:55:03.501694	2017-12-22 17:55:03.501694
930	﻿Stuy’s Take on the 2018 Grammys  <p>Held in New York’s very own Madison Square Garden, the 2018 Grammys come at a time when the lines between politics, art, and advocacy are more blurred than ever. The annual Grammy awards not only provide a platform for artists from all genres to share their music with millions across the country, but often reflect the social and political issues at the forefront of the national zeitgeist. Both a competition between the country’s preeminent musicians and a celebration of music as both art and activism, The Grammys conclude the previous year and set the tone for the coming year in music. While music may not be emphasized at Stuy, it is an integral part of many students’ lives and perspectives. Below are analyses of major Grammy categories, identifying and breaking down major trends, likely winners, and what the nominees say about the state of the genre.</p><p><center>Air Date: Sunday, January 28, 2018<br>Time: 7:30PM - 11PM<br>Network: CBS</center></p><p><b>Record of the Year: Hip-Hop Strikes Back,</b> by Miranda Lepri and Jevina Wong</p><p><i>Who to root for: “HUMBLE.”</i></p><p>Rap and hip-hop have historically never been favored for Record of the Year, but the diverse nominees heading into the 2018 Grammys promise to set this year apart from its predecessors. No matter the outcome, these Grammys have already succeeded in resisting the status quo.</p><p>One of the top honors of the night is awarded to the Artist and producers of a single record. The category is stacked with juggernauts like Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito,” featuring Justin Bieber. As a Spanish-language hit, it is significant that the Grammys are acknowledging the track in such a major category.</p><p>This is the first time the list has been dominated by R&B and hip-hop, a refreshing and exciting change from such a pop-heavy category. Though a nod should be given to Bruno Mars’s “24K Magic,” Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.,” off of his profound and honest album “DAMN.,” cannot be ignored and is a shoo in for the honor—especially considering the 58th Grammys, when many criticized the way “To Pimp a Butterfly” was passed over in favor of Taylor Swift’s “1989” for Album of the Year. “HUMBLE.” brings to the table both the social relevance in its discussion of rap culture and objectification of women and widespread popularity, making it a favorite for the award.</p><p>Nominated too is Jay Z’s “The Story of O.J.,” a cutting and potent commentary on the injustice and dehumanization facing the black community as a whole regardless of individual differences, giving him a total of eight nominations. Capping the list is Childish Gambino’s “Redbone,” featuring a mellow beat and unique soulful twang, a clear contrast to its dancey upbeat peers.</p><p><b>Album of the Year: Art as Activism, </b>by Shray Tripathi</p><p><i>Who to root for: “DAMN.”</i></p><p>Among the iconic lyrics and groovy tunes that define 2017 are notes of musical, political, and social change. These distinguish the five nominees for the upcoming Album of the Year award: "Melodrama" by Lorde, "4:44" by rapper Jay Z, "DAMN." by Kendrick Lamar, "Awaken, My Love!" by rapper Childish Gambino, and "24K Magic” by Bruno Mars.</p><p>Jay Z, Childish Gambino, and Kendrick Lamar share roots in rap, but each of their albums use the medium differently, with songs that are smooth and jazzy or intense and awakening. Bruno Mars is the romantic standout, and songs in “24K Magic” expand and diverge from his characteristically funky, post-disco style. The nominated albums are extremely diverse musical explorations, and a win for any of them could inspire unique change for the music industry altogether.</p><p>Lorde’s name is, among the crew, fresh but not unheard: she is the same star that swept the music industry at age 16 when her hit song “Royals” won a Grammy award in 2014. But this time, she’s four years older, and “Melodrama” shines with her fuller experiences of love, social situations, and young adulthood.</p><p>A win for Lorde would be extremely similar to Adele’s win last year for the painful album “25,” which (to popular dismay) beat out Beyoncé’s profound “Lemonade.” This year, Lamar’s “DAMN.” might be in the same position. His album expresses themes of racism and black identity and even calls out FOX News’s Geraldo Rivera in “YAH.” The Academy’s tendency to lean away from art that explicitly addresses race and identity might not do justice to his art, but this should not lessen its importance.</p><p>No matter who ends up holding the trophy, all of these artists have zeal and meaningful messages to share.</p><p><b>Song of the Year: Pop Surrenders Its Throne,</b> by Tiffany Chen</p><p><i>Who to root for: 4:44</i></p><p>This year’s nominations for Song of the Year are catchy and soulful, ranging from Luis Fonsi’s and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito” to Bruno Mars’ “That’s What I Like.” Though this songwriter's award traditionally goes to pop hits like Adele’s “Hello” and Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud,” it’s refreshing to see an R&B nomination, Bruno Mars’s “That’s What I Like” on the list of nominees, showing the growing prevalence of R&B in popular music. Also much beloved by critics is Jay-Z’s “4:44,” a thought-provoking, raw, and masterfully produced ode to his relationship with Beyoncé following her critically acclaimed 2016 album Lemonade. Both albums have gained meaning since Jay-Z confessed to cheating on Beyoncé in an interview with The New York Times.</p><p>Also nominated is the woke “1-800-273-8255” co-written by Logic and Alessia Cara, among others. While the recording academy hasn’t favored the rap genre or songs that bring up difficult and often dark themes like “1-800-273-8255,” the song’s candid message of hope and redemption may redeem it in the Academy’s eyes as well.</p><p>Perhaps not on par with the rest of the field is Julia Michaels’s “Issues.” Similar to the nomination of Mike Posner's “I Took a Pill in Ibiza” last year, “Issues” is an emotional, beautiful song, but comparatively less powerful than the other nominations.</p><p><b>Best New Artist: Surprises Aren’t So Surprising, </b> by Emma Linderman</p><p><i>Who to root for: SZA</i></p><p>With such a wide variety of genres making up the 2018 nominees, it’s difficult to predict which artist will take home the award. The 2018 nominees are made up of artists SZA, Alessia Cara, Lil Uzi Vert, Khalid, and Julia Michaels. After “Ctrl,” her debut album, garnered widespread attention, R&B singer SZA stands out as this year’s most nominated woman. A New Jersey Native, SZA’s soaring voice and plaintive, often painful themes of love, acceptance, and coming of age, have made her a favorite of many R&B fans.</p><p>Also popular is Canadian pop vocalist Alessia Cara. Nominated for three other Grammys including Song of the Year with Logic for “1-800-273-8255,” Cara is not the only nominee with a notable past; R&B/pop artist Khalid has already been named “Best New Artist” at this year’s MTV music awards.</p><p>Up for an award shown to be inclusive to rap musicians (Chance the Rapper took home the award last year), Lil Uzi Vert stands out as having created music that incorporates elements from several genres, including rock, rap, and emo. In a category that is known for surprises, from jazz bassist Esperanza Spalding taking home the Grammy over Justin Bieber in 2011 to current legends like Lauryn Hill and Mariah Carey winning the title at the outset of their careers, it is almost impossible for any nominee to be ruled out or ensured a win.</p><p><b>Best Pop Solo Performance: Less is More, </b>by Andrew Ng</p><p><i>Who to root for: “Shape of You”</i></p><p>The nominees for best Pop Solo Performance this year range from overplayed summer hits to newer pop gems. The stand out song amidst the nominees is “Shape of You” by Ed Sheeran. An upbeat, party song with an immediately catchy tune which topped the Billboard Hot 100, a feat none of the other nominees managed to accomplish.</p><p>With the nominations of “Praying” by Kesha and “Million Reasons” by Lady Gaga, the Recording Academy seems to have taken a liking to stripped down pop ballads that have recently gained massive popularity. Kesha’s vocals are not hidden behind overproduction as she belts with strong emotions about moving forward and forgiveness. Gaga similarly approached “Million Reasons” with the same idea: less production is more.</p><p>Other nominees include “What About Us,” a run-of-the-mill P!nk song and “Love So Soft” by Kelly Clarkson, an upbeat, R&B-influenced pop song which is far and away the funnest song of the five with its swanky, fast-paced beat.</p><p>Overall, the song most likely to take the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance is “Shape of You” because of its mass appeal, but “Million Reasons” by Lady Gaga and “What About Us” by P!nk also are strong contenders.</p><p><b>Best Urban Contemporary Album: No One’s in “Ctrl”, </b>by Cheyanne K. I. Lawrence</p><p><i>Who to root for: All of them</i></p><p>This year’s Grammy nominations for Best Urban Contemporary Album are arguably the best albums of 2017, all pitted against each other. 6LACK’s debut, “Free,” is a moody, lyrical masterpiece that fuses emotional R&B with trap beats. SZA’s “CTRL” is a lively R&B album with standout hip-hop influences dealing with themes of love, sex, individuality, and navigating adolescence. In the same vein, Khalid’s “American Teen” is an upbeat chronicle of youth, with love songs like “Young, Dumb and Broke” that took mainstream radio by storm.</p><p>Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” is stylistically the most creative Album of 2017 with the hit song “Redbone” that dominated the charts for months. The sound of this album is almost impossible to pinpoint. The Weeknd’s “Starboy” is simultaneously gloomy and cheery but always poetic. He displays strong hip-hop influences and plenty of rap features as well as vocal growth since his album “Beauty Behind the Madness” which won the category in 2015; his vocal deliverance is more advanced than any of his previous albums.</p><p>Present among all the albums are distinctive sounds, masterful production, and influences from genres ranging from alternative to hip-hop. Urban Contemporary was a category created in 2013 by the Recording Academy as a space for Black artists that don’t quite fall into rap or R&B. By definition, the albums cannot confined to a single genre and the category continues to provide a platform for innovative Black artists to help their music reach a larger audience.</p><p>All of the albums nominated have very distinct sounds and are the products of some of the most talented Contemporary Urban artists to date. Predicting a winner is almost impossible.</p><p><b>Best Rock Song: Calm Before the Storm, </b>by Thomas Chen</p><p><i>Who to root for: “Run”</i></p><p>Though rock music may not be as relevant as it once was decades ago, which is evident through the notable lack of rock nominees for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best New Artist, this year’s contenders for the Best Rock Song are still as competitive as ever.</p><p>The 2018 nominations for the Grammy are Metallica’s “Atlas, Rise,” K.Flay’s “Blood in the Cut,” Nothing More’s “Go to War,” the Foo Fighters’ “Run,” and Avenged Sevenfold’s “The Stage.” Of these nominees, Nothing More’s “Go to War” and the Foo Fighters’ “Run” are the strongest contenders for the Grammy. “Go to War” is Nothing More’s first Grammy nomination, but it’s clear that it is one well-deserved—alternating between gentle, softer singing and dynamic, passionate belting at a constant, fast-paced tempo, complemented by bass riffs; “Go to War” is nothing but raw and intense.</p><p>Similarly, the Foo Fighters’ “Run” juxtaposes Dave Grohl’s slightly melancholic, inspiring singing with a frenzy of guitar, drums, and screaming, ultimately creating a genuinely energetic, compelling piece. “Run”’s vaguely political themes and heavy sound differentiate it from the Foo Fighters’ past music and help it stand out from the rest of the crowd. However, K.Flay’s “Blood in the Cut” (interestingly, the only female solo rock act to have earned a nomination this year) certainly is not one to be ignored, with Flay’s moody voice gradually growing more furious with the louder drumming and guitar.</p><p><b>Best Rap Song: Old School vs. New Wave, </b> by Carter Ley</p><p><i>Who to root for: “The Story of O.J.”</i></p><p>This year’s Grammy nominations for Best Rap Song, a songwriter award, feature a few standout hits including Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar’s sweeping and pointed critique of beauty standards and hip-hop stereotypes in “HUMBLE.” (from his recent album, “DAMN.”) and Cardi B’s fiery single that reached near ubiquity this fall, “Bodak Yellow.” While nominated in the same category, these songs represent a growing rift in rap between old school lyricism and a new wave of catchy, yet shallower content.</p><p>While not quite as radio-friendly, Jay-Z’s “The Story of O.J.” is equally powerful. Like the rest of his songs in his recent “4:44,” “The Story of O.J.” touches upon a variety of controversial topics and racial stereotypes as he features numerous pop culture references and frequently responds to his wife Beyoncé’s recent album “Lemonade.”</p><p>Alongside these popular hits is North Carolina rapper Rapsody’s “Sassy” from her latest album, “Laila’s Wisdom.” You may remember her from a feature on Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly” in 2015. Finally, Danger Mouse was nominated for his “Chase Me” from the recent film, “Baby Driver” (2017). This year’s Grammy nominations are particularly interesting for rap fans as it is the first year that two individual female artists are nominated for Best Rap Song, which many consider to be an important milestone in the ever-expanding female rap genre. Most critics predict that Kendrick Lamar will win this category with “HUMBLE.” because of its innovative style and controversial social commentary; however, it is possible that Jay-Z’s candidness and heavy-hitting lyricism will push “The Story of O.J.” to victory.</p>	Article	328	2017-12-23 16:52:00.37166	2017-12-23 16:52:00.37166
933	﻿The Democratic Party is the Women's’ Party Democrats have always been against sexual assault, not because they want women’s votes, but because they truly support women. <p>As the recent #MeToo movement gains traction, people have been shocked at the sheer multitude and severity of sexual harassment stories that women have to share. There are high-profile cases of sexual assault allegations across a number of industries, including film, journalism, and politics. And though individuals of all political backgrounds have been accused of sexual assault, the Democratic Party is the one acknowledging the issue and speaking out against it. Democrats have been vocal against sexual assault, something that has always been characteristic of their party.</p><p>Harvey Weinstein, one of the most infamous subjects in the recent discussion surrounding sexual assault, has had a multitude of sexual assault allegations made against him by women across the film industry. In the past, he has donated large sums of money to the Democratic party as well as to both Clinton presidential campaigns and the Obama-Biden presidential campaign. Despite his financial contributions, many Democratic public officials, including the Obamas and Hillary Clinton, have publicly denounced Weinstein’s actions toward the women he sexually assaulted. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has also been giving Weinstein’s donations back to charity, rather than using them for campaigning.</p><p>Democrats have also acknowledged the allegations against their own party members and are making a point to support the women who have made them. Senator Al Franken, who was accused of kissing and groping former colleague Leeann Tweeden, was condemned by many of his Democratic colleagues. Patty Murray, the most senior Democratic woman in the Senate, spoke out as well, saying, “This is unacceptable behavior and extremely disappointing…  I hope this latest example of the deep problems on this front spurs continued action to address it." Franken himself made a public statement, apologizing for his actions before stepping down, saying, "I understand why we need to listen to and believe women's experiences." This is what we need to hear from  perpetrators of sexual assault: an understanding that what they did was wrong and the importance of listening to women who make such allegations. Further, as in this situation, they need to accept the consequences of their actions.</p><p>Not only have Democrats been supportive of women who have more recently made sexual assault allegations, but they have also been reexamining their reactions to those who made similar allegations in the past. The most prominent example of this is Bill Clinton, who at the time was defended by many Democrats who did not believe the women who were claiming he sexually assaulted them. Quite a few Democrats have since gone back on their support of Clinton, including former Clinton administration official David Rothkopf, who said Monica Lewinsky “deserves an apology from many of us she has never received.” Though this realization should have happened far sooner and should not have taken thousands of women speaking out against their oppressors, the Democratic party has taken clear steps and admitted their past wrongdoings.</p><p>Conversely, the Republican party has many politicians who vehemently deny allegations of sexual assault or do not even acknowledge them in the first place. Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for Alabama senator, denies allegations that he has sexually harassed and assaulted numerous teenage girls. President Trump insists that the allegations must be false since Moore has gone through many years of public service without sexual assault having ever been brought up. Many Republicans also ignored the allegations of sexual assault against Trump himself during his presidential campaign, despite his blatant disregard for women’s personal boundaries and their consent. Looking back on his actions in 1997, when he walked backstage at the Miss Teen USA Pageant, Trump said, “You know, I’m inspecting because I want to make sure that everything is good. You know, the dresses. You know, they’re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women, and so, I sort of get away with things like that.” This is a statement made by a man who was elected into the White House by his Republican allies.</p><p>Sexual assault is not exclusive to or representative of any one political party, and both the Republican and Democratic parties have been guilty of belittling it. But Republicans cannot cry wolf while standing behind their president. They should take a cue from Democrats and begin their fight against sexual assault, starting with their own leaders.</p>	Article	331	2017-12-23 17:00:17.558144	2017-12-23 17:00:17.558144
936	﻿Stuyvesant Holds Annual Festival of Cultures The language department organized a festival to showcase student-produced performances from different cultures on Friday, April 7. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>German tongue-twisters and Chinese yo-yo performances aren’t an everyday spectacle, but they were crowd pleasers at the Culture Festival held by the language department on Friday, April 7.</p><p>In previous years, the festival was held in the cafeteria, but this year, the two-hour-long performance was held in the theater. As in previous years, the aim of the festival was to expose the audience to activities from different cultures, ranging from Spain and France to China and Germany. Performances showcased various talents such as singing, dancing, and slam poetry.</p><p>The language department hoped to engage students who would otherwise not have the chance to see and interact with the more interesting aspects of other cultures.</p><p>Students responded positively to the festival. “I had a great time seeing everyone presenting the hard work they have done preparing for the show. I loved the great mix of humor and talent throughout the show. Originally, I went for extra credit, but it was super fun and exciting,” sophomore Brandon Chong said.</p><p>Similar to Chong, many noted that although they had initially attended the festival because of academic incentives, the show far exceeded their expectations. “I went to the fair last year just to watch some of the acts, but this year part of my motivation to go was an extra credit project,” sophomore Stephanie Naing said in an e-mail interview. “[However,] the talent I saw at the festival reached far beyond my expectations. The poem recited by [junior] Mansour Elsharawy, a member of the [Muslim Students Association] really stood out to me. [It] was really well delivered and the words were extremely powerful and pertained to not just one culture or race.”</p><p>Additionally, student performers emphasized how the festival gave them a rare chance to share cultural traditions with a larger audience and to bond with fellow performers. “It was my first time performing at Stuyvesant, especially with 90 other students on stage with me. It was just heartwarming practicing our parts as a group. I love the team spirit I felt from it and it really paid off,” sophomore Amy Lei said.</p><p>Other recent cultural celebrations, including that of Dia de los Muertos and Chinese New Year, have received similar regard within the school. The language department hopes to continue this trend through holding this annual Festival of Cultures in conjunction with their other cultural celebrations. It hopes that these events will offer a needed platform with which to showcase student culture and talent.</p><p>Students also look forward to similar future performances. “It was an eye-opener for many people, including myself.  I learned a lot about the characteristics of the cultures through their dancing, and the music as well. For example, this girl danced a traditional routine from Korea which was absolutely beautiful, unlike anything I have ever learned in dance,” sophomore Meredith Silfen said. “We should recognize the importance of a school like Stuyvesant that takes the time to embrace traditions and cultures.”</p>	Article	334	2017-12-24 16:34:39.763047	2017-12-24 16:37:02.468452
655	﻿Yaa Gyasi Explores Lineage in “Homegoing” A review of “Homegoing” by Yaa Gyasi. <p>I have always told myself that I will never attempt to research my family history. For me, the daunting task of unwinding and accepting what I might find on Ancestry.com seems too painful or too frustrating to even attempt. Half of my family comes from Korea, the other from Haiti. While my Korean grandparents are relatively sure of their lineage for generations, my Haitian lineage is far less certain.</p><p>My dad tells me my grandfather was a mélange truly representative of the makeup of most people of Caribbean descent. My grandmother, he says, is likely almost entirely of West African descent. However, other than stories, vague accounts of relatives, and faded photographs, I have no record of my ancestors, who they were, what they did, when and whether they were slaves, and when or whether they engaged in the slave trade.</p><p>In her debut novel “Homegoing,” author Yaa Gyasi, a 26-year-old Stanford graduate born in Ghana and raised in Alabama, explores this complex skein of lineage and history with slavery that all descendants of Africa’s Gold and Ivory coast carry with them.</p><p>While slavery’s complicated legacy is ever present in the Americas, evident both in our culture and through the oppression and inequality that still exist today, often overlooked in the U.S. is the legacy of slavery in Africa’s Gold Coast. Gyasi’s panoramic work intertwines and juxtaposes these two histories and cultures in an attempt to codify the long-lasting effects of the slave trade for both those who were captured and sold and those who stayed behind.</p><p>A tremendous undertaking, “Homegoing” follows seven generations of descendants of two ethnically Akan half-sisters in what is now Ghana. Born in the mid-18th century, they are unaware of each other’s existence. Effia, married to a white official and cursed by a fire on the night of her birth that, like slavery, “burned, up and through, unconcerned with the wreckage it left behind,” lives a life of general comfort in Cape Coast Castle, oblivious to the horrors occurring in the dungeons beneath her feet.</p><p>Her half sister Esi is captured and held in the dungeons of the same castle with “so many other bodies…that they all had to lie, stomach down, so that women can be stacked on top of them” and is referred to as “cargo” by Effia’s husband. Raped by an unnamed white man, Esi is inspected, packaged, and shipped across the Atlantic.</p><p>The story of their progeny takes the shape of vignettes, with the story of each generation occupying a single chapter, linked into a cohesive and compelling narrative by both familial ties and motifs.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most moving and heartbreakingly human chapters comes from Gyasi’s description of slavery through Esi’s daughter, Ness. Ness, who endures the hauntingly grotesque horrors of slavery, is stolen from her mother and estranged from her roots and language as her mother is given “five lashes for every Twi word Ness spoke” while growing up. Her strength is evident as she carries the weight of scars “shaped like a man hugging her from behind with his arms hanging around her neck.”</p><p>This narrative of American slavery is heightened and expanded by its imprint on Effia’s descendants. It strips identity from Quey, her son, a slaver whose light skin and broken Twi lead children to ask if he’s a white man. It returns humanity to James, her grandson, who marries a woman who refuses to shake his hand because he belongs to an ethnic group known to be slavers. James muses, “If the girl could not shake his hand, then surely she could not touch her own,” because “everyone is a part of this. Asante, Fante, Ga. British, Dutch, and American.”</p><p>Dialogue like this between chapters is what lends the novel both breadth and depth. Gyasi continuously ponders the meaning of fire and water, hashing and rehashing the weight they carry throughout generations. Fires in the night reappear in permutations to haunt descendants generations later: in the nightmares of a great-great-granddaughter for whom fire represents the trauma passed down through generations on the face of her son and in the fears of his children. A young man fears the water that once brought his ancestors over the Atlantic.</p><p>Water and Fire, two stones, one passed down through generations, one lost after the first, represent the lineages we remember and those we lose through apathy or strife. Names gain meaning as children for generations only know their parents by name. Gyasi depends heavily on symbols and motifs such as these to give structure to the massiveness of her work.</p><p>Of course, the format of interconnected short story-like glimpses into generations has drawbacks. Each chapter needs an exposition, a cast of characters to populate it, and inevitably, some characters are more convincing than others. Especially through Esi’s descendants in America, it is clear Gyasi bites off a little more than she can chew as she attempts to codify the African American experience from slavery to Jim Crow, to the great migration, to the Harlem renaissance, to the modern day. While these characters have sparkling moments of humanity and depth, they sometimes come across as conglomerations of the black experience of the time: important, but lacking depth or direction.</p><p>H, for instance, arrested for nothing and forced to work in a mine, is a dimensionless manifestation of state-sanctioned slavery after abolition. Willie, a gospel singer who moves North during the Great Migration, and her husband, who abandons her after realizing he can pass as white, are little more than tropes attempting to capture the black experience of their time period. Their son, a heroin addict in the ‘60s is an expansion of a remark made earlier in the book by James, lamenting that slavery will never end because the oppressors “would just trade one type of shackle for another, trade physical ones that wrapped around wrists and ankles for invisible ones that wrapped around the mind.”</p><p>Gyasi’s narrative prowess truly shines through the winding trajectory of Effia’s descendants in Ghana. The freedom from an archetypal storyline gives way to an at times joyful, quirky, and overwhelmingly human story. Episodes of surprising vibrancy reveal life in characters, from a kneeling mother reunited with her son who knows she is crying “by the wetness of his feet” to a housekeeper whose smile, once she realizes she can speak her native language with her employer, allows him to see “into her throat, her gut, the home of her very soul.”</p><p>Gyasi’s prose is by no means breathtaking, but as she embarks on this epic endeavor, these moments of humanity and startling clarity are the ones that stand out. A stunning debut novel, “Homegoing” is confirmation that Gyasi has much to say as well as room to grow and add depth to her prose.</p><p>“Homegoing” is a grand and painful push both forward and back. It is the struggle toward a home that may not even exist and the exploration of the roots and history that have been forcibly excised. Gyasi records and unpacks the power of truth, generational trauma, and most of all, lineage. Just as with a family, one chapter, one story, cannot exist when not surrounded by others, each supporting and engaging in dialogue with the rest.</p><p>As the Akan proverb preluding her novel states,</p><p>“The family is like the forest: if you are outside it is dense; if you are inside you see that                each tree has its own position.”</p>	Article	17	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2018-01-14 00:47:09.401476
654	﻿S()  Z()  A() A review of SZA’s new album CTRL. <p>“Am I warm enough for you?” SZA demands on “Drew Barrymore,” the first single off her debut album “CTRL.”</p><p>SZA’s debut isn’t really a debut. SZA (pronounced “sizuh”) is the stage-name of New Jersey singer-songwriter Solana Rowe, who is the first female artist to sign with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). Since acquiring her deal in 2013, SZA has released “Z,” an EP, in 2014, has performed at a variety of festivals (the most recent being Coachella), and has appeared on albums by Kendrick Lamar, A$AP Ferg, and Rihanna. She even wrote and performed on Rihanna’s “Anti” single “Consideration” and helped to write Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé’s “Feelin’ Myself” in 2014.</p><p>When it comes to her own work, SZA has kept fans in the dark for almost three years since the release of her mixtape in 2014. “Z” blended R&B, gospel, jazz, hip-hop and classic soul music into an ethereal experience. Ominous choruses were delivered over mystical background sounds, creating a sound that was dreamy, SZA’s trademark. This sound was hard to categorize because it was warm and soulful yet dreamy with heavy pop and hip-hop influences. Her distinct sound initially set SZA apart from her musical peers. Features from Chance the Rapper and Kendrick Lamar contrasted with SZA’s light vocals and allowed her to straddle soul and hip-hop. Despite the success of “Z,” “CTRL” has had little pre-album-based releases, and there are still no available links to any streaming services for the album, which was supposed to drop on October 3, 2016. Links to her singles can be found on her Youtube page: SZAVevo.</p><p>The blame for the album delay fell on her record label and SZA even called out label founder Anthony Tiffith on Twitter, saying, “I actually quit. @iamstillpunch can release my album if he ever feels like it. Y’all be blessed.”</p><p>Despite the controversy surrounding its release, “CTRL” is a colorful album. SZA’s hard hitting lyrics (“Do you really love me or just want to let me down?”) contrast with her soothing vocals, effortlessly weaving between strong beats. The distinctive warmth in her voice manifests in crisp falsettos and rich low tones but remains fresh and perky. The choruses are harmonious and catchy, resembling soundtracks from ‘90s films.</p><p>Her new sound straddles the line between R&B and pop but is strongly rooted in hip-hop, with hard beats and features from rappers like Travis Scott as well as SZA’s own bars. Since her last album, she has honed her vocal range and demonstrates her virtuosity in her ballads like “TwoAM,” a sensual but pessimistic cover of PARTYNEXTDOOR’s “Come and See Me,” where SZA sings “From this point on trust nobody outside my body.”</p><p>SZA underwent more than just a vocal evolution in the making of “CTRL.” “I’ve been working on me,” SZA says in an interview with Vogue. “[This] subsequently affects the album. Music, or the type of music that I’m writing, is very personal. Music is my form of cleansing and introspection, so I have to grow in order to accomplish it.”</p><p>Littered with ‘90s references she grew up on, “CTRL” offers a glimpse into SZA herself. The first track “Drew Barrymore,” named after the actress Drew Barrymore, reflects her more mainstream pop sound while also delving into her own insecurities and romantic failings, with lyrics like “I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth.”</p><p>Her lyrics touch on more raw, usually romantic themes, but are more polished while remaining gangsta. Her track “Love Galore” is driven by a strong beat and features a dope verse from Travis Scott, with SZA telling all her romantics interests to “skrt” because she doesn’t need them. “Love Galore” best displays SZA’s ability to be creative with hip-hop by making a love song a fresh, slang-filled club tune.</p><p>SZA’s not-really-debut debut album is complicated in the best way. It reflects SZA herself, raw and vulnerable and and versatile, not to mention immensely talented. Her music appeals to almost all audiences while never compromising her musical integrity.  In the era of New Rap where hip hop fans value creativity more than anything, she stands out by creating a new sound for herself that isn’t quite pop or hip hop, it’s SZA.</p>	Article	144	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
656	﻿“Anastasia”: A Stunning Story of Self-Discovery “Anastasia” the musical is a spectacular, grittier take on the story/movie w/ amazing music, awesome plotline, and great actors <p>“Anastasia” opens on a familiar, intimate scene. A young girl with hairbows and a delicate white nightgown sits with her grandmother, who is leaving for Paris. Her grandmother lovingly offers the girl a music box to remember her by. The gentle and much-loved melody “Once Upon A December,” begins to play as snow falls gently around them, sweeping viewers up in a stunning adventure of love, mystery, and self-discovery.</p><p>The adventure follows Anya, a young woman scraping by in revolutionist Russia, who has no memory of the past and is anxious to learn who she is. Anya is convinced by two con men, Dmitry and Vlad, that she is the lost Romanov princess Anastasia because, unknown to her, they need someone to play the part in order to collect a generous reward from Anastasia’s desolate grandmother, the Empress Dowager of France.</p><p>Gleb, a communist officer loyal to the new regime, befriends and cares for Anya while determined to ensure that none of the Romanovs remain alive. Though based off of the 1956 and 1997 films about the princess Anastasia, “Anastasia” the musical is a grown-up, grittier version, combining old favorites and striking new songs to deliver a poignant performance.</p><p>One of the most memorable new additions is a sweetly intimate duet between Anya (Christy Altomare) and Dmitry (Derek Klena) called “In A Crowd Of Thousands.” As Dmitry and Anya attempt to recreate their shared past, the chemistry between them becomes clear as the song turns unexpectedly emotional.</p><p>The reprise of the classic “Journey to the Past,” nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1998, was well done. With her killer vocals, Altomare delivers on the hopeful, passionate solo about Anya’s dreams for the future, serving as a striking Act One Finale.</p><p>The cast of “Anastasia” skillfully depicts engaging characters. Throughout the show, Altomare shines as a frightened but resilient Anya. Her strength lies in portraying Anya as a truly multi-dimensional heroine who fights off a group of drunk men in one scene and dreams of a family in the next. Dmitry is very much her equal—Klena skillfully showcases a gentle side to the cocky and cynical Dmitry.</p><p>Ramin Karimloo aptly plays Gleb, the sympathetic villain, humanizing him through Gleb’s internal conflict. Gleb, ordered to finish what his father started and kill the royal family, grapples with his legacy, his orders, and his burgeoning love for Anya. Through emotional solos such as “The Neva Flows,” Karimloo adds incredible depth to the loyal but kind communist officer.</p><p>John Bolton’s Vlad and Caroline O’Connor’s Lily, the Dowager Empress’s bright and dramatic lady-in-waiting, add some much needed lightness to the story. Their scandalous but sweet affair is full of funny moments—Vlad does squats while they kiss and their secret signal is obvious. Mary Beth Peil is perfect as the long-suffering Empress Dowager. In a setting both magical and undeniably real, the characters are genuine and imperfectly human.</p><p>Visual effects bring Anya’s world to life. A particularly striking moment is the projection of enormous ghost-like figures that twirl across the stage during Anya’s memories of a grand ball, creating a faraway, dream-like feel. Photo-realistic backgrounds pull viewers into the scene during Dmitry’s solo “My Petersburg,” in which he fondly reminisces growing up on the streets. A stunning, sunset-lit St. Petersburg rises gloriously above him and Anya.</p><p>The costumes, done by Linda Cho, tiptoe along the delicate line between historical and modern and reveal the characters’ transformations, particularly Anya’s, without the need for a single word. Dressed initially in a burlap sack-like jacket and a dowdy skirt, Anya is hard to imagine as more than the clumsy, frightened streetsweeper. The moment Anya appears in a stunning, floor-length, deep blue ball gown and white opera gloves, there is something different about her—she is now regal and elegant, perhaps even a princess.</p><p>Though “Anastasia” closely mirrors the 1997 animation, director Darko Tresnjak has strayed from the fantastical plot of the film to convey a darker, more realistic story. He plays with the time period and setting, revolutionist Russia, to add the underlying sinister threat of the Communist regime and the realities of those who live under it.</p><p>Conflicted communist leader Gleb is a new invention, replacing the green, undead wizard Rasputin and his swarm of demons chasing Anya. The complexity of Gleb’s character and loyalties intensify the conflict, abandoning simple concepts of good and bad for murkier waters. Subtle moments such as a gunshot quickly brushed off a truck and song lyrics such as “We stand behind our leaders/We stand in line for bread” quietly reveal the unpleasant truths of Communist Russia.</p><p>“Anastasia” is magical without containing any magic, setting the universal question: “Who am I?” against a dark historical backdrop. In Anya’s journey, we can see ourselves and learn to not be afraid to figure out who we are.</p>	Article	18	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
657	﻿Teens and Ballet : A Work In Progress Why are ballets not a part of teen culture? <p>Sitting down in a plush velvet seat in the upper rows of Lincoln Center, I resigned myself to two hours of confusion and boredom. The possibility that I could enjoy the ensuing ballet seemed remote at best. I couldn’t have been more wrong. The ballet, “Whipped Cream,” was a joyous but intense adventure of a boy trying to evade an evil, giant, doll-like bobble-head doctor set against the backdrop of a whimsical candyland. To my great surprise, “Whipped Cream” hooked me from the get-go with its elements of humor, stunning choreography, and magical costumes that seemed to come alive to Strauss’s music.</p><p>Though I had taken ballet for several years as a child and appreciated the difficulty of the dance, before watching “Whipped Cream,” I had dismissed ballet as an incomprehensible art form accessible only to old, rich people in ballgowns and tuxedos. My friends shared my opinion—they knew they didn’t like ballet because it was “boring,” but didn’t really know why. Ballets aren’t a part of teen culture the way other theater forms like plays or musicals are. We play songs from musicals on repeat even without watching the show (“Hamilton,” anyone?), but we’d be hard-pressed to name more than two ballets and their composers.</p><p>This is dismal in New York City, which offers a world of options: Lincoln Center, New York City Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, and many more. Tickets, compared to other forms of entertainment, are fairly cheap—ballet tickets for students can be bought for as little as $20 or $30 while Broadway tickets routinely go for hundreds of dollars. This phenomenon stems in part from a lack of exposure to ballet. Elementary school children put on yearly plays and musicals, slowly but surely absorbing show culture as part of their education. Ballet, on the other hand, is not seen as relevant to children and is therefore neglected. “The only time I was exposed to a classical ballet was [in] Music Appreciation class,” junior Jennifer Lee commented. “We know [ballets] exist, but they’re just not mainstream with most kids.”</p><p>Lack of exposure only accounts for part of the problem—even those who dance ballet as teens don’t watch it. “Only the girls who are serious about ballet watch [ballets], and just for famous ballerinas,” Masha Yepishkina, 16, added. “For them, it’s like going to see your favorite artist at a concert, but most people, like me, don’t know ballerinas.” Yepishkina, who has four years of experience at Brighton Ballet Theater, thinks ballet’s lack of popularity lies with the perceptions that surround it.</p><p>“I think that a lot of the reason teens aren’t into ballet is because it’s seen as an art form that excludes them,” Haley Henderson suggested. She is 15 and has been practicing ballet on and off for 10 years. Henderson feels that teenagers don’t see themselves and their values represented in the traditionalism and strictness of ballet. There is little diversity in ballet—ballet dancers are typically white with slim, perfectly proportioned bodies and long limbs. However, important strides have been made: Misty Copeland became the first black principal dancer at the American Ballet Theater in 2015. Her performances drew large crowds, diverse in age and race.</p><p>Along with representation, teenagers are also more attracted to ballets with flashy dynamic action, loud sounds, strange characters, frightening plot twists, and scandalous love triangles. It is not a coincidence that “Whipped Cream,” which featured all of these elements, attracted a significantly younger audience. This need for drama comes from a shortened attention span in our digital age. A Microsoft Corp. study found that today, people, particularly younger generations, lose concentration after eight seconds, as opposed to 12 seconds in the year 2000. Classical ballets, characterized by murky, often confusing plotlines and classical music, clash with our desire for quick and easy consumption of information. Songs and dances become popular because they are simple and catchy, while ballet requires thought from the viewer that teenagers often aren’t willing to provide.</p><p>Yet in ballet’s complexity lies its value, and teenage interest in and appreciation of ballet are essential to its preservation. The way to attract teens to ballet is for ballet to tiptoe along the thin line between art and entertainment, integrating the beauty and simplicity of ballet with teen values of rebellion and uniqueness. Teenagers need to see themselves reflected in ballet through more dynamic ballets and more diverse dancers. They also need to learn to connect with ballet early on, a job that falls on parents and educators. Schools need to expand their arts curriculum: school trips should include ballets as well as plays. As for teens, go see a ballet some time—you might be surprised.</p>	Article	19	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
658	﻿Jay Z Tackles The Music Video As a Cinematic Masterpiece Jay Z’s new music video opens on a very familiar set…“Friends”? But where’s the music? Where’s Jay Z? <p>Jay Z’s new music video opens on a very familiar set…“Friends”? But where’s the music? Where’s Jay Z?</p><p>This might be what you’re thinking as you watch the short film “Moonlight,” part of a series of new music videos for Jay Z’s most recent album, “4:44.” In them, Jay Z diverges from the usual music video style, doing more than just lip syncing to the song. In fact, Jay Z himself doesn’t appear in a number of them.</p><p>With some creativity and poignant storytelling, each video is memorable in its own way. “4:44” itself is a deeply personal album exploring themes of marriage, infidelity, and race, and the music videos expand on these ideas through the specific images and stories Jay Z chooses to tell.</p><p>In the album, Jay Z exposes a very real, vulnerable side of himself to the public, as Beyoncé had done with the drop of “Lemonade,” and the music videos perpetuate that quality. “Lemonade” made waves by exposing Jay Z’s infidelity and being very public with such a private matter. “4:44” has been hailed as his response to this album, and in it, Jay Z apologizes for his actions, revealing new details such as Beyoncé’s miscarriages and his rough childhood in which he shot his own brother.</p><p>What stands out about the videos is that they could work as stand-alone pieces—not just as supplements to the songs.</p><p>In fact, the video for “Moonlight” only plays part of the actual song, with most of the time being filled by a reenactment of a “Friends” episode with an all black cast and a commentary on diversity in media and cultural appropriation. Suddenly, a phone rings and someone asks, “Hey, can we take five?” The bubble is burst as the camera pans behind the scenes of the set. Ross, played by Jerrod Carmichael, goes offstage and asks his friend, Hannibal Buress, who is watching the filming, what he thinks of the concept. He gets the reply, “Trash.”</p><p>After this comment, Carmichael goes back to filming and becomes distracted, staring off into space. Carmichael tells Buress that he feels what he is doing is subverting mainstream media and making a positive statement, when in reality the concept of a black “Friends” is just imitating Caucasian media, not subverting anything. As the show continues, he is led offstage by Rachel, played by Issa Rae, to a bench. The video ends with Carmichael staring up at the Moonlight.</p><p>Additionally, the song lyrics speak about the infamous accident at the 2017 Oscars when “La La Land” was announced as the Best Film winner, even though Moonlight actually won, saying “We stuck in ‘La La Land,’ even when we win we gon’ lose.” Jay Z is commenting on Caucasian, mainstream media overshadowing the success of African Americans in media. If you look closely at the cover art for the video, typed backward and upside down, it says, “Success is never enough.”</p><p>The most popular music video, “The Story of O.J.,” plays on historical, racist Disney cartoon depictions of African Americans from the mid-20th century. Jay Z also plays on the stereotypes about black culture, including an image of him as a made-up character, Jaybo, eating a large slice of watermelon. He depicts lines of Ku Klux Klan members coming off a factory conveyor belt and even a scene of slaves being auctioned off. These images and the cartoon style reference the country's troubled past and even the present.</p><p>In statements about financial success as an African American, he advises listeners, “You [want to] know what’s more important than throwing away money at a strip club? Credit.” Later, he adds, “Financial freedom [is] my only hope.”</p><p>Despite this advice, the hook of the song seems to send the message that in America, no matter your status, you will still be regarded as the same: “still n***a.”</p><p>Tying together all these small references to America’s past and the plight of African Americans is not unlike Beyoncé’s use of images of black women throughout history in “Lemonade.”</p><p>In “Bam,” Jay Z and his collaborator Damian Marley walk around Trenchtown, Jamaica. Trenchtown is the iconic birthplace of reggae and was home to many of the genre’s most important artists, including Marley’s father, Bob Marley. Marley and Jay Z’s narration cut into the song here and there to drop notes of wisdom about music and the rich history of reggae. In the beginning, Jay Z says, “The prophets in the beginning were musicians, the poets, the writers, and that’s what we’ve been tasked with in this life.”</p><p>As the video plays, it pans to aerial views of the town, kids playing in the streets, mothers and their children, Marley and Hov in the studio, street artists making their own reggae music, and even a feature by Sister Nancy. The artist responsible for the iconic song “Bam Bam” shows up in the studio freestyling a version of the song and speaking to its timeless legacy.</p><p>These intimate moments relate to one theme of the video: people. Jay Z comments, “I feel like when I go to Africa, I’m with my people. I love people. Period.” These shots, transitions or cuts are perfectly timed to the music and beat. The video makes the audience really appreciate small cinematic details, such as when Jay Z says, “We’re all vessels, right? We’re whistles; the wind goes through us and we make the noise,” followed by a shot of trees with the subtle sound of wind rushing through.</p><p>Watching artists of different generations sitting around and discussing their music as it relates to their culture, family, and ancestry conveys a message about the power and importance of music.</p><p>Not the usual flashy music videos, these videos embody a recent trend for artists to take music videos as a real opportunity for compelling, cinematic storytelling. Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE” and Beyoncé’s entire film “Lemonade” are just a few examples in the recent past of the use of a music video as a visual medium not just to accompany a song, but to enhance its meaning and to make its own statement.</p>	Article	20	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
659	﻿Hans Zimmer in NYC: A Creative Take on Live Cinematic Orchestra Zimmer’s live performance covered so much ground, so well—not only temporally (with scores spanning decades of his life’s work) but also artistically (with practically every musical genre given its own time in the spotlight). <p>For decades, Hans Zimmer spent most of his time hunched over in a dark, windowless room.</p><p>One of Hollywood’s most prolific and highly esteemed film composers, the Oscar-winning 59-year-old has arranged the iconic soundtracks for some 133 movies—from cinema staples, such as “The Lion King” (1994) and “Rain Man” (1988), to more recent box office hits in the likes of “The Dark Knight” (2008) and “Interstellar” (2014).</p><p>He had consigned himself to the quiet life in studio recording rooms until a conversation with The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr and pop musician Pharrell Williams—both of whom Zimmer had collaborated with—made him think twice.</p><p>“At one point or another, all these musicians [I’ve worked with] said, ‘You have to stop hiding behind a screen. You owe it to an audience to get out on stage and look them in the eye,’” Zimmer said in an interview with the Chicago Sun Times. “I thought, if not now, when?”</p><p>His wildly successful European tour in 2016 prompted an invitation to perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States in April the following year, and this success generated enough demand to launch a North-American leg of his tour.</p><p>Among the final shows on his tour were two phenomenal nights (July 25 and 26) in New York’s Radio City Music Hall.</p><p>The stage was brightly lit and tightly packed—at least 50 musicians of varied nationalities and ages filled their own niche on the risers—with the choir lined across the top level, the orchestra and band in the center, and three full drumsets scattered throughout. The vocalists and soloists, along with Zimmer, were planted at the lowest level.</p><p>Dressed in a purple-tinted vest and plain white shirt with polo shoes, Zimmer took his place at the piano in the center of the stage, smiling brightly. Throughout the night, he rotated among the organ, acoustic and electric guitar, piano, and banjo, often in mid-song, without glancing at a single sheet of music.</p><p>He wasn’t another orchestra conductor in an uptight suit with his back to the audience, but a musician enjoying the camaraderie of a family—he just happened to have written the scores.</p><p>The show opened confidently, with cheerful, crowd-pleasing pieces and all of the instrumentalists of his musical team playing as a mellifluous whole. Seamlessly, the band transitioned into the high-energy Crimson Angels medley. The volume intensified and white strobe lights started flashing, building up to an incredible five-minute, three-man drum solo that shook the walls of Radio City.</p><p>As if the thunderous applause were his cue, Hans Zimmer hopped to the edge of the stage with his arms stretched widely, warmly greeting New York City with his German accent. He kicked off his introductions with accolades for the drummers, drawing another round of applause, and raving about New York’s delicious pizza.</p><p>The crowd went wild with the sudden appearance of Lebohang Morake, the original South African vocalist of the “Lion King” soundtrack, from the right wing of the stage, belting the opening verse to “The Circle of Life.”</p><p>No introductions were necessary; this had been the soundtrack of our childhoods, and Zimmer didn’t miss a beat. He had changed into a simple black t-shirt and hugged the vocalist warmly, joking about how he was much better off singing than ruining cars at the car wash he had been working at before landing the recording gig.</p><p>The “Pirates of the Caribbean” medley, starring electric cellist Tina Guo and violinists Molly Rogers and Leah Zeger, was one of the highlights of the evening. Passion sobered with playfulness radiated from each stroke of their bows. The cellist began with a classical sound and quickly layered the pieces with electronic textures, demonstrating Zimmer’s uncanny knack for integrating the orchestral sound with newer technology.</p><p>Surprises were a common theme in Zimmer’s concert: the night was a glissando of rapid crescendo followed by sudden decrescendo, sharp classical accompanying heavy rock.</p><p>Post-intermission, the legendary Guthrie Govan and Johnny Marr stepped up to the plate with their thumping bass and screeching electric guitar on full blast for the “Wonder Woman” theme, marking the climax of the show.</p><p>The visuals peaked as well: above the stage, the LED screen, which had previously displayed nondescript lines and shapes with simple color schemes, began churning out psychedelic spirals, and the lights, manned by Marc Brickman (Pink Floyd’s famed lighting director), flickered in an almost unbelievably fast lick.</p><p>Not a single movie scene appeared on the screen; in fact, the number of movies Zimmer named could be counted on one hand.</p><p>His goal was not to link the music to the movie, but to the musicians. We always pay more attention to the film than to its soundtrack, and Zimmer flipped the script. He gave his scores legs of their own, and the audience had the freedom to project uniquely personal emotions and memories onto his music.</p><p>Perhaps the most enduring part of Zimmer’s concert was not his music, but his stories. Rambling into several intimate, and often humorous, anecdotes on the quirks of composing for Hollywood, he lowered himself from the pedestal of an ‘untouchable’ deity of film music by making himself relatable.</p><p>Before the ethereal organ sounds of “Interstellar” rounded off the set list, Hans Zimmer vulnerably shared about “Aurora,” his touching musical tribute to the lives lost in a Colorado movie theater shooting during a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.”</p><p>“I had one word: devastated. And all day, I was thinking about the victims and how a word is just not enough...[“Aurora” is] a piece of music that uses no words, but it should feel as if we’re stretching our arms out, and we’re reaching across the Atlantic and embracing the loved ones left behind,” he said.</p><p>We had done nothing but listen and applaud in our seats all evening, but Zimmer made us feel like we were an essential part of something meaningful.</p><p>“When all is said and done and we’ve filled the highest high rises and we’ve built the fastest machines, there’s still going to be room for somebody to tell you a story or somebody to write you a piece of music,” he once said.</p><p>Hans Zimmer bid goodnight to New York and left the stage, only to reappear to a roaring audience for the encore: “Inception.”</p><p>The final piece of the evening was played on a dark stage, reminiscent of the studio room that Hans Zimmer had briefly left behind in order to perform. With a single spotlight on him, the film composer sat alone at the piano for the heartbreaking final chords of “Time”—the only moment he played without the rest of his band and orchestra.</p><p>He high-fived every single person on stage, dramatically air-high-fived the audience, then disappeared into the dark shadows backstage before the applause had even ended.</p>	Article	21	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

828	﻿Chaos in Catalonia The idea that all people have a right to the democratic process is one of the axioms of Western political theory. <spec-reference id=228></spec-reference><p>Catalonia, a semi-autonomous region in Northeastern Spain, has historically been influenced by French culture and customs. It remained independent from Spain until the fifteenth century, when the marriage of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile united most of the Spanish peninsula. Catalans have always maintained a strong sense of national pride, which only grew stronger in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This increasing national pride was repressed under the rule of the military dictator Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975.</p><p>After Franco’s death, Catalonia gradually regained its semi-autonomous status and grew into one of Spain’s wealthiest and most industrialized regions. Even in the modern world, historical and cultural tension exists between Catalans and their Spanish counterparts. Catalonia has its own culture and a language which is more similar to that of France than Spain. Historical rivalries between the Catalan and Spanish governments and the increasing influence of nationalism in Europe have combined to create a Catalan public that is distrustful, and even hostile, towards the Spanish government. This tension has reached a boiling point, with the regional Catalan government holding a referendum on whether or not Catalonia should secede from Spain.</p><p>In this point-counterpoint, Opinions writers examine whether or not Catalonia could and should secede from Spain.</p><p><hr></p><p>Americans are no strangers to the difficulties a fight for independence presents. In 1776, America successfully rebelled against the most powerful nation on Earth and went on to transform itself from a minor country on the world’s hinterlands into a global power. Over two centuries later, history seems to be repeating itself, this time in Spain.</p><p>Catalonia, a wealthy region of Spain with a proud history, is currently striving for independence. In what the Spanish government has declared an illegal referendum, Catalans overwhelmingly voted in support of secession in October 2017. Though Catalonia faces a long and arduous path to independence, Spain and the rest of the international community should recognize Catalonia as an independent country.</p><p>The underlying justification for the Catalan referendum is a basic right to self determination. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the cornerstone of modern international law, states that “All peoples have the right to self determination; by virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.”</p><p>Catalonia has the political and cultural traits necessary for independence. It already has its own police force, known as the Mossos d'Esquadra. It has its own flag, Parliament, and healthcare system. Catalonia even has a series of “missions,” which are de facto embassies that promote investment and trade with Catalonia.</p><p>Catalonia has its own language and regional culture that many of its citizens feel are not respected by Spain. This tension dates back to the 20th century rule of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, who banned the Catalan language. In present times, Catalan is spoken by more people than other official EU languages such as Danish and Finnish, but it is still not acknowledged as an official language by Spain.</p><p>Despite this, Catalonia, its language, and its culture continue to thrive. Millions of books are written in Catalan every year. People across Spain are familiar with popular media outlets such as El Periódico, Catalunya Radio, and TV3—some of which have been threatened with a takeover by the Spanish government. Catalonia has hundreds of years of history, great cities such as Barcelona, and artists such as Salvador Dali to its name.</p><p>Beyond being an idealistic expression of democracy, independence is also a practical solution to the concerns shared by the Catalan people. Catalonia is one of Spain’s wealthiest regions, and it is home to nearly a fifth of its total population, making it larger than four of the EU’s 15 member states. It contributes 19 percent of Spain’s GDP and a fourth of its exports. In 2014, Catalonia paid almost $12 billion more to Spanish tax authorities than it received in government funding. This has enraged many Catalans who feel that they are being forced to “carry” Spain’s economy at their own expense.</p><p>If Catalonia were to secede, it would have a GDP of 215 billion euros, larger than that of Greece. Catalonia is a center of tourism, attracting nearly 18 million tourists a year. Its largest city, Barcelona, is Europe’s eighth most visited city. Approximately a third of Catalonia’s population has a college education. These characteristics would lay the groundwork for Catalan economic success. Though the unrest caused by the independence referendum has hurt the Catalan economy in the short term, the long term economic prospects for an independent Catalonia are bright.</p><p>In defiance of the Catalan people’s right to self determination, the Spanish government has declared the independence referendum unconstitutional and jailed eight Catalan officials on charges of rebellion and sedition. It is also seeking to arrest Carles Puigdemont, the leader of Catalonia who is currently in Belgium in order to avoid arrest.</p><p>The Spanish government’s repression of the voice of the Catalan people and democracy should be condemned by the international community. Its decision to violently attempt to prevent the vote, injuring over 900 civilians, is undemocratic, a throwback to Franco’s brutal dictatorship, and a stark reminder of how vulnerable democracy is.</p><p>Due to the chaos and violence surrounding the previous referendum and the subsequently low voter turnout, Spain should allow another independence referendum. This time, it would be legally binding and allow the Catalan people to vote without fear. A BBC analysis found that over 70 percent of Catalans support a referendum. As a democratic government, it is the Spanish state’s duty to give a voice to its constituents, including Catalans. Until the Spanish government permits a legally binding referendum on Catalan independence, it will continue to tarnish its own reputation and that of the democratic world as a whole.</p>	Article	226	2017-11-30 09:31:44.334307	2017-11-30 10:31:50.80365
927	﻿Under New Head Coach, Pirates Look to Repeat as City Champions The Pirates have a strong roster and a new coach and are trying to accomplish what last year’s team did: go undefeated and become the City Champions. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>At the end of the 2016-17 season, the Stuyvesant boys’ varsity swimming & diving team had a record of eight wins and zero losses. The team also became the City Champions. This season, they are looking to replicate last year’s performance by defending their title.</p><p>There were only six seniors on the 32-member 2016-17 Pirates team: Brian Chan, Simon Chen, Lawrence Kwong, Joshua Lishnevetsky, Thomas Westfall, and Kevin J. Zheng. This means that this year’s team consists of most of last year’s undefeated team. One new addition, however, is Coach Silvana Choy.</p><p>Choy coached the Stuyvesant boys’ swim team before leaving after the 2006-2007 season. Now, after a 10-year break, she is back. “I am still getting to know the swimmers, but in the short time that I have been coaching them, it is easy to see that they are very hard workers in the pool,” said Choy about her first few days with the team. Usually, teams experience a rocky transition period following the introduction of a new coach, but Choy noted that her transition was quite smooth. “The captains have been very helpful with the coaching transition thus far,” she said.</p><p>To repeat as champions, the Pirates must have a roster of strong swimmers and divers. “I can tell you that the junior class is very strong and I expect great things from Nicholas Wen, Ethan Park, Axel Tolpina, Andrew Chopey, and Sean Roudnitsky. We are also very fortunate to have a diver, [senior] Cody Lin. He is diving beautifully and is going to contribute greatly to our points this season,” Choy said. Choy also commented on the new members of the team. “Two rookies, freshmen Osmond Wan and Tristan Pragnell… are both very talented, and I am excited to have them as part of our team,” she said.</p><p>Though the coach believes that the Pirates have a potent team, they still have powerful rivals to beat if they want to repeat as City Champions. Stuyvesant’s main rivals this season are the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Technical High School. “It’s going to be a challenge to defeat Bronx Science in the dual meet season,” Choy said. Last year, the Pirates beat the Wolverines twice, once by a score of 56-38 and the other by a score of 55-47. If the Pirates can beat Bronx Science on Thursday, January 18, they will have a good shot at becoming City Champions.</p>	Article	325	2017-12-22 18:08:14.694175	2017-12-22 18:17:07.948875
928	﻿Peglegs Face a Tough Season Following the Graduation of Key Players  <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Winter has yet to start, but Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity table tennis team, the Peglegs, is hard at work. The Peglegs have been practicing diligently in anticipation for their games this season. Having been the undefeated Division I League team for the last three years, the team is intent on continuing its winning streak. Their 12-0, 10-0, and 12-0 consecutive records in the past few seasons prove their success.</p><p>However, if the Peglegs are incapable of recuperating from the loss of last year’s seniors, it could bring those high hopes to heel. A worrisome difference between this team and the team of the past three years is the players. Last year’s seniors made up nearly all of the starters, as well as half of the actual team, for all three years that Stuyvesant has dominated the Division I League. The departure of these seniors is, undoubtedly, a huge blow. “The seniors that left the team were the core of our team. They were mentors, key players, and leaders. This year’s team, especially [junior] Katherine [Lee], [senior] Yuki [Lau], and I, have big shoes to fill,” junior and captain Allison Eng said.</p><p>This year, there are virtually no senior players in the starting lineup, with the exception of Lau. Five of the seven starting spots are going to underclassmen. However, Eng believes that this is an advantage in the long run. “One positive aspect is that our team is composed of mostly underclassmen, so even if we don't do as well as we can this year, our team has years to improve,” Eng said.</p><p>The Peglegs have fared well in the past in terms of playoffs, being 2016 PSAL Champions and consistently making semifinals and finals. However, Millennium High School, who beat them out in a close match for a place in finals last year, has become a serious contender. “Our team has honestly been stagnant over the past few years, while other teams [like Millennium] have improved over time… [Millennium’s] first singles player is training to be in the Olympics,” Eng said. A force to the reckoned with, Millennium won the first league game  against the Peglegs 5-0. With a different team dynamic and underclassmen facing the pressure of bringing home the championship without the presence of many experienced upperclassmen, Millennium’s first victory over Stuyvesant may foreshadow a difficult season for the Peglegs.</p>	Article	326	2017-12-22 18:12:01.966108	2017-12-22 18:17:46.616872
929	﻿Good Fences Make A Good Platform for Activism Ai Weiwei’s new public art exhibit “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors” is a response to the global refugee crisis and encourages the viewer to get involved instead of passively sitting on the sidelines. <p>When I asked Jéronimo Covarrubias, a Greenwich Village resident, about his first impression of the giant 37-foot-tall steel cage under the Washington Square Arch, he responded, “I thought it was pretty ordinary. I don’t know. I see new things in this park every day.”</p><p>However, the metal cage, titled “Arch,” is anything but ordinary. It seems to be an obstacle, blocking the passageway under the triumphal arch celebrating the centennial of George Washington’s inauguration. The silhouette of two people embracing is cut out of the center, allowing visitors to walk through a path with mirrored stainless steel on both sides. This is just one of more than 300 installations in Chinese artist Ai Weiwei’s city-wide public art exhibit “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” in place from October 12, 2017 to February 11, 2018.</p><p>The title of the exhibit is a famous line from the Robert Frost poem “Mending Wall,” which analyzes our tendency to put up walls to separate ourselves from other people. It is a form of protection, but it also limits the extent to which we can identify with each other. Ai’s “Fences” deals with exactly this; it is a call for activism in response to the global refugee crisis created by our unwillingness to break down the barriers we have constructed.</p><p>Ai is no stranger to using art as political commentary. His 2010 work “Sunflower Seeds,” an interactive exhibit that covered the entire floor of the Turbine Hall in the Tate Modern art gallery, recalled the hardships suffered during Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in China, which took place when Ai was a teenager. Each of the 100 million sunflower seeds was unique on the most micro of levels; each was molded, fired, and hand-painted in Jingdezhen, China, an endeavor that employed 1,600 workers. Standing in the sea of porcelain, the viewer was overwhelmed by the sheer number and depth of the seeds, which represented the Chinese people. Individually, they were small and differed from each other, but united, they could overthrow the Communist regime.</p><p>Ai’s blatant attack on the Chinese government has spurred some opposition. He was placed under house arrest, and his passport was taken away in 2011. However, he continues creating political art. His persistence despite persecution is what makes his work admirable. Though he is no longer subjected to threats of suppression from the Chinese government, his work is a powerful testament to why we need to take action, especially when no one else seems to be doing so.</p><p>Like “Sunflower Seeds,” Ai’s new exhibit depends on human interaction to make meaning out of it. The way we interact with these works is a testament to the way we interact with the ugly issue of the refugee crisis or, as Ai seems to say, our lack of interaction.</p><p>Many of these works are in places that typically don’t attract much attention, such as bus shelters, or, on the other side of the spectrum, places where there are just too many people to stop and ponder about the installation, such as the Doris C. Freedman Plaza in Central Park. The result is a feeling that the installations are almost not there. This sounds counterintuitive, but Ai uses his installation to make commentary on the fact that many of us think the global refugee crisis is important yet still live our daily lives without much thought about what we can do to help those affected by it.</p><p>For many people, the more than 200 lamppost banners Ai has put up throughout the city are easily missed. Each banner is a black and white portrait of a refugee or immigrant. Gridlines have been been cut out of the black vinyl, blurring the outlines of the figures. There is much diversity in the people featured on these posters, from icons such as Nina Simone, a Civil Rights activist and migrant, to the ordinary mothers, fathers, and children Ai met when he was in Iraq. The banners are beautiful and bring humanity to an issue that often has no face.</p><p>In the same vein, “Circle Fence,” a 1,000-foot-long ensemble of nets draped over metal frames around the Unisphere in Flushing-Meadows Corona Park, is often overlooked and underrated. It’s a strange and perplexing sight, but it has come to serve as a jungle gym for children or seating for the general public.</p><p>Thus, there’s this brief moment where most of us think the work is an obstruction, but after that moment’s over, we move on. We think about about it for a second, but then it doesn’t bother us anymore. This is much like our attitudes toward immigration, and Ai does not fail to remind us of it. The refugee crisis infringes upon our normal way of living, but after we ruminate on how it’s terrible and how we wish there was something we could do to make a difference, we forget about it until the next time it’s on the news. We end up not making that difference.</p><p>Ai is especially successful in the placement of his works. There are no mistakes or erratic decisions when it comes to the location of the installations. New York City, synonymous with diversity and immigration, is the most effective setting for the exhibit. This even works on a much smaller level. The choice to place “Circle Fence” around the Unisphere, a landmark of international unity, draws attention to the fact that Corona and Flushing are both neighborhoods that are predominantly immigrant and foreign born.</p><p>Likewise, the placement of “Arch” underneath two marble reliefs of George Washington reminds us that America was founded on the principle of freedom. The form and content of the work interact nicely, as the silhouette of two people embracing echoes Ai’s belief that the basis of our independence, which Washington is so heavily credited for today, is love and tolerance, not suppression.</p><p>However, Ai makes his most powerful and lasting statement with “Gilded Cage,” a huge enclosure made of turnstiles located at the southeast entrance of Central Park. The glittering metallic paint of the bars evokes the sensation of being locked in a luxurious prison. By placing the installation just four blocks from Trump Tower, Ai accuses Donald Trump, an avid supporter of walls who recently passed a travel ban on six Muslim countries, of being locked in his own gilded cage. This is a powerful statement to make, especially when xenophobia and nativism in the United States seem to be as common as skyscrapers in the city of New York.</p><p>There are many opportunities to react with hate and bigotry, but there are just as many opportunities to respond with kindness and acceptance. This idea harkens back to “Sunflower Seeds”—if these small, individually insignificant things are considered in their full magnitude, there may one day be a world where walls are torn down rather than fortified.</p><p>In this way, Ai effectively uses his art as a platform for activism. After contemplating the hidden meaning of “Arch,” Covarrubias admitted, “It definitely changes my thoughts about [the installation]. I want to be able to do something. I want to be able to help.” “Fences” compels us to get involved instead of simply sitting on the net.</p>	Article	327	2017-12-23 16:14:51.814752	2017-12-23 16:14:51.814752
931	﻿Jackie Chan Seems Like “The Foreigner” in His Own Film “The Foreigner” disappoints with a convoluted story and a lack of Jackie Chan. <p>As a kid, I remember sitting right in front of the television, awe-struck by the sight of Jackie Chan beating up bad guys with little effort in “The Spy Next Door” (2010) as I tried to imitate his every punch and kick. I also remember collapsing after five push-ups in the Fitness Gram that same year. Needless to say, my dreams of becoming the next martial arts warrior never came to fruition. Seven years later, 63-year-old Jackie Chan is still more physically active than me and is taking his career into a new direction with a rare dramatic role in “The Foreigner.”</p><p>“The Foreigner,” directed by Martin Campbell and based off of the novel “The Chinaman” by Stephen Leather, is an action thriller film following Ngoc Minh Quan (Jackie Chan), who seeks revenge upon the death of his teenage daughter during a London bombing by an Irish terrorist group named the “Authentic IRA.” He becomes obsessed with Liam Hennessy (Pierce Brosnan), an Irish government official and former IRA member, who he believes to know the perpetrators, resulting in a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse.</p><p>On paper, the premise of the movie seems interesting enough, especially with Campbell and Brosnan working together once again after their past success with 1995 James Bond film “GoldenEye.” The film is not lacking in terms of action, with exhilarating scenes of Quan detonating bombs and fleeing from hitmen on roofs.</p><p>Yet, plotwise, the film is messy overall and overly complex, sloppily forcing two stories into one. While the beginning shows potential, Quan’s compelling quest for vengeance becomes cast aside as he hides in the woods for half of the movie, seemingly forgotten in favor of the much more confusing political side . After being threatened by Quan and his superiors, Hennessy is forced to identify the rogue agents, who are also being hunted by the British police. But with so many minor characters and subplots—one of them bizarrely being an incestual relationship of all things—the story just becomes convoluted and hard to follow.</p><p>However, “The Foreigner” manages to be saved from total mediocrity by the intense performances of Brosnan and Chan.</p><p>Brosnan, who is arguably the true protagonist in the film, plays the role of corrupt cold-blooded antihero Hennessy well. As his plans to identify the IRA and stop Quan continue to be foiled and the pressure on him by his superiors and the British police steadily increases over the course of the movie, the cracks in his façade as the cocky, poised government official at the beginning of the movie evidently become larger and larger. He becomes paranoid and ruthless, even shooting a terrorist in the legs until he leaks information.</p><p>And though Chan gets very few chances to shine, he impresses in each, shedding his typically easygoing, humorous self for the role of an empty father with nothing to lose. One of his most emotional scenes depicts him bloodied and surrounded in smoke, desperately searching for his daughter and then clutching her body, sobbing.</p><p>Even more spectacular to watch are the occasional showdowns between Quan and Hennessy. Chan and Brosnan evidently share great chemistry, as Chan’s cold, subtle demeanor is complemented well by Brosnan’s fiery, intense performance. One such face off has Quan with a blank expression on his face, calmly pointing a gun at an angry and panicking Hennessy.</p><p>It’s a shame the film lets Chan down, as his absence causes his character to seem very irrational and slightly more unsympathetic. He spends the majority of the movie threatening Hennessy and his men, who make it clear several times that they do not know who is responsible for his daughter’s death. It’s difficult to root for Chan when his character keeps antagonizing people for no real reason.</p><p>Yet, while the plot of “The Foreigner” may have been a disappointment, Chan’s stellar performance shows that the actor is just as versed in serious roles as in his standard comedic ones. And with obviously no plans to retire soon, perhaps Chan’s future dramatic works will finally live up to the actor’s name.</p>	Article	329	2017-12-23 16:53:25.165602	2017-12-23 16:53:25.165602
935	﻿Democratic Tide...Not So Much  <p>Many of my liberal friends were satisfied by the recent string of victories for democratic candidates in the Virginia and New Jersey governors’ races. While it was certainly tempting for them to jump on these results as a rejection of Trump and predict trouble for Republicans in the midterms, this was not the strong rejection of conservatism that my liberal friends had been hoping for.</p><p>The result in Virginia was certainly surprising to most. After all, the Republican nominee, Ed Gillespie, made a climb in the polls before Election Day to only three points behind. He had only lost in Virginia in the 2014 Senate Race by 0.8 percent, with worse showings in the polling. In addition, a week before the election, the Latino Victory Fund ad painted Ed Gillespie supporters as predators to minorities. Many people, myself included, expected this to only further damage the Northam campaign and rally support toward Gillespie. After all, this is what happened to Trump after Clinton characterized half of his supporters as “deplorables.” These factors led me to believe that Gillespie had a good chance of winning in a blue-leaning state. This turned out to be massively wrong, as Democrat Ralph Northam won a convincing nine point victory over Gillespie, larger than Clinton’s margin of victory over Trump in Virginia last year.</p><p>Part of Northam’s unexpectedly large margin of victory can be attributed to his shift to the right as Election Day approached. He said on the campaign trail that he would not allow any cities in Virginia to pursue a sanctuary city policy of not enforcing the law and allowing illegal immigrants to stay in their city. This move to the right probably helped him shift the vote totals in Virginia Beach, his hometown and a largely veteran and typically Republican area, in his favor. The other two races for Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General were won by a five point and seven point margin by the Democrats, respectively. These results were both significantly lower than the governor’s race, showing that Northam was a strong candidate.</p><p>Another surprise was how much the Democrats exaggerated their success in the Virginia House of Delegates elections. While a 15-seat change from Republican to Democrat is certainly significant, 14 of the 15 districts voted for Clinton in 2016 (Trump won the district that didn’t by a mere 0.5 percent). In addition, the average margin of victory in the 15 districts that flipped to Democrats was 9.44 percent compared to Clinton’s 11.76 percent in 2016. Clinton’s election was supposed to be an example of a poor result by a Democrat, and the Democrats couldn’t even outperform that.</p><p>Many may look at these results and wonder how these fairly Democratic districts had Republican representatives for such a long time. The answer is that the Republicans tended to vote in the down-ballot races far more often, which is why they have consistently had a majority in the state legislatures in Virginia and throughout the country. The main takeaway from the recent Virginia election should be that Republicans can no longer be dependent on down-ballot success in the future as Democrats are starting to vote down-ballot more often. This means that the Republicans likely won’t be as dominant in statewide elections as during the Obama years, where they won 33 of 50 governorships and controlled both legislatures in a whopping 32 states.</p><p>In New Jersey, Republican Kim Guadagno performed very well given the circumstances. She was running in a solidly blue state, and as the Lieutenant Governor during Chris Christie’s administration, she suffered from his abysmal 14 percent approval rating. The fact that she lost by a slightly smaller margin than Trump did in New Jersey given the impossibly tough circumstances of her campaign is an impressive achievement.</p><p>While these elections have been hyper-inflated by Democrats to boost their party’s morale, Republicans cannot treat these elections as if nothing happened. After all, the GOP base didn’t show the same enthusiasm that it did in the Obama years, and that really showed in the down-ballot races. Imagine a scenario in which the GOP gets neither tax cuts nor the repeal of Obamacare passed by midterms next year. Combine that with an increasingly energized resistance movement within the Democratic Party and less enthusiasm in the Republican Party. If the House continues to pass bills at a faster pace than all three previous administrations, it may be immune to more conservative primary challengers and barely lose seats.</p><p>The more likely scenario under those circumstances is that voters will become tired of the lack of action by Republican congressmen and the Republicans lose control of the House. These elections are not a sign of the party’s collapse, nor are they nearly as optimistic for Democrats as advertised. However, they should galvanize Republicans to pass legislation to increase their majority in the Senate and maintain their majority in the House.</p>	Article	333	2017-12-23 17:01:31.356504	2017-12-23 17:01:31.356504
937	﻿2017 SING! Charter Amendments  <p>“We worked with a deadline this year, but it wasn’t implemented into the charter. It worked really well this year. As far as I know, no one went over budget for the first time ever, so we decided to make it official.” — Winston Venderbush, senior</p><p>As the 2017 SING! season came to an end, various changes were made to the SING! charter during a Student Union (SU) Cabinet Meeting on March 23. New rules regarding the fundraising process, caucus involvement, score assignment, and use of music have been established, which will be applied in the next SING! season.</p><p>At SU Cabinet Meetings, SU Vice President Tahseen Chowdhury, voting members of the SU Executive Council, which include the caucuses, a Big Sib Chair, an Editor-in-chief of The Spectator, and a member of ARISTA’s Executive Council have the ability to vote on all matters that are proposed. However, The Spectator abstains from voting and SU President Matthew So has vetoing privileges.</p><p>Every year, a monthly meeting is dedicated to examining the SING! charter. Prior to this meeting, SING! coordinators meet with Chowdhury, So, and Coordinator of Student Affairs (COSA) Matthew Polazzo to discuss any amendments they feel are necessary.</p><p>“The coordinators, as their last act, always look at the SING! charter to make minor tweaks. This is something that happens every year and this is how we solve any problems that may arise,” Polazzo said.</p><p>This year, one of the amendments made to the charter was a limit on the amount of money each SING! grade can raise outside of the SU and through student dues. The maximum amount is now $500, and if a grade were to raise more than this allocated amount, their SING! would be penalized with a one point score deduction for every dollar spent outside of their budget.</p><p>Previously, the charter did not limit the amount of external revenue raised. “The idea is that we want to incentivize the SING!’s to go out and fundraise, but we don't want somebody to be able to write a check for $10,000,” Polazzo said.</p><p>The regulation of the budget also applies to the reimbursement of students. “Even if one decided to spend their own money on SING! and [doesn’t] ask for a reimbursement, points will still be taken off once they exceed the extra fundraising limit,” Senior SING! 2017 coordinator Winston Venderbush said.</p><p>However, some believe these changes will still allow much of the same behavior to occur because there is no one who can oversee each SING!’s budget to this extent. “The budget doesn’t mean anything if you just have somebody who has the funds to spend money on the SING! without worrying about reimbursement,” junior Ray Jones said.</p><p>New rules regarding when spending has to be reported on were also introduced into the charter. The specific deadline will be set by the SU President and the SING! coordinators. “We worked with a deadline this year, but it wasn’t implemented into the charter,” Venderbush said. “It worked really well this year. As far as I know, no one went over budget for the first time, so we decided to make it official.”</p><p>Another amendment to the charter is that caucus members who wish to be a crew director, assistant director, or writer in SING! will no longer be allowed to choose producer roles. This is the case because the SU and the COSA felt that, once chosen, producers would feel obligated to select caucus members who had supported them throughout the process.</p><p>In order to further standardize judging, policies regarding scoring were also instituted into the charter. Judges will now be asked to award integer scores to each SING!. In the past, when some judges scored in decimals and others did not, the SU and the COSA had to compare each SING! on minute differences.</p><p>Additionally, there will be a 15-point score deduction if curtains are held open after one hour’s time. “We had an issue this year with a specific SING! [holding] open the curtains after time was called,” Chowdhury said. “There was no specific rule on re-opening the curtains, so the coordinators decided on a specific point deduction that they agreed was fair. Logically, it was [unfair] to re-open the curtains, but now, we added the rule based on what happened.”</p><p>There will also be a 10-point score deduction if a SING! decides to use a song that has been done in the past two years. The rationale behind this is to encourage each SING! to be distinct from years past.</p><p>Apart from the changes noted in the charter, a SING! technology workshop was introduced by computer science teacher and SING! advisor Yulia Genkina and school aide Trevor DePew this year. Members of the tech crew and the lights and sound crew were required to attend one of three lectures regarding the technical aspects of a SING! production, the intent being to prevent anyone from getting hurt. “The goal is to establish something that everybody can go to so that everybody has the same basic knowledge,” Depew said. “[It made SING!] more efficient and pleasurable.”</p>	Article	335	2017-12-24 16:39:54.560165	2017-12-24 16:39:54.560165
938	﻿Republican CEO Frank Lavin Speaks to Stuyvesant’s Young Democrats A piece about Young Democrats Speaker Frank Lavin, Republican CEO <p>“Lavin said many of the things that the conservatives who produce articles and attend our meetings say, however, people weren't so willing to dismiss someone with as much experience as him so easily.” —Kevin Boodram, junior and president of the Stuyvesant Young Democrats</p><p>Former Republican White House aide Frank Lavin spoke to students in the library on Monday, March 27. The event, hosted by Stuyvesant’s Young Democrats, started with Lavin speaking about his present endeavors as CEO and founder of Export Now. He later discussed his political views on various issues.</p><p>Earlier in his career, Lavin served in the administrations of former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. More recently, Lavin was the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Singapore from 2001 to 2005 and the Under Secretary of International Trade at the U.S. Department of Commerce from 2005 to 2007.</p><p>Currently, Lavin focuses on his company Export Now, which helps other companies establish an e-commerce presence in China.</p><p>Social studies teacher Dr. Lisa Greenwald first approached the Young Democrats after reading their newsletter, The Politique, because she noticed that they published pieces by conservatives and liberals. Dr. Greenwald believed her brother-in-law, Lavin, could share an interesting perspective with the members of the club.</p><p>Despite being a long-time Republican, Lavin had announced publicly that he would not support Donald Trump and that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>During his speech, Lavin shared his thoughts about why Trump was able to win the presidency. “[Lavin] described the fact that Clinton felt that, because she was the most educated [and knew] the most facts, [she] would lead people to believe that whatever she said was the morally righteous thing to do and […] the best thing for the country,” junior and president of the Stuyvesant Young Democrats Kevin Boodram said.</p><p>Lavin explained how Trump was different. In his speech, he mentioned that Trump recognized that there was a need for an emotional appeal. Clinton, on the other hand, never met this. During the presidential race, Trump gave the country what Hillary Clinton could not.</p><p>Lavin was asked at the meeting to explain why he did not support Trump, and he explained that his reasons went beyond differing in trade views. “He’s the CEO of a firm that’s all about trading and Trump is very much anti-trade. He was also against Trump for his rhetoric for the things he said against Mexicans, Muslims, and other minorities,” junior Mohammed Sarker said.</p><p>Lavin went on to address the possibility of Trump’s re-election. He discussed his views on what it will take for Trump to get re-elected, explaining how little he needs to accomplish in order to convince the people who voted for him in the 2016 election to vote for him again. “That kind of changed my perspective and made me realize how realistic a second term [for] Trump maybe really is,” Boodram said.</p><p>The Young Democrats were open to hearing different perspectives. “One of the reasons I really wanted him here [was] his experience. In The Politique, we've published writing by conservatives before. There are usually people who refuse to read it, much less internalize it, simply [...] because the author is conservative. Lavin said many of the things that the conservatives who produce articles and attend our meetings say, however, people weren't so willing to dismiss someone with as much experience as him so easily,” Boodram said.</p><p>Lavin greatly changed the perspectives of many of the 40 students that attended, some of whom were in the club and many others that were not. “We tend to think that all conservatives are racist, misogynistic, wealthy bigots and everything,” Sarker said.</p><p>He was also able to remind the leaders of the Young Democrats of their original guiding principles, specifically viewing situations through an objective lens. “With many Republicans like Lavin putting their country before their party and supporting nominees for other parties, [...] the time is right for Democrats to start doing the same and respond by reaching out and accepting the extended arms of people from all over the political spectrum, not to turn them away with the bigotry that forced them out of the Republican party in the first place,” Boodram said.</p>	Article	336	2017-12-24 16:40:03.73656	2017-12-24 16:40:03.73656
941	﻿Wellness on the Go  <p>Every morning, set up in front of the senior bar, is a crowd of people busily handing out white paper bags full of breakfast to sleepy and late Stuyvesant students. Called Breakfast on the Go, it is an initiative led by the Wellness Council.</p><p>The Wellness Council was created by seniors Vanna Mavromatis, Hasan Tukhtamishev, and Nicole Cheng, during their sophomore year, from the suggestion and with the encouragement of physical education teacher Dr. Anna Markova.</p><p>They wanted to educate their peers about health awareness and offer services, like that of Breakfast on the Go, to encourage students to care more about their lifestyle choices. “We tend to ignore our health and prioritize basically everything else above it,” Mavromatis said. “We wanted to try and help Stuy students make little, healthy changes here and there that would hopefully add up, at least a little, in the long run to combat specific health issues.”</p><p>Sleep deprivation was one of the first problems they wanted to address. However, early on, the leaders recognized that fixing the all-nighter culture at Stuyvesant was going to be difficult. “We knew we couldn’t make a dent in that regard, because we can’t monitor the students at home or force sleep on them,” Mavromatis said.</p><p>The next logical step was relieving the general stress levels. “Stress,” Mavromatis explained, “can lead to a myriad of health issues, especially in the long run.” Although she believes that the administration is at least partly a contributor to these high stress levels, it’s also a natural byproduct of the environment.</p><p>“If you put a bunch of high achieving kids in a competitive, work intense environment, of course it’s going to end in students neglecting their health,” she said. Their goal was to make some healthier options more convenient. She believes that the administration has been helpful in executing this goal, because they also want the same for the students.</p><p>“Although we didn’t have very many specific details in mind at the very beginning, just a general idea and hope, our plan from there was basically promoting fun, healthy events,” Mavromatis said.</p><p>The one event they wanted to do from the beginning was Duct Tape a Teacher, which they held in the annual health fair last year. Partnered with the Stuyvesant Red Cross, the health fair is an annual school-wide event where booths are set up to promote healthy diets and healthy exercise routines.</p><p>Last year, they also collaborated with the Stuyvesant Environmental Club to hand out blue wellness bottles to all students during homeroom.</p><p>“What we then noticed is that a lot of students tend to neglect their nutritional needs, such as skipping lunch to study or not eating breakfast because of a lack of time,” Mavromatis said. “This was also something we wanted to impact.”</p><p>Thus, they began Breakfast on the Go, a new initiative started this January and designed for students who came in at 7:50 or later to grab breakfast and still make it to class on time. Every morning, the cafeteria provides them with fifty breakfasts.</p><p>The Wellness Council also works with the cafeteria staff to set up. If people want breakfast, all they have to do is give them the ID, so they can record that they actually got breakfast. “We start handing out breakfast at 7:50, just because it’s only for people who are late to school,” sophomore and President Jerry Ye explained.“Other students can just head up to the cafeteria, so we wouldn’t want to waste some of the food downstairs.” They end around 8:05 and then clean up.</p><p>“Pretty much every day we’ve been doing this, which we’ve been doing for the past two months or so,” Ye continued.“We give out every single breakfast provided to us.”</p><p>Ye’s participation in the Wellness Council is largely accredited to his interest in health and well-being in general. “In seventh grade, I tried really hard to get really healthy and fit,” Ye said. “I guess that’s when I started searching up a lot of [health] articles online.”</p><p>Exploring different health initiatives has been a topic that interested Ye for a while.</p><p>“Based on what I’ve research so far, I think health culture is biased,” Ye said. Compared to the volatile worlds of politics and economics, the actual idea of good health does not shift easily. However, because it is often set aside as a minor priority, more powerful political ideals often taint its interpretation.</p><p>An example he provided was Michelle Obama’s anti-obesity campaign she avidly promoted in 2010. “Originally, it was a campaign against sugar,” Ye explained. “After she started being sponsored by some obviously biased corporations, like Wal-Mart, the campaign changed simply into a campaign for exercise. This is an example of how the corruption in the real world can shift the society’s views for health.”</p><p>Ye believes that this corruption cannot be easily pushed aside. When asked how he sees the purpose of the Wellness Council, Ye simply said, “We stand for wellness initiatives.”</p><p>Wellness, a term repeatedly emphasized in junior health classes, has a meaning that extends far beyond the dictionary definition of simply “being in a state of good health.”</p><p>“Wellness is taking care of your body, so that it can function as well as possible,” Mavromatis explained. “It’s just making sure that when you push yourself, you won’t collapse altogether.”</p><p>It’s important to mention that this does not mean there is a standard health protocol. Ye said, “It’s all about having your body feel better in the long run by properly taking care of it.” Wellness is more personal in that it emphasizes striving towards the highest potential of health that an individual can realistically achieve.</p><p>For instance, having a chronic disease does not automatically make you “unwell.” Different definitions of health may not be applicable to specific individuals, who are only concerned with their own measures of well-being.</p><p>But even so, to achieve this, everyone has to recognize the importance of health and understand how to improve it. This is the Wellness Council’s place in the student body.</p><p>Starting the next school year, Ye has big dreams for the club. “Recently, I’ve been trying to change the Wellness Council,” Ye explained. “I’ve tried to get more members engaged.”</p><p>The Wellness Council is currently a small club, and Mavromatis believes it’s because there was a lack of initiative from the very beginning. “It was often difficult to think of events that students would care about and even more difficult to pull them off,” she said. “But I’m confident that going forward, the club will grow, especially with Jerry at the helm, and now that we’ve built some degree of experience and I guess trustworthiness.”</p><p>She’s right. Ye already has plans. He wants to first separate the club into multiple departments that more people can register for.</p><p>Another idea he has is to start publishing a school-wide health newsletter. Led by the writing department, the newsletter will feature articles that promote well-being and tips for being healthy. “Examples of articles would be nutritious tips. Like, in our society, a large proportion of what we ingest is sugar. It’s way higher than it should be,” Ye said. “Or the idea that fat has been villainized, even though it is not as big of a villain as it may seem. It’s just that corporate markets make them out to be the villain.”</p><p>To have it reach a larger general Stuyvesant community, Ye is considering to either partner up with a school publication or create their own.“My vision for it is to be able to constantly pump out newsletters featuring 3-5 articles each issue,” Ye said.</p><p>With the seniors’ support, Ye is confident that they can turn the Wellness Council’s inactivity around. “We have even more plans for the rest of the school year,” Ye said. “And I’m really looking forward to implementing them.”</p>	Article	339	2017-12-24 16:42:53.250301	2017-12-24 16:42:53.250301
944	﻿Unnatural History of the Holocene  <p>In June 1884, three Icelanders rowed through the night to a remote, rocky island that was home to the world’s last pair of great auks. Like the dodo, these penguin-like seabirds were largely defenseless against humans, and were doomed by their parental instincts. Their last stand was undignified. Once this pair was located, they were promptly strangled and the single egg they were incubating was crushed. Their story appears to be a running theme of European exploration and the Holocene extinction.</p><p>The Holocene is the sixth great extinction. The five previous ones were caused by natural changes, such as increased oxygen in the atmosphere, lower temperatures, or volcanic activity, but this one rests squarely on the relatively young shoulders of humanity. The current extinction rate is an estimated 140,000 species a year, which is 10 to 100 times the average for an extinction event and 10,000 times greater than the baseline rate. This is the greatest loss of biodiversity since the Cretaceous-Paleogene event that infamously wiped out the dinosaurs.</p><p>When we look back at our collective past, we see a pattern of wiping out entire species one after another out of greed and shortsightedness. When we look forward to our collective future, it seems to be only getting worse. Extinction carries with it a sense of finality and a permanent loss to the diversity of our planet. Thus, when scientists announced it was theoretically possible to bring back extinct species, many jumped at the chance for us to redeem ourselves. But the story isn’t as simple as just cobbling together another mammoth.</p><p>In 2009, researchers produced an animal from an extinct species. A newborn Pyrenean ibex born from a surrogate mother lived for seven minutes before dying due to deformed lungs. With her death, the Pyrenean ibex was extinct again. Other attempts have proved that bringing back a species is difficult, but far from impossible. Samples of skin from museum specimens and “frozen zoos” of cells collected from the last member of a species could provide the necessary genetic material. Costs are likely to be high, but they would likely rapidly go down once progress begins because of improvements in biotechnology (similar to the Human Genome project). Despite de-extinction being possible, it may not be the best option.</p><p>At best, de-extinction is likely to waste resources that could be better spent on existing species. At worst, de-extinction could cause more problems than it solves. To be successful, researchers must bring back large enough numbers of extinct species so they could survive in the wild, and maintain enough habitat for them to not become extinct again (which may be harder than species revival). Other issues include reintroduced extinct species becoming invasive, poaching due to their rarity, and disturbing the existing ecological balance.</p><p>Currently, the question of if we should do it is a bigger issue than how. Since many extant species are also at risk of extinction, conservationists argue that the resources would be better spent on ensuring their continued survival, and that biotechnology could be used to help existing species whose numbers have been devastated to regain genetic diversity (such as with cheetahs and northern white rhinos). We have undoubtedly lost countless species before we have even discovered them; the gastric brooding frog went extinct the same year it was discovered.</p><p>We are losing species at a faster rate than we could possibly bring them back. De-extinction would not change the underlying issues of pollution, habitat loss, and human introduction of invasive species and disease that cause extinction in the first place. By putting resources into conservation and directly addressing these problems, we can save far more than one or two extinct species.</p><p>While successfully bringing back an extinct species may be an inspiring display of how far science has come and reveal new information about extinct species, there are still many undiscovered species that will go extinct before we ever discover them if our efforts are in de-extinction rather than conservation. Today, conservationists tote guns and risk their lives to protect the dwindling African elephant population. We do not have the luxury to pour resources into bringing back a mammoth. We are an unnatural disaster and may soon fall prey to ourselves unless we change course.</p>	Article	342	2017-12-24 16:44:49.173619	2017-12-24 16:44:49.173619
1016	﻿Humor Editors Flabbergasted as Writers Actually Decided to Write The Humor editors are surprised after finding out that their department writers are actually signing up to write. <p>The Humor Department of The Spectator is known for being a very lacking department, both in content and, ironically, humor. The number of articles it publishes every issue hovers slightly above the number of Stuyvesant students who get more than ten hours of sleep per week, which reached a record low this winter due to rumors of harsher anti-cheating policies. Therefore, it was not a surprise when junior and Humor editor Kerwin Chen became dumbfounded as the department writers decided to actually write articles.</p><p>“I just couldn’t believe my eyes as I logged onto my [Humor Department] e-mail,” said Chen. “People were actually signing up to write articles! Previously, the only person who wrote was [senior and Humor editor] Michael Xu, sometimes under the pen names ‘Benedict Ho’ or ‘Angelique Charles-Davis’ to make it seem like our department was functional, but I saw so many new names like ‘Tony Moh’ and ‘Victor Kuang’ that I knew it couldn’t be all Michael because he’s been too busy working on his Harvard app to write eight humor articles.”</p><p>Xu also commented on this surprising phenomenon. “I thought The Great Laszlo was playing a prank on us and writing articles, but a quick look at the low writing quality after the articles were written immediately ruled out that possibility. We are entering a new era; an era where we can finally surpass the long-loved Sports Department and reach the top of the Spec ladder, where the Opinions Department resides.”</p><p>When asked about adjusting to the new editing load, neither Humor editor was fazed. “It doesn’t matter if we have one or 20 articles,” Chen said. “I don’t even bother editing [the articles] anymore. No one reads the Humor section anyway.”</p>	Article	414	2018-01-23 02:57:46.278655	2018-01-23 02:57:46.278655
850	﻿Setting New Standards After being repeatedly unsuccessful in a class, there’s less incentive to try harder as each attempt seems more and more futile. <p>At the beginning of each school year, the most common topic of conversation at Stuyvesant is “Who are your teachers?” This is followed by either a groan at the excruciating months to come or a silent “thank you” to the computer algorithm that granted the student good fortune in the form of an easy 95.</p><p>At Stuyvesant, grades are partial because they depend largely on your teacher and often reflect luck rather than merit. While there are always good and bad teachers, one thing that can be changed is the standardization of the difficulty of classes by assistant principals at Stuyvesant.</p><p>Colleges don’t take the teacher of a class into consideration, nor is it possible to translate teacher difficulty into a numerical curve on the student’s average. Admissions officers can’t keep tabs on every teacher at a school, especially with the tens of thousands of students from hundreds of schools who apply for elite U.S. colleges each year. Since colleges are easily deceived by an unrealistic GPA from an easy course and teacher, and thus might unfairly reject students who simply got the short end of the stick, introducing set, written standards for grading and keeping exam difficulty constant will give colleges a more truthful view of students’ academic achievement.</p><p>Often, students with comparatively harsh graders lack the same confidence of their higher scoring peers. Stuyvesant offers a wealth of advanced classes, but there’s a fine line between a class being difficult yet fair and totally impossible. Classes that are unreasonably difficult can take a toll on student confidence in their academic ability, causing students to do worse on schoolwork and tests.</p><p>A study by Open Colleges indicated that “confidence increases from beginning to end in a course, provided the students perform adequately.” After being repeatedly unsuccessful in a class, there is less incentive to try harder as each attempt appears more and more futile. Sophomore Ilona Khimey stated, “I get very discouraged when a teacher doesn’t reward my effort at all, and when I see friends trying two times less doing 10 points better.”</p><p>Alternatively, the institution of standards maximizes learning, because standards are written by authorities with educational experience who understand what information will help students in the long run.</p><p>Standardization is achievable by keeping exam difficulty constant throughout all classes of a subject and creating Common Core-like guidelines to communicate to students, parents, and staff what students should and should not be learning. The final exam should be built upon these standards to fairly measure the skill of the student and teacher. If many students for a certain teacher score poorly on the final exam, then it is a clear indicator that the teacher should begin shaping his or her curriculum to fit the standards better.</p><p>For instance, if all of a teacher’s students failed the history final, while students with other teachers did well, the scores would reflect more on that specific teacher than his students, creating a system of enforcement. This way, there are no “tough” teachers and no “easy” teachers; everyone stays on the same playing field, learning generally the same material, making college admissions much more fair, program changes less hectic, and giving students an easier time overall.</p><p>This in no way limits a teacher’s creative autonomy in terms of how they want to teach the material. If a teacher’s job is to introduce students to a set curriculum, this should be done regardless of personal teaching style. They’re still able to instruct their classes however they want and add as much information as they deem necessary, just as long as they still teach the required material.</p><p>Making the curriculum clear and consistent for every teacher will also eliminate superfluous information that teachers often throw into their curriculum because of personal preferences, saving time and effort. If the student isn’t learning what the standards say he or she should be learning, it’s easy for the teacher to be alerted, because standards are set in stone.</p><p>Right now, success in Stuyvesant can’t be attributed to solely intelligence. Luck is arguably just as important in maintaining a high GPA. While conflating natural abilities with the numbers on our transcript is a mistake most students make, the stress of maintaining good grades makes it hard to evaluate ourselves otherwise. Standardizing curriculums would bridge the gap between fairness and the ability to succeed, leveling the playing field once and for all.</p>	Article	248	2017-12-01 20:29:49.250718	2017-12-01 20:29:49.250718
939	﻿StuyPulse Takes On South Florida Regional Competition Piece about StuyPulse’s win at the South Florida Regional. <p>Stuyvesant’s award-winning For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) Robotics team, StuyPulse, attended the South Florida Regional Competition from March 1 to March 4, and left with the prestigious Chairman’s Award. The last time StuyPulse was awarded this honor was in 2012.</p><p>They were one of 6,000 other First Robotics Competition (FRC) teams; among them were teams from Brazil, Colombia, and Turkey. Winning the Chairman’s Award allows StuyPulse to advance to the FRC World Championship in St. Louis from April 26 to April 29. The World Championship gives the team a shot to be inducted into the FRC Hall of Fame.</p><p>Qualification for the Chairman’s Award required additional aspects of preparation, including a presentation on the team’s community and outreach projects. This presentation included an essay, executive summary, short video, and oral presentation about the team.</p><p>“It’s part of FIRST’s mission to inspire others about science and technology, and encourage them to be leaders, and as teams part of FIRST, we believe that it’s essential to stay true to its values and mission,” junior Yedoh Kang said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Heads of the StuyPULSE marketing team, senior Courtney Chiu and sophomore Lamia Bushra, presented StuyPulse’s achievements to a small panel of judges.</p><p>The theme of this year’s competition was FIRST Steamworks. The goal of the competition was to create a steampunk-themed robot using gears. The robots were tested on certain abilities. “This year the tasks the robot could complete were to pick up gears and assemble them into a machine, pick up wiffle balls and fire them at a goal, and climb up a robot to hit a button,” senior and President of Engineering Jonah Sachs-Westone said. The StuyPulse team worked on the robot over the course of six weeks before shipping it off to Florida.</p><p>The team faced a few issues while in Florida and made it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated. A fuse in the control system blew right before the final match, disqualifying them from competing.</p><p>In order to be inducted into the FRC Hall of Fame, they must win the Chairman’s Award again at the World Championships. “[The FRC Hall of Fame] features the best of the best, and because we’ve never won before, StuyPulse is definitely working really hard to be a Hall of Fame team,” Kang said.</p><p>Before heading off to St. Louis, however, StuyPulse’s next competition is the New York City Regional at the Armory Track and Field Center from April 7 to April 9. Once again, they will be competing amongst top teams from all over the world and be aiming to take home the Chairman’s Award.</p>	Article	337	2017-12-24 16:40:17.65872	2017-12-24 16:40:17.65872
940	﻿Sandler Wins Williams’s George Olmsted Jr. Class of 1924 Prize History teacher Robert Sandler will be awarded the George Olmsted, Jr., Class of 1924 Prize at Williams College on the weekend of Saturday, June 3. <p>History teacher Robert Sandler won the George Olmsted Jr. Class of 1924 Prize for Excellence in Secondary School Teaching from Williams College on Friday, March 10. He was nominated by former student, Aglaia Ho (’13), who was in Sandler’s AP United States History and New York City History classes.</p><p>The Olmsted Prize is awarded every year to four high school teachers during Williams’ “Ivy Exercises,” an award ceremony Williams holds annually. Every year, Williams seniors are given the opportunity to nominate a teacher that played an influential role in their education and lives for the award. Seniors who decide to participate have to submit an essay explaining the impact their teacher made on them.</p><p>Teachers are then notified of their nomination and are asked to submit an essay explaining their teaching philosophies and provide examples of exemplary student projects.</p><p>In his essay, Sandler wrote about the various activities he uses to engage students. “I conduct walking tours, have a lot of guest speakers, and use simulations with historical figures,” Sandler said in an e-mail interview. He also explained how he attempts to incorporate music and art into his lessons.</p><p>Williams also requested  recommendation letters from colleagues or supervisors.“I had to get recommendations from [Assistant Principal of Social Studies Jennifer] Suri, the principal [Eric] Contreras, and James Basker, the President of the Gilder Lehrman Institute for American History,” Sandler said.</p><p>“I thought he had a really great chance [of winning] because he’s such a great teacher. I know [his] students are very enthusiastic and many of his students still keep in touch with him and have written letters to him about the impact that he had on their lives and careers,” Suri said.</p><p>After applications were submitted, a committee of faculty, staff, and Williams juniors chose four winners who would each be given $3000 and an additional $5000 would be awarded to their schools.</p><p>Williams will cover the cost of the trip to the award ceremony on Saturday, June 3, for the recipients and their families, along with the honorary degree recipients. Attendees will go to a luncheon with both the Olmsted committee and the student nominators and their families. Afterwards, at the Class Day “Ivy Exercises,” the dean of Williams will present each recipient and the student that nominated them.</p><p>Sandler is looking forward to the award ceremony. “I have never been to the Berkshires and I think it will be really fun to meet my old student and her family at the ceremony,” Sandler said.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Sandler has won an award for his teaching. In 2013, he won the National Council for the Social Studies National Teacher of the Year Award and an award through the 9/11 Tribute Center for creating a curriculum unit on 9/11. In 2014, he was awarded the New York State History Teacher of the Year Award presented by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, after being nominated by his former student, Mitchell Teper (’15).</p><p>Senior Prangon Ghose, who was in Sandler’s Jewish History class and is now in his New York City History class, believes that a part of what makes Sandler deserving of the award is that he inspires his students to learn more about topics beyond what is taught in class. “It is not always that one has a teacher like Mr. Sandler. I think he truly cares for the students he teaches and strives to provide better learning opportunities for them outside of the classroom,” Ghose said in an e-mail interview. “Mr. Sandler truly deserves this award and he serves as a strong example to teachers around the country that they can make important changes in a student's life that makes him [or] her a better person. Awards like the Olmsted Award are important to impress upon our society that teaching is an [influential] profession.”</p><p>Sandler plans on spending the $5000 given to the social studies department from this award to buy books, films, and to go on field trips with his elective classes. He hopes that winning this award will help change the common public perception of teachers. “It will be a small step in counteracting negative stereotypes about teachers,” Sandler said. “I love my job and respect my colleagues intensely. There are so many hardworking teachers that stay [until] 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. and work all weekend. They all deserve recognition.”</p>	Article	338	2017-12-24 16:41:18.092147	2017-12-24 16:41:18.092147
942	﻿Transgender at Stuyvesant: Transgressing Boundaries Spread featuring trans kids at Stuy who talk about their high school experience and their experience being trans. <p>As a student body, it is our duty to make sure that every student at Stuyvesant feels safe and welcome and that we acknowledge every single one of our peers with the same level of respect. However, the transgender community at Stuyvesant often goes unheard and unnoticed. Meet four transgender Stuyvesant students who each have something unique and special to add to the Stuyvesant community.</p><p><b>Eleanor Loprest, Agender (They/them)</b></p><p>Freshman Eleanor Loprest has always had a strong grasp of music. They first gravitated towards the piano at the age of two and a half, and they have sharpened their skills ever since, discovering their passion for singing and composing along the way.</p><p>However, Loprest’s understanding of gender is not nearly as strong as their understanding of music. In fact, they don’t have any grasp whatsoever on the concept of gender.</p><p>Loprest is perplexed by the gender binary, and thus does not identify as any gender at all. Instead, Loprest identifies as agender, a label used to indicate the lack of a gender identity.</p><p>Since coming to Stuyvesant, Loprest has found that their gender identity—or lack thereof—has confused many of their peers and teachers.</p><p>Yet, most people Loprest has encountered at Stuyvesant have made an effort to understand and respect Loprest’s identity despite their confusion, referring to Loprest with their preferred pronouns (they/them/their) and correcting people who misgender them.</p><p>Nevertheless, some people have a harder time using Loprest’s correct pronouns, like a teacher who resorted to not referring to Loprest with any pronouns and simply addressing them as “Eleanor.”</p><p>Seldom has Loprest felt directly attacked for being agender since coming to Stuyvesant, but there have been several instances where people have treated Loprest’s identity as a joke or insisted on addressing them with she/her pronouns.</p><p>Loprest has found the most welcoming communities at Stuyvesant to be the people they met through participating in the eighth period chorus, where they sing in the soprano 1 section, and Stuyvesant Spectrum, the SPARK club geared towards promoting LGBTQ+ causes and advocacy.</p><p>“My first thought when coming to Stuy[vesant] was ‘I need to find the queer people,’” they said. Since coming to Spectrum, they are happy to say that they have found the queer people they had been looking for and that they have a strong, passionate support system in a school that can sometimes feel so impersonal.</p><p>Stuyvesant is a challenge for everyone who walks through the cold metal doors of the bridge entrance each morning, but Loprest has begun their journey with their head held high. An intellectually curious person with high aspirations, they are happy to be at Stuyvesant. Despite the occasional bothersome and mildly transphobic comment, Loprest remains unfazed, and with an unbreakable smile across their face, they say, “A school stomping on my identity will not stop me from existing.”</p><p><b>Connie Walden, Genderqueer (They/them)</b></p><p>From the band room to the SPARK office, junior Connie Walden, with artificially colored hair and a distinct androgynous style, can be seen in all corners of the building carrying a messenger bag adorned with scores of pins.</p><p>Walden, a hacker, a trumpeter, a poet, and an activist, has made a name for themself in several ways since coming to Stuyvesant, but what many don’t know about Walden is that they identify as genderqueer and prefer to be addressed by they/them pronouns.</p><p>Since realizing they were gender non-binary in the beginning of their sophomore year, they have chosen to keep their gender identity relatively under the radar at Stuyvesant. “I don’t want it to be a defining factor of who I am. It’s not something that I want to be a big deal in my life,” they remarked, well aware that coming out as genderqueer entails confusion and possible harassment from peers.</p><p>Because Walden is well-acquainted with many different social circles at Stuyvesant, they are afraid that coming out to everyone at Stuyvesant will limit who they can be friends with.</p><p>They have found that many of their socially conservative friends make offensive jokes about non-binary genders and the transgender community as a whole. This practice doesn’t hurt Walden on a personal level, but is something they wish would stop.</p><p>Nevertheless, Walden has come out to many of their peers, facing a mixed array of reactions, not all of which have been positive.</p><p>For example, when they decided to wear eyeliner to school one day, they received several perplexed and sour glances, many of whom were from boys in the boys’ bathroom and locker room. “I’ve also received many positive, enthusiastic responses [to coming out], but they’re hard to notice when you’re scared to death of the negative responses,” Walden said.</p><p>While Walden has not found it easy to fully express their gender at Stuyvesant, they are taking cautious baby steps on their way to being comfortably out of the closet. “I’m out to several teachers, and I even go by Connie in some of my classes,” they said.</p><p>However, though many of Walden’s teachers are supportive and understanding, others harbor an old-fashioned mindset and don’t have a good understanding of what it means to be genderqueer.</p><p>To help people better understand matters involving the transgender community and other marginalized communities, Walden has dedicated much of their time to the causes they believe in. Recently, with the help of SPARK, they co-founded a publication at Stuyvesant with junior Pacy Yan called StuySpeaks, a space for underrepresented minorities to voice their struggles for liberation and social and economic equality.</p><p>Walden is also making a difference in the greater New York City community by volunteering at Bluestockings, a feminist, trans-friendly bookstore and café on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Walden described the environment of Bluestockings as radical, but comfortable.</p><p>“At Bluestockings, you don’t feel weird because of the gender you identify as. All volunteers are mandated to introduce themselves by their pronouns,” Walden explained.</p><p>Walden is also the president of StuyHack,  a math and computer science enthusiast, and is equally invested in music and writing. Walden plays the trumpet for the Stuyvesant jazz band and won a Scholastic Gold Key Award for poetry this year.</p><p>The next time you see Walden roaming around the Stuyvesant building, don’t be shy to approach them, because you’ll be bound to spark up an intriguing conversation of your own.</p><p><b>Kiran Vuksanaj, Female (She/her)</b></p><p>Like many people whose middle school experiences were subpar, freshman Kiran Vuksanaj came to Stuyvesant looking to reinvent herself. However, to Vuksanaj, this meant more than a drastic change in style—she was going to begin publicly presenting as female. Starting high school was a chance for her to introduce herself to people by her preferred name, Kiran, and her preferred pronouns, she/her. “It’d be easier for people to get used to calling me by my preferred name and pronouns, since it’s not like they have to unlearn the old [name and pronouns],” Vuksanaj explained.</p><p>Vuksanaj had known she was a transgender girl since she was twelve years old, and even before she knew what the word “transgender” meant, she knew she never felt comfortable being called a boy.</p><p>Before she came to Stuyvesant, she was only out to several close friends and family members.  Now, she has made sure that the Stuyvesant administration and all of her peers and teachers know her preferred name and pronouns.</p><p>Vuksanaj’s mother explained her situation to the Stuyvesant administration, and they did all they could to accommodate her. “They really do try and support me, which feels amazing. I’m allowed to use the right bathroom, and I have the right name on my ID card next to my legal name,” Vuksanaj noted.</p><p>She has also found the SPARK office and Spectrum, Stuyvesant’s gender and sexuality alliance, to be incredibly helpful resources. The SPARK office, as the school’s designated safe space, gives her a sense of social and emotional support.</p><p>Likewise, Spectrum has proven to be a passionate and supportive community of students, many of whom are transgender themselves.</p><p>Since coming to Stuyvesant, Vuksanaj has made an effort to surround herself with good people. She has particularly involved herself with Spectrum and the Transit Association, and she hopes to join more clubs in the future.</p><p>However, with every new club she has tried out, she has made sure to choose her friends wisely. “I know there are people [at Stuyvesant] who wouldn’t respect me, but I’ve done my best to avoid them,” she told me, though she said that she has occasionally heard derogatory comments in passing.</p><p>Through the Transit Association, Vuksanaj has been able to express her passion for transit systems. Reflecting on her love for trains, she said, “When I get into things, I get really into them.” As such, she has spent the past year expanding her knowledge of the MTA, exploring obscure buses and trains, and learning about their history.</p><p>Somewhat connected to her love of trains is her love of physics. Physics was Vuksanaj’s favorite subject in middle school, and she has considered it as a potential career option for the far future.</p><p>As a biracial and bisexual transgender girl, she knows that she is rather underrepresented in scientific fields, but, if anything, that has only further encouraged her. “I remember searching the internet for trans women who were successful in scientific fields, and finding out who they were was a really exciting and hope-filling moment for me,” she remarked.</p><p>A kind person with a passion for how things work, Vuksanaj has enjoyed her time at Stuyvesant thus far. She hopes to continue to make friends here and blossom as a scientist and a train enthusiast. Though it is not often that we see transgender women of color working in our labs, Vuksanaj can help pave the way for future Stuyvesant students, because she is a trailblazer in her own right.</p><p><b>Kris Khalilova, Genderfluid (They/them)</b></p><p>As soon as I sat down with sophomore Kris Khalilova for their interview, they were eager to tell me their emotional rollercoaster of a coming out story from start to finish.</p><p>Khalilova’s coming out story is quite unusual, because they came out as both pansexual and genderfluid, two labels entirely foreign to Khalilova’s traditional Russian family. “My parents are homophobic, so I grew up with a lot of internalized homophobia,” Khalilova remarked.</p><p>As such, Khalilova struggled with familial and self-acceptance when first discovering their identity, but it is these revelations that would shape the next chapter of Khalilova’s life.</p><p>At the time that Khalilova realized that they did not feel comfortable restricting themselves to a male or female gender identity, several of their middle school friends came to similar realizations.</p><p>Khalilova’s friends provided a sense of safety and community amidst a world of chaos and confusion. It was then that they and their friends were beginning the gruesome process of applying to high school.</p><p>For Khalilova, this process was especially challenging, because they had to research each school they considered applying to to determine whether or not it was a safe place for queer and transgender individuals.</p><p>When it came to making a final decision, Khalilova chose Stuyvesant because they had read in a news article that it was an LGBTQ+ friendly school.</p><p>Upon coming to Stuyvesant, however, they have found that this is not always the case. According to Khalilova, Stuyvesant is only “sort of okay” in terms of LGBTQ+ friendliness.</p><p>They seldom experience outright harassment for their identity, but they presume that is because they look traditionally female enough to pass as cisgender and straight.</p><p>Nevertheless, they hear people make derogatory jokes at the expense of the transgender community and patronizingly refer to transgender people as “special snowflakes,” comments that make them feel particularly uncomfortable. However, they know that most of these comments come from a place of ignorance and not hate.</p><p>“I may pass as female and have many of the societal advantages and disadvantages distinct to the female gender, but I am not a girl,” they told me matter-of-factly.</p><p>As a genderfluid person, Khalilova does not identify as a single gender—their gender identity varies by day. “Some days, I feel very girly, and other [days], I’m like, ‘Hey! I’m a dude!’ Sometimes I feel like neither,” they explained. For this reason, they feel that the gender neutral pronouns “they/them” fit them best.</p><p>The most open-minded, welcoming, and kind people Khalilova has met at Stuyvesant have been at Spectrum. A regular attendee of the club, they have found a sense of belonging there and made several lasting friendships. To Khalilova, Spectrum has been an especially helpful resource to have when their identity has left them at odds with their parents.</p><p>“Even though I have come out to my mom, she still refers to me as her daughter, and the only time my dad has ever spoken to me about my sexuality or gender was when he told me to take down the pride flag in my room because our relatives were coming over,” they said.</p><p>Though coming out has not been the easiest journey for Khalilova, they feel especially fortunate to be surrounded by good people at Stuyvesant.</p><p>A sweet, amiable person, all they wish is that Stuyvesant students would be more accepting of their transgender peers. “If someone you know has trusted you enough to tell you their true gender identity, don’t question them. Just love and accept them for who they are,” Khalilova advises the student body.</p><p>Even if you don’t consider yourself to be transphobic, they suggest you give their words some thought. After all, if everyone heeded Khalilova’s advice, Stuyvesant would be a significantly better place.</p><p><hr/></p><p>No two transgender students at Stuyvesant are the same, but they all have something in common: they are unique, creative individuals who, with their distinct brands of intellectual curiosity, are able to make Stuyvesant their home.</p>	Article	340	2017-12-24 16:43:01.91823	2017-12-24 16:43:01.91823
943	﻿London Terror Attack: Is Immigration to Blame?  <p>Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader and presidential candidate, immediately condemned the attack in London, not by offering her condolences, but by asserting that “we must control our borders.”</p><p>Alienated from contemporary society by governments and populations alike, Muslims in Europe have had a lot to resent, which has made them a prime target for radicalization.</p><p>There is a lack of Muslim representation within local and national European politics, which causes governments to be unable to address the issues of their Muslim populations.</p><p>Focus: Politicians have used the attack in London to further their anti-immigration rhetoric, but it is not immigration to blame for this attack and others.</p><p>Terror struck the heart of London on March 22, 2017, when Khalid Masood carried out a reprehensible terror attack that left five people dead. Without hesitation, European leaders used the attack as an opportunity to further their anti-Muslim immigration rhetoric. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader and presidential candidate, immediately condemned the attack in London, not by offering her condolences, but by asserting that “we must control our borders.”</p><p>This rhetoric plays into the larger narrative of fearing and halting immigration championed by Le Pen and her Front Nationale. In the aftermaths of the attacks in Paris, Nice, and now London, other European leaders have also advocated for barring immigration. Nigel Farage used these attacks to bolster his anti-immigration platform during the Brexit vote, playing off of the fear of terror attacks within Europe.</p><p>During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump also played off of the fear of terrorism and issued an executive order which barred entry of anyone from several countries in the Middle East, such as Syria, Libya, and Iraq, into the United States. Although this order was shut down in the Federal Court system, the intent to further discriminate against migrants and visa-holders alike from Muslim nations remains in the administration.</p><p>This narrative is little more than fear-mongering. Masood was born and raised in the United Kingdom to British parents. He was a citizen radicalized within the country.</p><p>In France and much of Europe, Muslims have had a contentious history with the rest of the population. Many Muslims immigrated to Europe during the period of decolonization in the 1950s and ‘60s, but were forced to live in slums and among the lowest rungs of society. There was little effort from European governments, who saw them as temporary workers, to assimilate these populations. Alienated from contemporary society by both governments and people alike, Muslims in Europe have had a lot to resent, which has made them a prime target for radicalization.</p><p>But how does this relate to modern-day radicalization? The answer is that Muslims in Europe have not yet moved out of the slums they occupied 50 years ago, and because of their lower standing in society, they have also been targets of recruitment from terror groups. Masood was allegedly radicalized by Sheikh Abu Hamza, an Imam in England who was recently arrested for inciting terror. The New York Times notes that homegrown terror has taken a greater toll than jihadis coming from the Middle East, and yet the rhetoric of our politicians tends to focus on threats outside of our country rather than inside.</p><p>Le Pen is an outspoken proponent of the French ideal of Laicite, the full assimilation of religious minorities into the mainstream. This belief permeates her speeches and her support of policies, such as the now-infamous Burkini ban. But instead of assimilating Muslims, this belief only serves to increase resentment in Europe’s Muslim communities, as Jeffrey Reitz, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto, explains. He believes that “many young Muslim women feel an underlying resentment. They have to take off the headscarf when they get to school, but they put it back on immediately when they leave, feeling that it’s an important way to defend their identity.”</p><p>It is clear that the reactionary speeches and policies coming from Europe’s leaders aren’t solving any problems, but there is a way for European leaders to fight radicalization. The first action these leaders can take is to work with Muslim communities to better understand the problems that these communities face. There is a lack of Muslim representation within local and national European politics, which causes governments to be unable to address the issues of their Muslim populations.</p><p>Second, governments need to provide more resources to these communities, which, on average, receive less government benefits and attention: in France, entire Muslim neighborhoods are left unpoliced. In the 1950s, European governments pushed Muslim immigrants into shantytowns and largely ignored them, and for the past 70 years, this has not changed.</p><p>Most importantly, Europeans need to be more accepting of Islam. Secularism in Europe is different than in the United States; across the pond, it means the general abdication of religion by the mainstream. This is why policies, such as the Burkini-ban, are so hotly contested within Muslim communities: their need to maintain key elements of their culture comes at odds with the rest of society, which wants them to abandon their culture entirely.</p><p>Retaliatory rhetoric does little to help in the fight against radicalization and terror. Yet, in the wake of terrorist attacks, the public finds solace in these very words coming from politicians. If we want to end the issue of radicalization in both Europe and in the United States, we should instead expect our leaders to pursue policies that solve these issues and espouse rhetoric that does not alienate our Muslim populations.</p>	Article	341	2017-12-24 16:43:20.357104	2017-12-24 16:43:20.357104
945	﻿A Moral Economy A Moral Society Needs a Moral Economy <p>Outqoutes: “we need to prevent growing wealth inequality by encouraging a wider distribution of capital between firms and employees”</p><p>A little more than eight years ago today, the world was on the brink of utter collapse. While many of us were adjusting to a new school year, our parents, teachers, neighbors, and everyone else were overwhelmed with anxiety as they saw markets tumble. Despite the government’s attempts to remedy anxiety arising from the crash, the  U.S. economy has had a sluggish recovery and its people and businesses are in enormous debt. In short, the 2008 financial crash radically changed our economic system; it looms over us as a foreboding warning of dangers of our economy.</p><p>The 2008 crash came as a surprise; mainstream economists believed that the current system was stable and could provide unseen prosperity. In fact, they not only failed to predict the crash but have also been unable to create models to explain it. This inability shows that our economic system is fundamentally flawed. Specifically, our system focuses not on providing for the welfare of the people but on generating wealth through primarily financial ways. By analyzing the flaws that caused the 2008 crash, we can construct an economic system that does not exist solely to create wealth but rather to uplift others and help everyone live meaningful lives.</p><p>First, our economy is based on the idea that humans, institutions, and corporations are self-interested entities concerned with the maximization of their pleasure and the value of their shareholders. Therefore, economic transactions are thought of as joint meetings of two entirely separate individual interests.</p><p>Due to this self-interested view of human nature, our economic system reduces goods to their material significance to ensure the vast creation of wealth. I have lived in a house for the past four years. Over that time, I have formed countless memories with my neighbors and family. I am unable to separate material shelter and emotional significance when I think about my home. However, this separation is exactly what our economic system does. In the case of a house or land, it severs symbolic significance and only considers certain material aspects in valuing the property, commodifying goods into fungible assets.</p><p>This reduction allows bankers to construct a speculative and interconnected financial system. Consider a market for coffee beans with a going price of $10 per pound. Suppose I want to be able to buy 100 pounds of coffee for $11 two months from now. I would draw up a contract, called a derivative, with a farmer for the right to buy those coffee beans, and the contract would cost me an upfront premium. If in two months the price goes up to $15, I can sell the contract for a profit. In this process, no goods and services were moved and I didn’t care about the actual coffee beans, but capital was still generated. This example with coffee beans, which can be loosely applied to housing, shows how modern capitalism creates wealth not by trade or increasing production, but from other wealth. As a result, the wealth generated is disconnected from real world value.</p><p>Moreover, this system privileges financial institutions and banks over the people they serve. In regards to housing, banks exploit the need of the socio-economically disempowered for security by offering them loans at high interest rates. Consider Chicago resident Ida Mae Whitley, whose story is told in The Washington Post. At 62, she wanted to buy a nice house to retire in and so she was seduced by banks to take a high interest loan. Ultimately, she was put at risk to lose her home and lower her credit score because she couldn’t meet her monthly payments, hindering her ability to get more loans. Therefore, the financial system does not trickle down wealth but rather accumulates it at the top. The poor go further into debt and spend their spare money to pay down already lucrative borrowers, who use it to generate more wealth through capital gains.</p><p>No wonder the bottom 80 percent of Americans have only seven percent of the United States’s wealth. Despite this problem, proponents of capitalism suggest that the current system, which seeks wealth first, is the best possible way to lift people out of poverty and provide for their basic needs. At worst, the socially and economically disempowered, left behind by our economic system, are given welfare in the hope that the pocket change they receive can make up for the emotional damage that comes with being out of work and being unable to reintegrate into the workforce.</p><p>If we are to change our economic system, we must base it on a fundamentally different view of human nature. In line with the moral framework I proposed in “The Good Life,” I forward that the economy is not an end in itself but rather a means to an end, which is to help humans live virtuous lives. Therefore, economic transactions should be a reciprocal agreement about a shared goal of uplifting others between the parties.</p><p>Under this model, corporations have a social responsibility to their community and employees. This responsibility would take the form of a legal requirement that each company have a mission statement of long-term economic and social benefit to its community. A contemporary example of this is the British grocery retailer Tesco. The company cut the sugar content of all of its U.K. soft drinks by 20 percent from 2011 to 2016. The company is also a founder member of the World Cocoa Foundation and World Banana Forum, which exist to raise labor standards. With companies like Tesco, investors should be long-term holders who are committed to the company’s mission, instead of short-term shareholders who solely invest for profit.</p><p>Moreover, this model ties the lending of money to material investment: for instance,  by viewing debt in more relational terms in which profit and risk are shared by the lender and borrower. That is, borrowers would be stakeholders in the enterprises they invest in. One way of accomplishing this is to convert debt, which raises money by borrowing it and then repaying it, into equity, which raises money by selling portions of an asset. For example, if a family wants to buy a house, they take out a loan with a certain amount of interest from the bank, requiring them to pay back a portion every month. An equity-based model would have the family take out a mortgage in which the banks become part-owners. Every month the family would pay the bank a small rental fee to live in the property and then periodically buy part of the house owned by the bank. The bank now has a stake in the family’s well-being and the well-being of the community because its success is tied directly the community’s success. Moreover, the family has a lower risk of personal bankruptcy and repossession, which is economically costly and socially traumatic. Similar programs can be extended into consumer loans and commercial real estate.</p><p>We should also encourage the use of credit unions, which are banks in which the depositors are members and owners. First, since the members are owners, the bank is tied to the community, giving it a higher chance of investing in beneficial entreprises. Second, credit unions provide competitive interest rates and a broad range or loans and savings programs. Providing tax breaks and privileged access to credit to these banks would further encourage a system which prioritizes saving over debt-financing and fosters civil enterprises for the good of the community.</p><p>Furthermore, we need to prevent growing wealth inequality by encouraging a better distribution of capital between firms and employees. This includes encouraging employee stock ownership plans, which provide a layer of security and strengthen the bond between employee and employer. Second, this model means instituting a living wage at the national level and creating a system to negotiate family wages in varying locations. Workers would be less likely  to go into debt to finance expenditures, which increases consumer spending and in turn tax revenues. These revenues can be used to lower income taxes across the board  and provide tax benefits for small businesses.</p><p>Finally, higher wages and the wider distribution of capital should be complemented with a holistic education system that professionalizes the labor force. This can be accomplished through creating pathways of learning that fuse class-learning with vocational training for professions. Moreover, providing apprenticeships for various fields can create high-skilled and adaptable workers. Germany has a system similar to this model, in which apprenticeships are split between class instruction and training. For example, salesmen learn retail trade and management, construction workers learn civil engineering, and truck drivers learn logistics. In this way, workers have professionalized skills which are also adaptable to a wide range of careers.</p><p>The idea is that the goal of the economy is to serve society by strengthening social bonds, generating trust, and provide meaningful work. This is not to completely disavow the market system; rather, a moral society needs a moral economy that teaches us not to make money at the expense of others but rather teaches us to love, trust, care, and respect each other.</p>	Article	343	2017-12-24 16:45:29.003498	2017-12-24 16:45:29.003498
946	﻿Oh, the Places We’ll Go: The Two-Way Street of College Applications  <p>Four years of our lives boil down to four pages: the college application. We spend high school chasing college acceptance, obsessively competing with our friends for grades, leadership positions, and a seat at an elite university. We pour countless hours into perfecting how we look on paper rather than focusing on what we can learn from our high school experience.</p><p>Senior year comes with a mountain of stress and expectations; at Stuyvesant, everything is about the Ivy Leagues, and not getting into a dream school feels like a kick in the guts. Many students tend to self-deprecate when they are rejected even though they may have been perfectly qualified for the school. Yet, we have been taught that subjecting ourselves to this is a rite of passage.</p><p>With severely understaffed college and guidance offices, students find themselves stuck with these negative mentalities and without a proper support system.</p><p>To deal with thousands of students, the college and guidance offices look to the most efficient solution: mass emails. These emails are addressed to both parents and students, discussing what seem like the most important part of our adolescent lives. Though they attempt to expand college options beyond the famed Ivy League schools and reassure students, many of us feel that we have to go through this arduous process alone.</p><p>Despite certain resources, a relationship experienced over a computer screen cannot compare to a more meaningful, in-person relationship, in which a student can feel more supported through the often tiring and confusing college process.</p><p>Additionally, while there is an SSR meeting set up for each junior with his or her guidance counselor for the student to discuss the process, oftentimes, the guidance counselor does not reach out beyond the SSR meeting. Students will only receive support if they take the initiative to seek it out.</p><p>It is no doubt an overwhelmingly difficult task to advocate for yourself when you don’t know where to start. At 17, we may find ourselves scrambling for answers when there is no one to but us to teach our immigrant parents how to be what we need.</p><p>As of now, college counselors introduce juniors to the process with only an informative assembly during an English class and a thirty-minute private meeting with the student and his or her parents — not enough to provide serious, detailed answers.</p><p>Despite being a Title I school, the guidance office only glosses over financial aid opportunities. "It would be cool to get information about direct loans or scholarship programs so people who are making a tough decision have as much help as they can get," senior Shaik Abiden said.</p><p>The blame doesn’t fall solely on the shoulders of the college and guidance offices, since they are forced to deal with inadequate resources. In response, many students resort to facebook groups, which consist of recent Stuyvesant graduates and seniors giving anecdotal advice. However, those giving advice are generally students who have been accepted into elite schools; at times, they provide misinformation and cannot advise the general population.</p><p>Even after they have submitted their college applications, seniors face numerous problems, particularly after results are released. Aside from an email sent out to students about facing rejection, the college office does not directly reach out to students.Though receiving rejections from colleges can be a huge emotional blow, many students feel too estranged from the college and guidance offices to seek emotional support. On the bright side, it is made clear that the college and guidance offices have open doors.</p><p>Accepted students face problems as well, and many don’t understand the importance of choosing among financial packages. Seniors tend to receive limited help in deciding which school is the right fit for them, both academically and financially.</p><p>The first step to improving the college process is to communicate more closely with students and their families. The school could make automated phone calls and alert students about what they need to do for the college process and notify parents about upcoming college workshops. There also needs to be clearer support in both financial aid and mental health.</p><p>But ultimately, in a school of about 3,000 students, where guidance counselors have to write SSRs for over 100 students, it is up to us to take the initiative and reach out to guidance. We should be making sure that our counselors know who we are and develop a healthy relationship with our advisors—not just because they will be able to write better recommendations, but because we will also have an easier time finding much-needed insight. The college process should be a two-way street.</p><p>Four years of our lives do not boil down to four pages; we should not treat high school like an extended college interview. It shouldn’t be a burden or a source of anxiety — it should be a dynamic journey.</p>	Article	344	2017-12-24 16:45:52.919263	2017-12-24 16:45:52.919263
948	﻿The Issue of Masculinity in Disney Princes Disney princes have mainly been the same stereotypical muscular guys who go on to rescue the princess, which is not a good inspiration for young boys watching them. <p>Growing up, I’d always love watching “Mulan,” not just because the soundtrack was incredibly addicting to sing along with, but also because there was finally a movie with people of my race. But I never felt much of a connection between myself and the male lead, Li Shang, a tall, handsome military leader who trains soldiers; I am a short kid who can barely get through Ms. Rosenthal’s laps around the gym.</p><p>Another one of my favorite films was “Hercules,” but again, I was never really able to relate to Hercules. Slaying the Hydra, fighting titans, and saving Meg—all awe-inspiring feats and surely nothing I could do. How could I, a mere scrawny mortal, see myself in the shoes of such a strong, muscular, and celebrated hero?</p><p>Over time, Disney’s princesses have progressively become more developed and independent, breaking away from the original “damsel-in-distress” trope. The classic Aurora from “Sleeping Beauty,” who is asleep for the majority of the film and is only saved by her Prince Philip, seems more like a supporting character and plot device in her own film; a more recent character, Moana, saves her tribe and encourages them to become more adventurous while never depending on a man. But on the opposite end of the spectrum, most of Disney’s princes have remained the same “heroes-to-the-rescue,” from Li Shang to Aladdin to John Smith. Despite having their fair share of more gentle and romantic moments, such as Aladdin’s talk with Genie about his crush on Jasmine or John Smith being taught by Pocahontas about the wonders of nature, these characters ultimately remain the macho men.</p><p>The problem with this two-dimensionality in male characters is that many boys feel that the only suitable role they can fit is the dependable buff guy who has a weak girl depending on him. For example, in one of the songs from “Mulan,” “A Girl Worth Fighting For,” the soldiers sing about their ideal women. When Mulan says she would prefer women to be smart and outspoken, she is rejected by the other men, who sing about beautiful girls who would admire them for their strength, which influences younger audiences into believing that the only girls worth loving are the beautiful ones, and the only way to attract them is by showing off sheer dominance and masculinity—the exact opposite message Disney is trying to teach.</p><p>In addition, those few male characters with passive personalities or more effeminate appearances tend to be minor comical characters or villains, such as Merida’s boisterous father from “Brave” or the tall and slender Jafar from “Aladdin.” As a result, boys are not taught that it is okay to be themselves if they are just kind-hearted or fun-loving, but rather, to be stoic men whose worth are defined by muscle size. They are only taught to suppress their emotions, to make women depend on them, and to “man up.”</p><p>The origins of this issue stem from commonly defined gender roles in which men are expected to be the dominant, assertive voice and head of the household, whereas women are expected to be more submissive and simply do housework. For instance, in certain conservative sects of Christianity, women are still expected to not work, be obedient to their husbands, and are prohibited from serving as priests, popes, etc. Although the gender division in modern society has recently been blurred, men and women are still not equal.</p><p>Fortunately, some of the most recent Disney princes have strayed from the stereotypical “tough guy” image. Take Prince Naveen from “The Princess and the Frog.” While he is still an average, handsome romantic, he also depicts less masculine traits, such as naivete and clumsiness, causing his female counterpart Tiana to arguably be the more dominant character of the two. And despite not technically being considered a “Disney prince,” Kristoff from “Frozen” also demonstrates his kind-hearted, sensitive nature, and he ultimately does not play the “hero-to-the-rescue” as many of his predecessors have. Most recently, Maui from “Moana” plays the role of Moana’s friend and sidekick rather than Moana’s savior over the course of the film. As a result, young boys who watch future Disney movies will hopefully have a larger variety of role models who should inspire them to be less macho and more caring.</p>	Article	346	2017-12-24 16:47:33.512025	2017-12-24 16:47:33.512025

1011	﻿Snooping in the Lab Gone Wrong: Students Find Santa’s Reindeer Hidden Away One of Santa’s beloved reindeer was found in a lab room and the students were absolutely shaken, proceeding to come up with a ridiculous but somehow plausible conspiracy theory. <p>The biology department has seemingly gotten bored of frogs and moved on to new victims. Last week, several students, including sophomore Richard Kim, began exploring the lab rooms. The students picked the lock to a room using a paperclip and entered for purely innocent reasons. Upon first glance, everything seemed ordinary. After a careful search involving the throwing of boxes, they found a package labeled “FRAGILE—LIVE ANIMAL.” What they found inside was absolutely shocking.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” said Kim. “I thought it was just one of the many whale specimens the department keeps stowed away, until I noticed that signature red nose. It was Rudolph!” The other students confirmed that the biology department had in fact, managed to get their hands on one of Santa’s precious reindeer and performed a dissection. The reason for the biology department’s possession of this famous animal is unknown, but some students think they know the answer.</p><p>“It all makes sense now,” Kim said. “Obviously, Santa can’t deliver any of his presents without them.It was all a plot to make sure we would spend our entire break writing 2500 word essays about the mating patterns of Cucumis Sativus instead of being festive and opening Christmas presents. As for the dissection, that’s just the biology department being the biology department.”</p><p>The students had a funeral for the poor reindeer, burning a pyre in Battery Park. However, the occurrence only brings up the question of what else the biology department has in store. According to Kim, it is hypothesized that the department could even kidnap Santa Claus or genetically manufacture a Grinch. The biology department will be under scrutiny during the following weeks by the Student Union, which has realized their Christmas tree and future celebrations may fall under threat.</p>	Article	409	2018-01-23 02:56:35.206905	2018-01-23 02:56:35.206905
1013	﻿“Administration Enforces Sleep”  <p>Despite the recent 10-day break, students were returning to school feeling drowsy. With over 98.7 percent of students sleeping in class, many teachers got fed up and were left unable to teach their classes.</p><p>“I’ve literally never seen anything like this,” geometry teacher David Peng said.</p><p>“When I randomly wake someone up, it’s like they’ve forgotten what a proof is. This has gotten so out of hand that I had to reteach them what a triangle is.”</p><p>Seeing the administration’s growing desperation to solve this problem, freshman Emma Tong came up with a plan that she believed would benefit thousands of students in Stuyvesant.</p><p>A few days later, Tong decided to talk to Principal Eric Contreras about her plan. Though skeptical at first, Contreras grew increasingly interested in the plan over time.</p><p>“It’s actually quite genius, you know,” Contreras remarked. “All we have to do is enforce eight hours of sleep a night, and all of our problems will be solved. The students will love us for giving them so much sleep, and the school can finally resume the plan of brainwashing them. We’ll just dock half a point off their overall average if they sleep for less than eight hours. That would scare them silly. Eventually, we’ll have well-rested and energetic students for the first time in Stuyvesant’s history. It’s perfect!”</p><p>Despite mandating all students to get a healthy amount of sleep, this did not have the desired effect that the administration had initially hoped for. The policy has had no lasting effect thus far due to the difficulty of enforcing it and was quickly met by negative feedback from students and teachers alike.</p><p>“Not only have my grades suffered, but it’s basically impossible to get eight hours of sleep considering the amount of time that we spend on Facebook,” sophomore Ruby Huang said.</p><p>“I have no idea what the staff was doing when it implemented this policy,” Algebra 2 teacher Aziz Jumash said. “The kids are supposed to cry over their impossible homework every night, not sleep.”</p><p>Though the policy continues to get all sorts of negative feedback, the administration will continue attempting to enforce sleep until every Stuyvesant student can function in class again.</p>	Article	411	2018-01-23 02:57:22.176341	2018-01-23 02:57:22.176341
1024	﻿Despite Challenges, Pirates Dominate Early On Briefly discussing the Pirates’ successes and shortcoming in recent years while focusing on key areas that affect their chances at another championship run. <p>Sophomore Kai Yamamoto stepped up to his lane. He sprung off the starting block, already ahead of his competitors. It was a routine two laps for Yamamoto, who finished four seconds ahead of his teammate, freshman Karl Chen, and almost 10 seconds ahead of the fourth place competitor from James Monroe Campus. Yamamoto’s success in the 100-yard butterfly was one of many from Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity swimming & diving team, the Pirates, who extended a lengthy streak of regular season victories with a decisive 52-38 win over Campus on January 10.</p><p>These kinds of victories are nothing new for the Pirates, who have commanded the Bronx/Manhattan League for years now, with the last three seasons providing a combined regular season record of 23-0. Their divisional dominance also spills into their playoff performances: a championship run coming last year and losses in the championship rounds the two years before that. Both of these losses were to the Brooklyn Technical High School Engineers, which has resulted in a developing rivalry between the two teams. Many of the swimmers who were on the team two or three years ago are eager to once again compete with their rivals. “I remember losing to Brooklyn Tech my freshman year and how hard it was for the seniors to lose four times in a row. After that the whole team, even the rookies, [has] been extremely motivated. And while we still have this rivalry with Brooklyn Tech, we are confident we can [and] will win the championship this year,” junior Axel Tolpina said. This motivation has clearly paid off, as demonstrated by last year’s championship.</p><p>The Pirates hope to defend their title this year, but they have to compensate for the missing talent of last year’s seniors. This year, there are only five seniors and 13 underclassmen. Nonetheless, the team has faith in many of its underclassmen. Freshman Osmond Wan and Yamamoto have been very consistent this season, placing first or second in almost every event they’ve swam in, including the 100-yard freestyle and the 200-yard individual medley. “All of our new recruits this year have an overall great work ethic, which shows in their performance during practices and at meets. Yamamoto continues to put out fast times and win his events in our dual meets,” senior and co-captain Derek Tran said.</p><p>The upperclassmen core has also remained very solid, with co-captain seniors Derek Tran and Leon Lai as well as junior Nicholas Wen placing first in almost every event they’ve swam in this season, from the 200-yard individual medley to the 100-yard butterfly.</p><p>Another obstacle has been a coaching change. Coach Silvana Choy took over the role of former girls and boys swimming coach Peter Bologna, as a result of his new position as Stuyvesant’s Athletic Director. This was a very sudden and unexpected adjustment for the Pirates, who have seen deep playoff runs year after year thanks to former coach Bologna. “The biggest change [has been] our new head coach, Coach Choy. She took the position without prior knowledge about our swimmers, and we also did not know what to expect heading into this season. Throughout the first few weeks, we had to earn each other's trust and respect. She definitely runs things differently than former Coach Bologna, but they are both equally committed to this team. Even during this transition, we've still been able to remain a tight-knit community, and we fully trust Coach Choy,” Tran said.</p><p>A coaching transition is always something that can be a major factor in a team’s success, but the Pirates have stayed true to their dominance over the Bronx/Manhattan League under Coach Choy. So far, the Pirates have once again maintained an undefeated regular season record of 6-0 and look to clinch back-to-back championships by relying on their strong upperclassmen core and rapidly developing underclassmen roster.</p>	Article	422	2018-01-23 03:02:10.995075	2018-01-23 03:02:10.995075
1027	﻿Mandatory Volunteerism: Not an Oxymoron  <p>They say we are young people who are learning to think like adults. We haul ourselves out of bed at six in the morning every weekend and clumsily throw on our suits and polish our dress shoes. We are expected to use our “gifted tongues” to discuss how to create stability and foster citizenship in the seemingly messy world we live in today.</p><p>As high school debaters, we come equipped to each tournament ready to comment on our “constituents” in developing nations and our plan to fix the “socioeconomic instability” that we witness daily. We absorb the praise that is thrown at us by our teachers, coaches, and tournament directors for doing so.</p><p>Yet, it has become clear that our service only exists when it means we can take home another trophy to display. Often, we, the ones with the “gifted tongues,” ignore the homeless man we see every day begging for food, or the underprivileged students being forced to learn in run-down schools. We have become accustomed to viewing ourselves on a moral high ground, while not fully understanding what it means to take action.</p><p>In some areas of the United States, volunteering is now becoming a graduation requirement. According to Reason Magazine, mandatory volunteerism trains students to notice community problems, analyze them, and then take part in resolving them. This teaches students that it isn’t only their responsibility to comment on the issues that surround them, but also to play an active role in improving the lives of those who face these issues.</p><p>If educators hope to raise a generation of selfless, responsible, and active citizens who are genuinely committed to servicing their communities, they will need to emphasize the importance of interactions between volunteers and those they help.</p><p>Many critics of compulsory volunteerism cite studies that examine the insincere intentions of participants. These critics maintain that only those who want to volunteer should be doing so. Yet, even without these requirements, many students volunteer for the mere purpose of checking off a box on their college applications; in other words, this is a problem that already exists, not a problem that will be born as a result of mandatory volunteerism.</p><p>Under a mandate, the practices of college-driven students, as well as the practices of students who volunteer because they simply want to give back, will remain relatively unaffected. On the other hand, students who would not have otherwise become involved in community service will be exposed to the social and educational benefits of volunteering.</p><p>Moreover, mandatory volunteering can be a means by which participants can positively change their own attitudes. According to a National Longitudinal Study of Youth, volunteering has shown to be effective in discouraging students from participating in illicit activities, because it occupies their time productively.</p><p>By making volunteerism a graduation requirement, educators are taking the first step towards fostering citizenship among students. Maybe one day, we can possess more than “gifted tongues,” and can turn abstract ideas into concrete actions.</p>	Article	425	2018-01-23 22:25:05.659495	2018-01-23 22:25:05.659495
851	﻿The College Applications Feedback Loop  <p>College is baked into the Stuyvesant culture from students’ first steps into the building. In the freshman survey conducted by The Spectator, almost 70 percent of freshmen predicted they will attend an elite college (Ivy League, Stanford, etc.). Perhaps the drive comes naturally from the types of hard-working, academically motivated students that Stuyvesant attracts. As well, a majority of students come from Asian and Eastern European backgrounds, where parents place immense academic pressure on their children to attend a top-notch university.</p><p>To make matters worse, the administration does little to create a holistic environment. In a school such as Stuyvesant with a reputation for high-achieving students, GPA becomes many students’ defining factor, determining their eligibility for AP classes and role in the Stuyvesant community (ARISTA, Big Sib etc.). Every student is tasked with upholding the “Stuyvesant standard” of attending an elite university, when in reality success is determined by more than the reputation of your college. The result is a positive feedback loop of anxiety and competition, with everyone having a tunnel vision of educational success focused on college.</p><p><b>Mentality of Utility</b></p><p>Against the intense pressures of college applications, many seniors try to use the Early Decision and Action processes as strategically as possible. Strategizing encourages seniors to apply early to prestigious colleges they feel more likely to be accepted by, but that may not be the best fit for them. The mentality at Stuyvesant is that students will be happiest at the most prestigious college possible, whereas applying Early Action or Early Decision should actually be a decision made out of a passion for the school itself.</p><p>Asian and Eastern European parents reinforce this mentality by placing emphasis on their conception of an elite school, namely the Ivy Leagues. Some students are also unable to visit the campuses of every university, and as a result apply to well-known names based on brand and their parents’ influence, rather than finding a university that fulfills their aspirations.</p><p>The advice given is to emphasize aspects of yourself that differentiate you from the majority of the student body at that school. You might apply early to MIT, because as a humanities-focused student, you stand out against other Stuyvesant applicants. Or you might apply early to the University of Chicago even if it’s not your top school, so that you can have it as your “backup” when you apply to an Ivy League later.</p><p>However, strategizing may not be solely the result of the overly competitive nature of Stuyvesant. The college admissions system encourages this type of approach just as much as our classmates and college counselors do. Far from being a truly egalitarian system, colleges employ an opaque rubric that encourages students to try to out-smart.</p><p>This emphasis on gaming the system undermines the entire purpose of the college application process. By viewing college admissions as something to be conquered, students often sacrifice the chance to gain admission to the school or program that best suits them.</p><p>Furthermore, because seniors’ applications are directly compared with those of their peers, they feel pitted against each other to the point where every classmate is a direct threat. The quality of a college application becomes completely relative so that students are fixated on their peers’ applications instead of their own. It has come to the point where students make lists detailing who is applying to the same colleges so that they can scope out their competition and make personal decisions based on their perceived chances of gaining acceptance. Other students will hesitate to let their friends edit their essays, fearing that they will purposely make unhelpful or damaging comments in order to gain an advantage themselves. And the seniors who do get into their schools early and then choose to submit more applications by the regular deadline will often receive backlash from other students who feel that they are “stealing” their spots.</p><p><b>Breaking the Loop</b></p><p>Stuyvesant students will always be focused on getting a leg up in the college admissions process. However, it is important that students make an effort to stop the positive feedback loop through which the frenzy of college-based conversations and decisions encourages even more anxiety.</p><p>College admissions are not a zero-sum game: if someone gets into one of your top choices, you don’t lose out. Your admission doesn’t come at someone else’s expense, and colleges are balancing their student body based on the whole applicant pool, not just the applicants from Stuyvesant. The paranoia surrounding how others are doing and where they are applying is, in the end, just paranoia.</p><p>When top-tier colleges can easily fill a second class with equally qualified applicants, the candidates who are accepted are determined by somewhat unknown qualities, or by luck. Much of the application components that colleges assess in their admissions decisions—GPA, standardized test scores, and letters of recommendation—are out of your and your peers’ control by senior year. The best strategy is to simply focus on making the remaining aspects of your application the best they can be, rather than being distracted by your classmates. Strategizing and obsessing over how others are doing in the process will do nothing for you.</p>	Article	249	2017-12-01 20:32:04.799678	2017-12-01 20:32:04.799678
949	﻿ICP Review: Perpetual Revolution A review of ICP’s new exhibit <p>Many of the people of our generation are painfully unaware of important current events, both domestic and international. Though there are many factors that contribute to this, one problem is that there is no engaging way to get the younger generation invested in these important problems. Most of the news that people consume on a daily basis isn’t all that interesting. It tends to go in one ear and out the other. However, the “Perpetual Revolution: Image and Social Change” exhibit at the International Center of Photography is something completely different. It will leave you feeling completely “shook,” using powerful imagery to bring some of the world’s most glaring problems to life.</p><p>The International Center of Photography is renowned as one of the leading centers for photography and features exhibits that demonstrate the power that photos and videos have in shaping the modern world. “Perpetual Revolution: The Image and Social Change,” curated by Carol Squiers and Cynthia Young, opened on January 27, 2017, and will run until May 7. Tickets are $10 for students, and it is located at 250 Bowery in Manhattan.</p><p>The scope of this exhibit is so large that it almost seems impossible to grasp upon first glance. It covers some incredibly important and pressing issues of the modern age: climate change, the refugee crisis, LGBTQ+ representation/treatment, #blacklivesmatter, islamophobia, and the far-right fringe. This incredibly diverse range of topics gives the viewer a sense of overload which only adds to the emotional and intellectual gravitas of the exhibit. However, the sheer volume also impairs the viewer’s capability of ingesting and retaining all of the incredible work that is deserving of his or her full attention.</p><p>After you buy your ticket ($10 not wasted), you open the door and are greeted with a large wall filled with text. This concise, well-written introduction to the entire exhibit describes the importance of truth (or lack thereof) in the modern age and unpacks what it means to be “correct,” especially in a world with “alternative facts” and “post-truth-ism.”</p><p>The room is rather dim and cool, and it seems a bit cold and detached, rather than being warm and inviting. This visual aesthetic works to the exhibit’s advantage, however, as it emphasizes the gravity of the topics discussed and leaves no time to be comfortable with these situations.</p><p>One of the central parts of the exhibits pertains to the refugee crisis. This section of the exhibit is one of the most diverse in terms of media. The centerpiece of this section is a table with some white sand on top of it. It seems very strange at first, but when you see the projector displaying powerful images of the refugee crisis onto the sand, it starts to make sense. You can manipulate the sand in whatever way you’d like to distort the images projected on it. It highlights the fact that refugees are everyday people who led normal lives prior to their displacement. This piece shows the magnitude and spread of the crisis and how it affects so many people around the world. The moldable sand is very symbolic of the fact that we have the power to mold and shape our own world.</p><p>The photography of this section is magnificent and the tension and pain that is captured is stunning. Each picture encapsulates so much action: the rawest and purest forms of human emotion. There is also an e-book available to read as part of the exhibit, along with a slideshow of five incredible photos broken up into nine panels. Although all of the different media make the exhibit seem a bit scattered, it works brilliantly, with everything linking together and the concepts cohesive and powerful.</p><p>As you walk downstairs, you enter the section on LGBTQ+ treatment and representation. This section of the exhibit is almost completely dominated by screens, which is one of the few things that I am not a fan of. The number of screens makes it a bit too much to take in.</p><p>Screenshots of activism on social media, old music videos, pictures of the LGBTQ+ community before their rights were granted, and modern day examples of the community being ostracized dominate this section, and to great effect. The differences in time period serve as a critical reminder to the public that despite the progress that has been made, there is still so much work to be done and still so many parallels between the past and the present in terms of the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community. This section is also a lot more free-flowing than the rest of the exhibit. This part of the exhibit is very “loud” as it is plainly sexual, and it moves in a much less somber manner.</p><p>The most powerful and well crafted part of this exhibit pertains to #blacklivesmatter. The room is painted completely black and is dimly lit, with one wall used as a screen for two incredible collections of footage. One side of the wall displays photographs of the black community of the USA from all different time periods. These pictures are full of striking juxtapositions that make them shine as proof of the struggles the black community has faced.</p><p>The videos shown on the wall are simply amazing. They are composed of both footage from protests and politically charged pop culture. The way that these videos are put together is astonishing. The videos link seamlessly, all circling back to the central point of the struggles faced by the black community. The issues that it addresses are disheartening, yet also empowering. The way the story is told makes you want to do something to make a difference. There was no holding back in the creation of this much needed wake up call.</p><p>The last, and perhaps the least expected section of this exhibit, discusses the far-right fringe, in a very peculiar, yet effective way. How do they tell us about the horrors of these neo-Nazi, fascist edgelords? Through memes. The memes are all related to downplaying liberalism and how “politically correct” people need to be “gassed,” all the while laced with plenty of expletives. It’s an unconventional way to communicate such serious and scary ideas, but it works brilliantly, as memes are something that almost all can relate to, and seeing them used in such a politically charged way really demonstrates a new age of poking fun at the unlaughable.</p><p>After viewing this entire exhibit, you’ll feel a bit tired. You’ll also feel a bit scared for the world. But perhaps most importantly, you will feel hopeful. Hopeful at the fact that people took the time out of their lives to put together such a vast, powerful exhibit to educate others about the horrors of the world and what we can do to respect and change them. And hopeful because people take the time out of their lives to visit and appreciate it. The technique that is used here, throwing everything at the viewer so it feels inescapable, almost suffering, is used to great effect here.</p><p>Especially in a time of great political tension, everyone deserves to be, and needs to be, updated when it comes to current events. With politics becoming more and more relevant in our daily lives and as young people who will eventually inherit this earth, it is our responsibility to not turn a blind eye to the current state of affairs. Young people must take these important matters into their own hands and educate themselves about the world that they will be responsible for.</p>	Article	347	2017-12-24 16:48:18.078007	2017-12-24 16:48:18.078007
951	﻿Fitter, Happier, More Innovative…  The Legacy of Radiohead’s “OK Computer”  <p>Albums such as Radiohead’s landmark “OK Computer” (1997), which celebrates its 20th anniversary this May, are released only once in a generation. “OK Computer” challenged listeners to consider popular music not merely as a form of entertainment, but more importantly as a culturally relevant medium of art and philosophy. Its most definitive aspect is its driving pathos, which appeals to the deepest emotions of the listener and forces the audience to reconsider the nature of the world that we live in.</p><p>While “OK Computer” is remembered 20 years after its release for its relevant themes and prophetic social commentaries, it shook the music industry at the time with its maverick spirit—its defiance of the music industry’s norms and ventures into uncharted territories.</p><p>“OK Computer” was a notable departure from the ‘90s alternative rock scene spearheaded by the emergence of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Alice in Chains. Alternative rock of the ‘90s was “alternative” in the sense that it primarily embodied anger, violence, and self-destructive habits. It was also associated with sex, drugs, and alcohol, all of which represented a thrilling escape from a mundane livelihood and came to define the rebellious culture of Generation Y.</p><p>Radiohead first burst through mainstream commercial success with their hit single “Creep” (1991), which remains one of the band’s most well-known songs today. Their second album, “The Bends” (1995), was also well received by audiences. The vocal range of lead singer Thom Yorke and the dexterity of guitarist Jonny Greenwood gained recognition in the alternative rock community. However, their early works were thematically clichéd, simply structured, and driven by a minimalistic sound. Radiohead’s early works failed to break any new ground within an increasingly stale genre.</p><p>The band’s sudden transition into the experimental “OK Computer” was initially perceived by its producer and record label to be “commercial suicide” due to the album’s lack of radio-friendly tracks.WIth respect to “The Bends,” “OK Computer” was much more difficult for listeners to digest. It sacrificed marketability and appeal for the lowest common denominator through its often contradictory and dichotomous nature. It is simultaneously soothing and terrifying, balancing between chaos and calm.</p><p>Rather than appealing to an audience that readily consumed the agonized lyrics of Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley, Radiohead’s “OK Computer” took a different approach by striving to be unorthodox—musically, lyrically, and thematically.</p><p>“Karma Police” is a standout track that showcases the band’s unique brand of experimentation with sound. The somber piano chords and soft strumming of the background acoustic guitar harmonize to establish a deceptively lulling tone, which conceals the sinister themes of the song. Yorke’s distressed vocal timbres in the final verse, “For a minute there, I lost myself,” are accompanied by frantically paced piano segments. These combine to strike a particular chord with the listener by channeling the narrator’s torment into audible sounds. The source of this torment is the “karma police,” the namesake of the song’s title.</p><p>The leading single, “Paranoid Android,” is particularly notable for its rapid transitions between sharply contrasting sections and changes in key. The chorus, “What’s this? / (I may be paranoid but not an android),” is accompanied by multiple guitars and synths, adding on to Yorke’s extended vocal notes. The song builds up to a dizzying crescendo, culminating with Greenwood’s frantic guitar solo, and a sudden decrescendo into a dissonant verse. These transitions then leave the listener unsettled by Yorke’s anguished singing.</p><p>“Fitter Happier,” the album’s most anomalous track and most difficult listen, incorporates a computer text generated voice to paint a picture of an ideal society in the future. Dissonant and jarring piano chords have an unpleasant effect on the listener and accompany the computerized narrating voice, which lists in rapid succession unreasonable expectations for both personal and societal progress. Such expectations of the narrator include “Sleeping well, no bad dreams, no paranoia / No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows / Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate.”</p><p>The seemingly positive lyrics are instantly stripped of their deceptive facade as the song’s ominous and discomforting sound takes a more looming presence. The clashing piano, strings, and electronic instruments all convey an atmosphere of despair and false hope through irregular time signatures and asymmetric sections. The hidden overarching theme present in “Fitter Happier” is a society driven by consumerism and advertisements. Much of the song portrays an ideal lifestyle—a society preoccupied with “eating well,” “not drinking too much,” and “a safer car”—while being oblivious to the fact that there is “no chance of escape” from the rituals and routines they have been accustomed to.</p><p>In addition to exploring new realms of sound, the album also delves into several criticisms of modern society by depicting lives corroded by technology. The opening track “Airbag” is about a narrator surviving a car crash and walking out of the experience as a changed man: “In a fast German car / I’m amazed I survived / An airbag saved my life.” These lyrics emphasize the fragility of our lives which are at the mercy of technology, foreshadowing the unprecedented role that technology has in our lives today in the 21st century. The narrator also expresses a newfound thrill to be alive—an adrenaline rush from surviving a lifestyle of breakneck speed.</p><p>Shortly after the release of “OK Computer,” the music industry took off in a completely different direction, with many pop artists rising to the top of the BIllboard charts, only to fizzle a few weeks later. This profit-driven system of cashing in on the latest trends encouraged artists to release hot, catchy singles at the expense of taking the time to craft an entire album. The band members of Radiohead were pressed with a demanding deadline for “OK Computer,” and much of their frustration was voiced while creating the album. By the late ‘90s, the band witnessed the rapid rise of the World Wide Web, the advent of cellphones, and the increasing prevalence of mass media in everyday life.</p><p>Yorke attributes the fast-paced lifestyle depicted in “Airbag” to people’s diminishing attention span and need for instant gratification—the notion that faster is always better. In defiance, “OK Computer” was designed to be a lengthy hour-long album, devoid of pop friendly tracks and with little marketability. Radiohead was more intent on channeling their frustrations of modern society rather than appeasing their listeners. They were ultimately aware of the troubling direction that popular music was heading toward.</p><p>While the album encompasses a multitude of themes throughout, it is essentially a scathing commentary on human nature and its inherent ignorance. The narrator’s plea for self-validation in “Paranoid Android” (“You don’t remember / Why don’t you remember my name?”) expresses the crushing reality in which society has become a monolith that drives out any form of creativity and promotes dullness. The society depicted by “OK Computer” believes that “It’s always better when the light is off / It’s always better on the outside” (From the track “Climbing Up the Walls”).</p><p>“OK Computer” completely upended the definition of “alternative music” and delved into thematicism and experimentation like no other musicians have done before. The album’s insistent defiance of the music industry’s norms have set a new precedent for other artists across all different genres to follow. Ultimately, its intentions were to have a profound effect on the listeners and to both captivate and provoke them. Despite the troubling and perhaps prophetic depiction of modern society in the 21st century, the album reassures its listeners to “Breathe, keep breathing / Don’t lose your nerve” (From “Exit Music For a Film”).</p>	Article	349	2017-12-24 16:51:37.874065	2017-12-24 16:51:37.874065
952	﻿Drake Takes Diversity in Music to a New Level in “More Life” Drake dominates the music world once again, but this time in a subtler way with the release of a “playlist.” <p>Drake has always been one to impress his listeners with his genuine artistry in music. When he released his groundbreaking album, “Views,” in April of 2016, he set the music world into a frenzy. Less than a year later, Drake has stunned the music world again with his recent debut of “More Life.” This project, whose release has been awaited by his fans since its announcement on Drake’s birthday, features a lengthy total of 22 tracks and spans 81 minutes. Interestingly, rather than being officially called an album (like “Views”), Drake dubs “More Life” a playlist.</p><p>Though this has proved an unprecedented decision in music and confused many critics initially, the motives behind this tactic became a little clearer after listening to the entire album. Had “More Life” been called an album, the style would have been seen as all too similar to “Views,” but yet not nearly as good or fleshed out. Both span exactly 81 minutes long, are presented in a versatile style (predominantly hip-hop that mixes in pop and R&B), feature Drake singing about his past struggles, and exhibit his heavy usage of samples.</p><p>This distinction of a playlist is what allows critics and fans alike to take what Drake has produced more lightly. An album, especially if it is a Drake album, comes with the expectation of having only the most innovative and record-breaking tracks, something “More Life” unfortunately falls short on. However, for Drake, this playlist serves as a perfect intermediate between “Views” and his upcoming album, allowing his fan base to be occupied with more music.</p><p>Listening to the entire playlist for the first time in one full sitting, I wasn’t able to sense a strong artistic statement from Drake. It is on the passive side and feels too much under-the-radar. There are many diverse, beautiful, and unique ideas presented throughout this playlist, but this eclectic compilation of different styles is woven and developed in a fashion that prevents it from being as sonically cohesive as it could be.</p><p>Part of this lack of presence stems from the fact that he does not have a clear and direct direction that he wants to take with “More Life.” The first two tracks, “Free Smoke” and “No Long Talk,” both contain heavier beats to which Drake raps.</p><p>After the first two tracks, the playlist immediately goes into “Passionfruit,” a track that provides a surprisingly pleasant contrast and appears to be everybody’s favorite. “Passionfruit” features a deep Caribbean and Jamaican sound, consisting of a pulsating, dance-like rhythm that pervades the entirety of the song. It also uses modern synthesizers and other light percussion instruments to emulate the sound of a steelpan and to create a potent grooving sound, making the track truly enjoyable to listen to. The same style goes on for the next four tracks (“Jorja Interlude,” “Get it Together,” “Madiba Riddim,” and “Blem”) that tie together smoothly as they all contain a lighthearted, dancehall sound. After those four tracks, it progresses right back to hard-hitting music, such as rap and heavy hip-hop for the rest of the playlist.</p><p>Another indicator that Drake takes a backseat in this playlist is that he diverts a lot of the focus onto other singers. In one track titled “4422,” Drake’s vocals are not present at all. Instead, British singer Sampha takes on the spotlight. Sampha sings the entirety of the song, with his voice having a soft, layered chorus effect that helps create a poignant yet intimate feeling. “4422” has the slowest of all tempos on the track, allowing both Sampha’s voice and each element in the cool instrumentals to be distinctly heard and appreciated.</p><p>Drake is also out-sung in one of the most memorable tracks, “Glow,” a highly anticipated collaboration with another hip-hop icon, Kanye West. West takes on the main hook, opening up the song with singing, “Watch out for me / I’m about to glow.” He repeats that several times throughout the song. His dominating vocals are crisp and powerful, which provide the sole focus to this song. Drake does a fairly decent job of singing his verse in the second half, yet it does not match Kanye’s.</p><p>Moreover, the extensive use of samples in “More Life” should be viewed with ambivalence. On one hand, Drake has added many dimensions to this playlist with their clever use. In “Do Not Disturb,” Drake takes the soulful vocals of Snoh Aalegra in her ballad, “TIME,” speeds them up and loops them over and over, creating a beautiful background to set his rap in. Drake also samples songs of different genres from almost every decade in the past five decades. With this, he is truly able to convey a sense of diversity in music.</p><p>However, in “Teenage Fever,” he goes overboard with a sample of Jennifer Lopez. Drake takes the chorus of Jennifer Lopez’s “If You Had My Love” and sets it as his own chorus. Though it works and sounds well, it is a cheap and ingenuine tactic to produce a song.</p><p>The lyricality of this playlist is expected of Drake. He does not fail to deliver a heartfelt message about how far he has come since the beginning: the struggles and sacrifices he has made in his career, his widely-scrutinized romances, fame, and the relationships with the people around him. In “Glow,” we hear the iconic lyrics “Started from the bottom, now we here now,” which directly alludes to his song, “Started From the Bottom” released in 2012. These lyrics have become the epitome of Drake’s portrayal of himself as the underdog who overcame obstacles from his childhood and single-handedly became a success.</p><p>The quality of the instrumentals are a strong suit of this playlist. In many tracks such as “Ice Melts” and “Glow,” they feature subtle hints of trap layered with different kinds of drum beats, and one strong rhythm plays throughout.</p><p>An hour into listening to this playlist, it can feel as if it has dragged on for too long. It is a dense, unfocused album that shines more for its variety of voices and ideas. Yet, it’s definitely worth listening to at least once. Listening to these 22 tracks more and more frequently has made it grow on me, as I’ve gradually come to appreciate the diverse niceties that Drake has presented to the table. It’s not a perfect piece of work and is not Drake’s best by far. But as stated in the outro, until he comes “back in 2018 to give [us] a summary” in the form of  a new album, this playlist proves itself good enough to listen to meanwhile.</p>	Article	350	2017-12-24 16:53:02.443352	2017-12-24 16:53:02.443352
953	﻿With Little Mix, Maturity Equals Improvement  <p>Jesy Nelson, Jade Thirlwall, Perrie Edwards, and Leigh-Anne Pinnock came together to become the first girl group to ever win The X Factor in 2011. Four albums and many awards later, they have won over thousands of people with their raw talent, flawless harmonies, and endless charm.</p><p>However, an average fan would receive quite a shock when they listen to their most recent album, “Glory Days” (2016).</p><p>In their previous albums, they had shied away from mature topics, doing nothing more than dropping at most a few hints toward something more sexual. But in “Glory Days,” it is clear that Little Mix has taken into account their own maturation as artists, as well as the maturation of their intended demographic from teens to adults.</p><p>In “Glory Days,” Little Mix manages to infuse a variety of musical styles with a creativity exclusive to them alone, from sweet ballads to fun dance jams.</p><p>Their first released single of the album, “Shout Out To My Ex,” is meant to be uplifting and inspiring to those who still haven’t quite gotten over their past lovers breaking their hearts. The accented beats perfectly accentuate the confident lines, with each girl making sure to let the ex know he isn’t needed. Edwards even makes sure to include in her beginning verse an unexpected sassiness: “I hope she gettin’ better sex, hope she ain’t fakin’ it like I did.”</p><p>Although the placement of an acoustic guitar in such a beat-heavy song is odd, it’s precisely what the track needs to tie it all together. The guitar is the perfect accompaniment to the girls harmonizing over the chorus, with lyrics like, “I’m all the way up, I swear you’ll never bring me down.”</p><p>The sound of them singing together and the stripped-down feel we get from the guitar makes the tight bond and unity between all the girls clear, as they help each other rise above their previous breakups.</p><p>“Touch,” their second single, is a passionate declaration of love. It begins soft and slow, with nothing more than Pinnock’s sweet statements of love and a simple background melody. But once the beat drops, the song transforms. The strong beat and perfectly executed harmonies for the catchy chorus make it the perfect song to dance to.</p><p>It is implied that the “touch” of the love they’re receiving isn’t exactly a PG-13 kind of love. Edwards and Thirlwall’s lines include the lyrics, “Fingers on my buttons and now you’re playing, master of anticipation,” while Nelson makes it most evident with “Photograph with no t-shirt on, why you making me wait so long?” The girls knew singing of a more “adult” love would escalate their level of passion, and it just so happened to create the perfect dance song in the process.</p><p>Despite being a pop group, Little Mix successfully incorporates more old-fashioned musical aspects. “F.U.” provides a satisfying, pleasing-to-the-ear throwback to the ‘50s. The girls croon about how they can’t stay mad at their corrupt lover: “Had my break-up speech ready, then you kissed my face, it’s the way you persuade me.”</p><p>It starts off deceptively simple, with a rolling drumbeat and the bluesy strumming of a guitar. Nelson’s distinct, unique vibrato is perfect for introducing the song, followed up by Thirlwall infusing a little bit of grit into her usually smooth vocals.</p><p>They’re more subtle about sexual content here, but its presence is undeniable; when Pinnock belts out the lyrics, “I wish you were dead ‘til you take me to bed, you’re so good, so good,” it’s obvious as to what she’s singing about. Even so, the girls manage to use the perfect combination of a breezy beat and powerful vocals to truly get their message of conflicting feelings of love and hatred across.</p><p>Little Mix does phenomenally when it comes to ballads. “Nobody Like You” is their attempt—a successful one—to top their previous noteworthy ballad “Good Enough.”</p><p>It starts with Nelson accompanied by soft piano. Nelson tones down her rasp for this song in order to showcase more of her soulful vibrato, making her low notes sound raw and emotional. When she showcases her upper register in the second half of the chorus, she truly sounds like she’s almost on the verge of tears as she sings, “I’m screaming ‘I don’t want you’ but you know that I do.”</p><p>The rest of the girls follow up with an equally emotional performance. The piano is slowly joined by other instruments and an intensifying beat while the girls sing their hearts out over the pain inflicted on them after breaking up with someone they truly loved.</p><p>As they sing “I only like myself when I’m with you” and “All I want is to feel again,” instead of each member sounding like a teenager crying over young love, they sound like a woman mourning over a person she loved with all her heart.</p><p>Their most explicit track is definitely “Private Show.” Its heavy bassline and sharp brass notes give the song energy and electricity and make it nearly impossible to stop oneself from dancing along and lip-syncing with the girls.</p><p>Yes, it’s definitely a surprise as to how extreme some of their lyrics are. None of the girls hold back at the chorus, singing, “Who said we got to go slow, turn down the lights and watch my private show” and “To get high, we got to get low.” But it can’t be denied that this is definitely one of their boldest and best tracks to date.</p><p>“Glory Days” is a statement of how bold is better. Some may be put off by how much Little Mix has matured in the time span between their most recent album and this album, preferring their old sound in comparison.

From what we’ve heard, it’s clear that a lack of non-sexual content doesn’t correlate to a lack of quality for Little Mix.</p><p>“Glory Days” is only Little Mix’s transition to maturity. As they continue to “grow up,” their music will only continue to improve.</p>	Article	351	2017-12-24 16:53:46.169474	2017-12-24 16:53:46.169474
955	﻿Regina Spektor at Radio City Regina Spektor performed at Radio City Music Hall on March 11. <p>Regina Spektor walked onto the stage timidly and sat down at the piano bathed in blue light. After taking a sip of water, wiping her hands on her jeans, and clearing her throat, she began her first song, “On The Radio,” a funky but simple ballad about an unknown person. The entirety of Radio City Music Hall was silent, listening to her clear voice, crisp piano, and instrumental accompaniment bounce off the high ceilings. When she finished, the hall erupted in applause and she laughed, smiling widely.</p><p>Singer and songwriter Regina Spektor visited Radio City Music Hall on March 11, 2017, as a part of her tour, promoting her recent album “Remember Us to Life.”</p><p>Before the concert, viewers eagerly awaited Spektor’s arrival and chatted about their favorite Spektor songs, concerts they had already been to, and their expectations for the following concert. The lighting was bright, beaming onto the famous red curtains of the music hall and bouncing off of the high, layered ceiling onto the packed orchestra seating and crowded balconies. Though there were a few younger kids sprinkled throughout the audience, most of the crowd ranged from 30 to 50 years old.</p><p>Despite the age difference, I had great conversations with other audience members. The special thing about going to a concert, or any gathering of the sort, is being with people who share similar interests. A love for Spektor’s style—a mix of slow, soft songs with the occasional fast and lively song—brought everyone at the hall together and made for an easy conversation starter.</p><p>As the red curtains parted and gave way to the piano, Spektor walked on stage. She was incredibly nervous throughout her performance and even had to start over during one of her songs because she was so choked up. “I’m sorry—it’s just—Radio City Music Hall, you know?” she said before restarting “Grand Hotel,” this time with more power and confidence.</p><p>In another personal moment she shared with the audience, she called her mom while on stage. It was the first home show her mom hadn’t attended because of illness. She phoned her mom and had a short conversation, switching back and forth between her native Russian and learned English. Although in her 30s, at that moment, Spektor seemed like a much younger performer who needed her mother’s assurance. Afterwards, Spektor chuckled and said, “Wow, I thought that only happened in movies!”</p><p>Spektor’s alto voice sounded exactly the same as her recordings, strong and clear. Even songs that sound like there could be some autotune, like “Bleeding Heart,” sounded almost exactly the same, if not better. I stared, amazed at her talent, as her voice rang out. During some songs, her voice sounded quiet and soft, but in other songs, it was powerful and needed limited instrumental accompaniment. Not only does Spektor sing and write most of her own songs, she also plays the piano like a virtuoso, her hands skimming quickly over the keys.</p><p>She was accompanied by a few other musicians on the drums and the bass under multicolored strobe lights that changed pace depending on the tempo of the song. During the fast songs, like “Don’t Leave Me [Ne Me Quitte Pas],” the lighting was frantic, with rapidly changing colors and about 10 spotlights shining on Spektor. However, during slow songs, like “Sellers of Flowers,” the lighting was soft and simple, sometimes with just a single beam of light. The lighting helped emphasize the beats of the songs, which made the audience members get even more into singing or humming along.</p><p>The audience spent the entire show soaking up her beautiful lyrics and natural voice, her pleasant disposition, and funny moments. Listening to music through headphones can never beat the experience of seeing a performer in person and seeing the actual hard work and talent that goes into every song. After a night full of cheers, singing, and laughing, Radio City Music Hall was buzzing with praise for Regina Spektor.</p>	Article	353	2017-12-24 16:54:41.278791	2017-12-24 16:54:41.278791
957	﻿Freshmen Starting College Hunt Early  <p>Most freshmen tend to have no idea about college, let alone the college admissions process. Even some Stuyvesant seniors do not fully grasp the idea of college. “Wait, we graduate to go to school again? I thought college was just four years of sleeping to recuperate from Stuy,” senior Alec Dai quipped.</p><p>Exceptions always exist at Stuyvesant (like that complex seven class program change that took 273 parent phone calls), and this year, freshmen have begun to beat the juniors at the college game. They’re taking “starting early” to a new level.</p><p>1) College tours this year have significantly changed. Due to the increased number of freshmen attendees, upperclassmen attendance has severely waned, except for expert freshmen hunters. “The last college trip was packed with so many freshmen that I actually had to talk to them,” junior Jason Kao remarked. “At some college, a bunch of fratters called Stuyvesant the ‘school of the dwarves.’”</p><p>2) Have you wondered why your college counselor meetings are so late this year? It’s because freshmen have been barging into the college office and demanding a meeting with a college counselor. The demand has been so great that the college office now has a maitre d’, along with buzzers. These inquisitive freshmen have also arranged for alumni interviews and signed up for college e-mailing lists. Colleges are no longer comparing students to other students of the same age, deciding to accommodate freshmen in their admissions processes.</p><p>3) For the first time, teachers have began to write college recommendations for freshmen, diminishing the opportunities for juniors. “I’m only writing 15 junior recommendations because the freshman are just so much better at being juniors,” social studies teacher Victor Greez commented. “They’re actually awake in class.”</p><p>“I’d be willing to write for any freshman, even if I didn’t know who he or she was,” chemistry teacher Gabriel Ting expressed. “They are just so cute and perfect.” It’s not surprising that this year’s junior class slams the panic button when anything college-related is mentioned.</p><p>4) Many freshmen have started their own clubs: the “I Have Created This Club For College Interviews Club,” the “Northwestern Bay of Biscay Marine Biology Research Internship Prep Club,” and the “Insert Name Here Club” to name a few. These ambitious freshmen have overwhelmed the room booking system, causing general mayhem after school. To accommodate, the SU has opened up space in the elevator shafts, on the roof, and in the staircases.</p><p>5) Principal Eric Contreras has proposed a new change to the current grade levels. Freshmen who demonstrate college preparedness will be able to accelerate automatically to junior year and have access to coveted AP waivers. As a result, freshmen have begun to sell these AP waivers on the Stuyvesant Black Market, not that it exists...</p>	Article	355	2017-12-24 16:55:37.577743	2017-12-24 16:55:37.577743

962	﻿A Solid Start for the Huskies  <p>After having to miss multiple practices and four league games due to cold weather, the Huskies, Stuyvesant’s girls’ lacrosse team, began their season on March 27 against a KIPP NYC College Prep team. The girls were eager to finally start their season as they took charge of the field at Randall’s Island.</p><p>The delayed start to the season did not seem to phase the Huskies, as they were well-trained and seemed to be in midseason form right from the start. Led by senior and co-captain Lucy Wang, who finished the game with 12 goals on 14 shots, the Huskies maintained a substantial lead throughout the game, defeating KIPP with a score of 15-5.</p><p>The following game, the Huskies followed up with a solid 13-6 win over Frederick Douglass Academy in which Wang scored another eight goals on eight shots.</p><p>Though the Huskies got off to a quick start, they were faced with a 19-3 loss against Hunter. Though Wang scored two of the Huskies’ three goals, she felt that a lack of preparation combined with the incorrect mindset was their undoing. “A lot of it was bad mentality, if not from the rain, then from whatever. I think our biggest problem was catching. Our lack of practices shows in our passing, catching and ground balls,” Wang said.</p><p>The following game against Bronx Science saw a renewed effort by the team to try to defeat a longstanding rival.  Their vigor and determination led to a closely fought battle where Bronx Science came out on top by a close margin of 11-10.  Wang tacked on five more goals and continued to be an important presence on the field for the Huskies.</p><p>In their last game against Christopher Columbus Campus, the Huskies saw their hard work and practice pay off as they had a resounding 7-0 win.  Wang continued her tear as she scored five more goals, adding up to an impressive season total of 32 goals.</p><p>The Huskies had a different start to their season than last year’s team. Their 3-2 record, with one of the losses being the 11-10 against Bronx Science, is drastically different from their 1-4 start last season.</p><p>The team still managed to make the playoffs last season, but were eliminated in the first round.</p><p>Now, with a strong list of returning players, the team has been able to score wins right from the start. Wang has been a huge part of this initial success, scoring 32 goals on 41 attempts, ranking her first in all of PSAL in goals scored.</p><p>In addition to her individual success, she credits many of her teammates for improving this season. “Juniors Leila Storkamp and Inbar Pe'er have really stepped up and contributed to this start,” she said. The goal is clear among the team: playoffs or bust, and they have done their part to achieve this goal.</p>	Article	360	2017-12-24 16:57:45.909359	2017-12-24 16:57:45.909359
965	﻿Rocky Start Shows Pegleg Strength The Stuyvesant Peglegs have struggled to start their season but are proving they deserve a playoff spot. <p>Starting out the season with two losses, the Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ lacrosse team, were determined to come back strong to keep their playoff hopes alive. The Peglegs had lost to Albert Tuitt Educational Campus with a final score of 2-0 and Frederick Douglass Academy with a final score of 12-5.</p><p>After these losses, the team looked back at their play and realized the one key component they were lacking in was their offense. “Our defense has been very strong so far, but our offense really needs to take it to the next level. Our biggest problem is being aggressive and going for shots,” senior and co-captain Winston Venderbush said.</p><p>The Peglegs traced many of their early struggles to a heavy reliance on a few players. In the first two games of the season, senior and co-captain Michael Joh and senior Ledion Lecaj were the only players to score goals, combining for only five.</p><p>These losses were a wake up call. “We can never underestimate our opponents and must play every team as if they were the best,” Joh said.</p><p>Venderbush was shocked that the Peglegs lost their first two games. “I thought it was really winnable. We just came onto the field as a bunch of individuals rather than a team,” he said.</p><p>With these issues recognized, the Peglegs went on to win the next three games, scoring a combined 23 goals in these games, while only giving up five goals in return. “I think we definitely pulled together as a team more for the next [three] games and were able to win together. It's what we should have done,” said Venderbush.</p><p>The Peglegs beat Long Island City High School 10-2, Jamaica High School 4-2, and A. Philip Randolph Campus High School 9-1, with a total of eight different players scoring in those matches, including senior Enoch Lee, juniors Dmytro Hvirtsman and Sam Brimberg, and Venderbush.</p><p>With their season almost halfway over and their record at 3-2, the Peglegs will have to keep up their offensive aggressiveness in order to help their stellar defense and keep hopes of a deep playoff run alive.</p>	Article	363	2017-12-24 16:59:09.599192	2017-12-24 16:59:09.599192
966	﻿Dragons Dominate to Start Season The Stuyvesant Dragons, following a third round playoff exit last year, and consisting of an experienced, senior-heavy team, look for their first title. <p>Stuyvesant’s handball team, the Dragons, have been dominating their competition, winning all of their games by a 5-0 match sweep, giving them a 6-0 record.</p><p>Coming off a playoff exit last season, the Dragons are looking forward to going further in the playoffs and possibly bringing home a championship.</p><p>Last year was very promising, as in the prior two years, the Dragons were knocked off in second round exits.</p><p>The Dragons have been holding up well, even though last year’s leading seniors Kevin Chau (first singles, 35 total aces, 19 total kills, 7-5 singles record), Jonathan Yuan (third singles, 25 total aces, 9 total kills, 6-3 singles record), and Rahul Debnath (first doubles, 22 total aces, 5 total kills, 8-0 doubles record) have graduated.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Vincent Wu, who has been on the team for four years, is optimistic for what this season holds. “They [seniors who graduated] were pretty strong players, but I think it didn’t really hit our team too hard this year. Everyone else improved a lot, and we have good chemistry, as almost every starter is going to be a senior,” he said.</p><p>Both the doubles duos, senior Jasper Li and Wu and seniors Stanley Lee, Yongheng Zhou, and Daniel Chiu, have gotten perfect matches (winning the match 21-0), along with singles players senior James Young and senior Edwin Lee. Young and Lee lead the team with 33 aces in five matches, while senior Jonathan Shi lead the team with 12 kills in five matches.</p><p>Wu is very optimistic about this season and thinks the team is on track for a perfect season. “Everyone has played pretty well so far, and we already won [half] of our hardest matches in the league,” Wu said. “Hopefully, we’ll be able to leave behind a legacy for the handball team that future handball teams could follow.”</p>	Article	364	2017-12-24 16:59:17.964493	2017-12-24 16:59:17.964493

972	New York Times Columnist Addresses College Admissions Mania New York Times columnist visited school to talk about college admissions. <p>Frank Bruni, a columnist for The New York Times, visited Stuyvesant on Tuesday, March 3, from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Murray Khan Theater to speak about the growing belief that a student’s future starts and ends with an Ivy League education. The talk was organized by the Stuyvesant Parent’s Association and hosted by co-presidents David Venderbush and Lynn Chen During the lecture, Bruni used excerpts from his book “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be,” as well as anecdotes about successful men and women, to convey his belief that our society places too much emphasis on the college admissions process.</p><p>Bruni, a graduate of both the University of North Carolina and Columbia University, has worked in various positions for The New York Times and has written books about topics including cuisine and politics. “Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be” was released on March 15, 2015, and currently resides on The New York Times Best Sellers list in Hardcover Non- Fiction.</p><p>Bruni began his talk by reading an email he had received from a high school senior who was going through the college process at that time. The email showed an example of a student who felt a great amount of pressure about how the college she would attend would determine her life, introducing Bruni’s point that college is incorrectly perceived as a deciding factor in making or breaking someone’s entire career.</p><p>Bruni went on to say that the “system is broken” and asked the audience whether the process is helping or harming to a child. “We are sending an extremely dangerous message that once you get into a good college you're home free,” Bruni said in the lecture.</p><p>Bruni incorporated both statistics and stories about well-known people such as author John Green and Chief Executive Officer of Starbucks Howard Schultz, who exemplify the concept that it is possible to reach high levels of success in ways other than attending Ivy League universities.</p><p>One point mentioned was that a large number of people listed as MacArthur Genius Grant Award winners, a highly regarded competition for excellence in different academic backgrounds, attended colleges such as Louisiana State University and the University of Maryland, schools that are not as widely praised in the general media. These successful people were able to use their colleges to gain skills such as better communication and confidence that eventually led to more opportunities in their individual fields. These examples support Bruni’s assertion that the discourse surrounding college is incorrect. “We should not have conversations about how to get into college, but how to use college,” Bruni said.</p><p>Many parents found the lecture to be a refreshing and eye-opening experience. “I think it’s a wonderful relief that the idea is being presented that we should go back to placing our kids in schools that are the right fit for them. He is debunking the false marketing of colleges, as elite schools are manufacturing these ratios of acceptance,” Stuyvesant parent Terry Rosen said.</p><p>Others believe this lecture was only the beginning of a long battle against tradition. “I think this lecture will have a very small effect because we are up against a huge tradition of pressure to go to name brand schools and by having one talk on one evening with only 400 people in the audience will have a tiny effect. The pressure to go to the most exclusive schools you can go to which has been built up over 20 or 30 years is not going to change very much in one night, but it’s a start,” Venderbush said.</p><p>After the lecture, a question and answer session took place between the audience and Bruni, questioning some of the ideas presented in Bruni’s argument. In one case, junior Roz Joyce asked Bruni whether there was a difference in the caliber of peers in elite and non-elite universities. Bruni responded by stating that in many cases less regarded colleges have a more diverse population, creating a better environment for a student. Bruni went on to say that because students at these elite universities have become so accustomed to receiving opportunities, the level of their interest and appreciation of certain academic benefits is not as prominent.</p><p>Despite the controversy, Bruni stood by his point that although college is important, it is not a deciding factor in a person’s career. “We’re defining best in one way. Were completely equating exclusivity with quality. And that’s just nuts,” Bruni said.</p>	Article	370	2017-12-28 19:51:32.299902	2017-12-28 19:51:32.299902
974	Behind the Extreme Temperatures in the Gyms  <p>The inconsistency in temperatures in Stuyvesant’s gymnasiums has been an ongoing cause of complaint among physical education teachers and students. There are concerns that such facilities may breed discomfort and inhibit motivation and potential. Issues with building infrastructure and technological malfunctions have been discovered to be the cause of these problems.</p><p>The third floor gymnastics gymnasium is often reported to be excessively cold, despite being separated from the third floor main gym, which is often reported to be extremely hot, by only a dividing wall. The sixth floor gymnasium has also reported to be extremely hot at times. These temperature variations can impede athletic performance and can put students’ health at risk. “When it gets too hot it could be a serious problem,” physical education teacher Howard Barbin said. “I try to modify the activities and I let students bring water. We really don’t want to take away any physical activity, but we try not to push them too hard, because overexertion can be dangerous.”</p><p>The root cause of the issue can be traced back to the construction of the new Stuyvesant High School building in 1992. Structural errors that occurred during this construction period led to problematic air ventilation pathways that contributed to the drastic temperature differences. Moreover, air conditioning and heating units were not initially situated in areas that we deem necessary today. Therefore, some of the units are older than others and, as a result, less effective.</p><p>When an air conditioning unit or other associated aspects break down, the custodians can fill a request form for repair by the DOE’s (Department of Education) Division of School Facilities (DSF). “We make repairs with either DOE staff or outside contractors‎ depending on the job. Borough Maintenance Planners at DSF assign the work in the most efficient manner,” DSF Chief Executive Officer John Shea said in an e-mail interview. However, the DSF prioritizes issues that present an immediate danger to the health and safety of students.</p><p>In order to fully resolve the issue, new heating and cooling units would have to be purchased. The administration needs funding from the DOE as well, in the form of grants. These grants have been requested and are currently pending approval. “We have to follow procedure and [gain approval] from the DOE and the building department in order for us to act upon these issues and make effective change,” Principal Jie Zhang said.</p><p>However, at its annual Spring Feast fundraiser, the Stuyvesant Parent Association (PA) in correspondence with Zhang, has moved forward and acquired funds for replacement air conditioning units. Additionally, the school is beginning to notify the DSF in order for change to be implemented as soon as possible, although the administration is unsure of when exactly these changes will be enacted as they rely on the DSF for much of this implementation.</p><p>Zhang recognizes the importance of the issue and continues to take steps towards addressing the extreme temperatures. “Improving the temperature issue by installing air conditioning and heating units [is] definitely at the top of my agenda,” she said. “The only thing we can do at the moment to accommodate student is to allow the custodians to handle the situation [with the DOE].”</p>	Article	372	2017-12-28 19:54:30.167011	2017-12-28 19:54:30.167011
977	CityMD CEO Richard Park Visits Stuyvesant  <p>“You’re at Stuyvesant,” Dr. Richard Park (’90), Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at CityMD and Emergency Medicine physician, said. “You guys are capable and healthy. I can’t tell you how important that is.” Over 150 students gathered on Tuesday, November 10 to listen to Dr. Park as he chronicled the founding of CityMD and why he established a motto of “kindness” as the basis of his business. Dr. Park’s visit was organized by the Stuyvesant Pre-Medical Society and hosted by junior and president Evelyn Gotlieb and sophomore and vice president Sofiya Tsenter.  </p><p>Dr. Park began his lecture by emphasizing that financial circumstances should not determine the opportunities a student is provided. After Dr. Park graduated from Stuyvesant, he chose to take a gap year before attending the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania due to financial difficulties. He described how he felt isolated from his peers because while they were financially-able to attend college, he had to open his own business, a one-hour photo store. Throughout college, Dr. Park commuted from his Pennsylvania dorm to the store every weekend to pay for his education.</p><p>After graduating from Wharton and later completing medical school, Park began his Emergency Medicine residency at Long Island Jewish Hospital. Following his residency, however, Dr. Park was met with the challenges of raising an autistic and nonverbal child. His experiences have led him to establish the premise of kindness for himself and all that he pursues. Though he knows his children will always rely on him in a way non-autistic children would not, he is able to recognize the effects kindness can have on anyone. Dr. Park felt obliged to spread kindness in its simplest forms and carry along this initiative in the creation of CityMD in 2010.  “When you appreciate people and you love people, you can do amazing things. You can do more than you ever knew you could,” Dr. Park said.</p><p>Currently, there are 48 CityMD locations, with a projected 52 by the end of 2015. CityMD locations specialize in urgent care, providing immediate and affordable medical care for people of all ages. Though Dr. Park does not intend to remain CEO since he does not have his Masters in Business Administration, he wants to use his current position to properly communicate and establish a mission statement of serving people with kindness. “The company you create, anything you create, is your artwork. It is a reflection of who you are and your values,” he said.</p><p>Dr. Park recounted his experience with a patient who came into the CityMD in Astoria in excruciating pain, delaying his treatment since he did not have health insurance. CityMD treated the patient free of charge, and he left smiling. “For a few minutes, by saying the procedure was on the house, the world wasn’t broken, and that’s what we all have to do, just spread kindness. Life is tough enough; [we should] make it a little bit easier for someone else,” Dr. Park said. “We didn’t solve any long-term problems here. But for a minute, everything was okay.”</p><p>He went on to explain his philosophy of serving others as crucial to a prosperous career. Dr. Park referenced numerous instances in which the charity of others helped him when he was struggling. Upon renting the first office of CityMD, Dr. Park applied for bankruptcy, until the landowner of the building and now close friend Al Glick, gave him a $300,000 loan, in order to help keep the business afloat.</p><p>However, he acknowledged that revenue must exist in order for CityMD to succeed in the long-term. As an example, he mentioned the creation of the Jackson Heights’ CityMD location, which originally had lost $3,000,000. A result of dedication and hard work, the location is now able to sustain itself and contribute to the revenue of the company.</p><p>Dr. Park explained the growth of CityMD as a combination of timing, luck, and good partners. His passion for his work was a large factor as well. Dedication to his company led to expansion and success, even through hardship. “The only way you can do that, to go the extra mile, is because you love something,” he said.</p><p>Park hopes that his lecture provided an eye-opening experience for students. “It was an opportunity to share the struggles I had growing up and to encourage [students] to have the correct mission and goals in life. People aren’t motivated correctly. This lecture was a reminder to the students as well as myself,” Dr. Park said.</p><p>The Pre-Medical Society feels that Dr. Park accomplished this goal. “Dr. Park’s message conveyed that CityMD is successful because it appreciates and cares for people, serves them instead of taking from them,” Gotlieb said. “Dr. Park wants all prospective doctors to go into the medical field having a love for people and the intention to perpetuate kindness, even in the simple acts of our daily routines.”</p>	Article	375	2017-12-28 19:56:20.803795	2017-12-28 19:56:20.803795
979	﻿Dr. Oliveri Replaces Ubieta as AP Language  <p>Former Assistant Principal (AP) of World Languages Arlene Ubieta resigned from her position in late August after accepting a new role in the Language Department at one of the Department of Education’s (DOE) District Offices in Queens. Interim Acting (IA) AP of World Languages Dr. Ernest Oliveri has taken her place.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri was the AP of Security and the AP of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program (which included their language program), at Washington Irving High School, an underperforming school that closed in 2015.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri discovered his interest in world languages when he began to learn the language of his family’s heritage, Italian, in college. “My parents are Italian. They didn’t speak Italian in the home. I heard it in my grandparents’ home,” he said. “When I went to University I studied Italian, and when I graduated college, I got myself a Euro-pass and I traveled to Italy, just me and my Italian. I fell in love with it, it’s a beautiful country and a beautiful language.”</p><p>Dr. Oliveri continued his language studies after college, building on his high school Spanish when he met his wife. “I married a Spaniard,” he said. “It was really an affair of the heart that brought me back to the study of language.”</p><p>At Stuyvesant, Dr. Oliveri will be teaching the new fifth-year Spanish elective, Great Films From the Spanish Speaking World. “One of the ways I improved my Spanish was by looking at Spanish films. One time I got ahold of a [Spanish] film and I looked at the film for three months with the script in my hand,” he said. “[Films are] a very good way to learn [a] language and it really helped my fluency.”</p><p>Dr. Oliveri also hopes to expand the language opportunities offered to students. He created a fourth-year Latin class because an Advanced Placement Latin course will not be offered this year. Moreover, he is arranging a Japanese film festival with Japanese teacher Chie Helinski.</p><p>“There are other ways to learn a language in a culture other than being in a classroom. There are dimensions to a language [other] than learning to conjugate verbs and learning vocabulary. There is culture and I would like to expand that [at Stuyvesant],” he said.</p><p>Dr. Oliveri will maintain his interim status until the DOE’s C-30 process for permanent hiring is completed. Under this process, an AP candidate must be approved by both IA Principal Eric Contreras and Superintendent Marisol Bradbury.</p><p>Ultimately, Dr. Oliveri hopes to be accessible to both the students and the staff. “I hope the students will feel free to come in and share their highs and lows with me,” he said. “It is my job to help them through that and [I want to establish] the same [relationship] with the staff.”</p><p><hr></p><p><i>Additional reporting done by Julia Ingram</i></p>	Article	377	2017-12-28 20:32:34.776912	2017-12-28 20:32:34.776912
983	﻿German Pop Duo DieLochis Performs at Stuyvesant  <p>The Murray Kahn Theatre was buzzing with activity and anticipation. The seats were filled, and the stage was outfitted with platforms, on which stood a drum set, a keyboard, a DJ booth, and a guitar stand. On either side of the stage were banners promoting the Goethe-Institut, a non-profit German cultural association, and plastered on the back wall was a promotional poster for the German pop duo, DieLochis, that performed on Monday, December 4.</p><p>The duo is comprised of 18-year-old twin brothers Roman and Heiko Lochmann. For the past few weeks they had been touring schools around the United States with the Goethe-Institut as part of their “Schools: Partners for the Future (PASCH)” initiative.</p><p>The Goethe Institut promotes the education of German language and culture and presents contemporary German culture, such as DieLochis, to the world.</p><p>Roman and Heiko Lochmann have been amassing an enormous social media following since starting their YouTube channel six and a half years ago, at age 12. They have nearly 2.5 million YouTube subscribers, a combined total of 2.8 million Instagram followers, and their most popular video currently stands at 22 million views. “Music is and was a big passion our entire life. We [had] already [written] many songs, [played] a lot of music, and we [asked] our teacher if we [could] play at the school event so we [could] be on stage. So, it started very early [on] in our life,” Roman Lochmann said.</p><p>The duo is widely known in Germany: their album made number one on the German billboard charts and and they have a trending hashtag #zwilling, which means “#twin.” However, they admitted to having difficulties performing in the United States. “In Germany, most people know who we are. It’s another experience to play in a country, [where] no one knows who we are, no one knows our songs and stuff. It’s just crazy,” Roman Lochmann said.</p><p>The concert began with opening remarks from Principal Eric Contreras, a representative from the Goethe-Institut, and a representative from the German consulate in New York City. The brothers then ran on stage, spending the next few hours dancing, jumping, and interacting with their band. Throughout the concert they tried their best to pump up the crowd, encouraging people to put their phones away, stand up, dance, and have fun. Though they were not entirely successful, with some students staying seated, the brothers managed to get the majority of the audience moving.</p><p>While their music is in German, English is the twins’ second language, and so in between sets they professed their love for New York and explained the meanings of some of the songs, often talking about universal themes like friendship, heartbreak, and coming of age. “When you feel the music, you don’t have to understand the language to have fun,” Roman Lochmann said. “The main language of music [is] emotions,” Heiko Lochmann said.</p><p>In spite of language barriers, most students responded positively to the performance. “I expected the students to be sitting while two strangers sang at us, but it was actually much more interactive and amazing. It was what I expected an actual concert to be like instead of a showcase or performance,” junior Hanah Jun said.</p><p>The administration is hopeful that similar events can be scheduled soon. “We’re becoming a PASCH school. I think we will [also] be working closer with the Goethe-Institut in the future. They have a lot of interesting programs to offer,” German and French teacher Rebecca Lindemulder said.</p>	Article	381	2018-01-22 16:40:19.520281	2018-01-22 16:40:19.520281
992	﻿The Issue with Sanctuary Cities Sanctuary cities are an outdated way of combating America’s immigration policy, and sensible restrictions must be placed regarding their unwillingness to cooperate with the federal law. <p>The verdict of Zarate’s case emphasizes failures not only in the obstruction of justice, but also in the foundation of some of these very cities.</p><p>Almost two years ago in San Francisco, Kate Steinle was walking with her father and a family friend when she was shot and killed by illegal immigrant Jose Zarate. Zarate, Steinle’s murderer, had been released from jail only three months after the shooting, despite being requested by federal authorities to be detained for deportation long beforehand.</p><p>The trial finally took place a month ago, with a shocking verdict: Zarate walked away charged with solely the possession of a firearm and involuntary manslaughter, as opposed to first or second degree murder. His defense team had argued that Zarate found the gun along the pier, and it “just fired,” a story that the jury bought entirely. Despite his extensive rap sheet, proof that the gun was stolen, and the prosecution’s assurances that the shots were deliberate, Zarate was officially acquitted.</p><p>This incident has since reignited the controversy over America’s immigration policy: particularly the issue with sanctuary cities. True to their moniker, these safe havens for illegal aliens limit how much local law enforcement can comply with federal immigration authorities. San Francisco, for example, passed an ordinance in 1989 which prohibits city employees from complying with I.C.E. workers unless absolutely mandated by law. Many cities across the U.S., such as Newark, East Orange, and Jersey City, have since followed suit, and despite outrage from many right-wing politicians, they have stubbornly kept their compliance with I.C.E. agents minimal.</p><p>Jose Zarate was one of many undocumented immigrants taking advantage of the policy in sanctuary cities. However, his circumstance isn’t unique. A 2005 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined the cases of over 55,000 illegal immigrants incarcerated in federal, state or local prisons. It was found that roughly half of them were previously convicted of a felony, a fifth had been arrested for drug offenses, and they had been arrested an average of seven times each.</p><p>A more recent 2011 GAO report details more of a similar trend. The criminal histories of about 251,000 illegal immigrants showed they committed close to three million criminal offenses. Though these numbers are smaller than that of incarcerated naturalized-citizens, they outweigh the latter disproportionately. According to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the violent crime rate in sanctuary cities exceeds that of non-sanctuary cities. This discrepancy can be chalked up to such a leniency toward the law that encourages residents to silently accept this excessive restraint of justice. People who are already prone to breaking the law are essentially told there are little to no repercussions, and it’s their statuses as illegal immigrants that allow them to embrace such a culture.</p><p>Repeated offenders also tend to put a strain on law enforcement, forsaking both their lives and the extent to which they can exercise authority. After multiple repeat offenses, the danger of keeping these people within society is pervasive, and the options police are given to deal with the issue are lacking. In lieu of deportation (which the crimes of many of these illegal immigrants are more than deserving of), police and law enforcement officials are forced to waste resources and manpower on the same criminals time and time again.</p><p>Not only does this jeopardize the safety of residents of sanctuary cities, it also imposes costs they shouldn’t have to bear. The incarceration of illegal aliens alone (according to the same study) costs about $1.6 billion annually from fiscal years 2005 to 2009, and this number is only continuing to rise. These same tax dollars ought to be properly put to use for residents who paid them, but are instead forced to be used toward services for people who aren’t entitled to them in the first place.</p><p>Steinle’s murder sheds light on some of these complications, motivating Congress to pen “Kate’s Law,” a piece of legislation that increases the penalties for deported persons who return to the U.S. and get caught. While the House managed to pass this legislation, a federal judge has recently blocked President Trump’s executive order to deny funding to sanctuary cities, deeming it unconstitutional. The judge even went as far as to say, “Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the President disapproves.”</p><p>But cutting funding isn’t the only way for the Trump administration to get sanctuary cities to help with the deportation of illegal immigrants who’ve proved incompetent at complying with American standards. Several counties defy even the bare minimum amount of cooperation with the law, such as instructing police to never ask for someone’s immigration status or even setting up defense funds for illegal immigrants paid for through taxes.</p><p>These sorts of actions tip-toe across the line between “lawful” and “unlawful” far too often. Enabling them to persist only solidifies a dangerous sentiment, allowing cities to persistently evade policies. And though Trump’s actions were certainly misguided, his administration had valid intentions. Sanctuary cities are an outdated way of combating America’s immigration policy, and sensible restrictions must be placed regarding their unwillingness to cooperate with the federal law. Prosecutors should not be allowed to drop criminal charges against undocumented immigrants for risk of deportation, and extremely limited government assistance should be given to individuals who exhibit no regard for the law over and over again.</p><p>Allowing sanctuary cities to continue existing in the U.S. as they do now only breeds this innate disrespect for the law. The verdict of Zarate’s case emphasizes failures not only in the obstruction of justice, but also in the foundation of some of these very cities. Steinle’s fate has managed to shed a national spotlight on the recklessness of their approach toward illegal aliens who don’t uphold the law. It needs to be made clear that America won’t stand for it any longer.</p>	Article	390	2018-01-23 02:34:16.948441	2018-01-23 02:34:16.948441
853	﻿Teaching Through the Terror  <p><h4>Matthew Polazzo, social studies teacher</h4></p><p>I was in the inner office here, and I was getting work done [...] and then I heard [Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey] Pedrick through the speaker and she said that it was a shelter-in, and then the next thing I knew there were tons of kids crowding into the SU. So I went out into the middle to see what was going on and through the windows there it seemed like all hell was breaking loose. There were like tons of vehicles driving from all directions, there were cops sprinting everywhere, some with guns drawn.</p><p>From these middle windows over here, you couldn't really see what was exactly going on, but then after watching people running frantically through that window I went out to the outer SU. From the outer SU, paradoxically—you can see it’s further to the south—you still get a better view of the north, because the angle is better, and so that was when, by that time, the police had already put white sheets over the bodies of the two cyclists that had been struck.</p><p>By that time there were a lot of rumors flying around: people said that they had been shot, the news media still had not yet really figured out what was going on, and so the students in the SU and [I] were just trying to figure out what was going on, what happened. Between all the people in there we were able to get a pretty good sense of what had happened, that it was somebody in a truck. We figured out that they had driven south, that the victims hadn’t been shot, they’d probably been struck. We could see the mangled bicycles.</p><p>I couldn’t help but think back to the September 11 attacks, I was in the building for that. On a scale of one to ten this was like a one and that was like a nine in terms of the magnitude, obviously, but in a lot of ways it was similar—the interruption of the day, waiting to find out what was going on, the evacuation of the building, [...] the fact that during both attacks students encountered death. Anyone who looked out the windows of the building were able to see the bodies of the dead people over here, and also paralleled with all those individuals that saw people jumping to their deaths during the 9/11 attack. And then of course the aftermath, in both cases going back into the building and trying to sort of calm down a population that may or may not be sort of shell-shocked by what they saw.</p><p>I never really felt afraid or worried for whatever reason, maybe that was—I don’t know—cockiness or foolishness or maybe an unearned feeling of immortality, but I didn’t feel personally endangered even when I saw the flaying of guns. I can’t really say what that was but I just felt that way. The only time I got a little bit nervous was after it became clear what had happened and I was a little worried that maybe there was like a bomb or something in the truck. But, after that fear was assuaged I never really felt nervous after that.</p><p>I was really proud of the way everyone at Stuy conducted themselves and I’m really sorry that people had to see this event, but hopefully as a community we can come through it together, and become maybe stronger and more resilient.</p><p><h4>Katherine Fletcher, English teacher</h4></p><p>I was with my 10th period freshman composition class [...] And the announcement came over the loudspeaker—it was somewhere around three o’clock—that we were in a shelter-in, and I could tell from the tone of Pedrick’s voice that it was not a drill. I don’t know how I knew, but I just sort of did.</p><p>My students had a piece of writing due that day and we had a sharing day, and the students were reading their writing out loud, and then it became very difficult for them to focus. I could feel the anxiety building in the room, so I actually ducked next door to the teacher workroom and I asked [English teacher Eric] Ferencz what was going on, because the students hadn’t started getting messages from friends and family yet, or checking the news, or whatever, and Ferencz told me that there had been an accident involving a school bus [...]  I was very worried that children had been injured and that was why we weren’t going outside.</p><p>I started trying to think of games we could play. We played three rounds of telephone, where you whisper things into people’s ears. We played a couple rounds of hangman. Some students tried to do some homework [...] Some students started singing “Feliz Navidad,” some students were singing “Guns and Ships” from the musical “Hamilton.” I tried to keep them from becoming incredibly rowdy. They kept their spirits up. But then, slowly, they started to get really restless. A couple of students started pacing.</p><p>When the detectives started coming around and it became apparent that the school was working toward an evacuation, many of my students put on their coats and acted like, even though we weren’t actually going to end up leaving for another 45 minutes or so, they put on their coats and they started hovering by the door. They were very claustrophobic, but very well behaved. I made sure they had all contacted their parents, and a lot of them had their phones out, they were receiving news updates about what was going on. I had a couple of sophomores in my room who didn’t have a class that period and needed to be in a classroom.</p><p>When it was time to evacuate, on 9/11, we had never had to think about how to evacuate in a safe and orderly manner. On 9/11, after the first tower collapsed, the assistant principal came over the loudspeaker and said, “Everyone leave the building and walk north,” and that was it. It was just get out of here and start heading north, and that’s what we all did. We didn’t even have the concept of a shelter-in back then, that didn’t exist; there was no shelter-in, there was no lockdown, that stuff didn’t exist. So I was really impressed of how well-managed the evacuation was. Even though it took a little bit more time, it was really orderly; it just felt very controlled and I was really grateful for that.</p><p>I went home. I have two children. They wanted me to be there to help them celebrate Halloween. I went home and my apartment building was having a Halloween party in the halls, and that was sort of a strange contrast. I didn’t have a sense of whether the whole city was reacting to this attack in the way that we did on 9/11, everything shutting down. If 9/11 had happened on Halloween, there would not have been any Halloween parties that would have happened. Going home to Brooklyn was weird because I realized how in some ways how local and contained the attack was, that it wasn’t reverberating throughout the city in the same way. My kids were not even really very interested in what had happened. My daughter was a little bit.</p><p>One thing that I was really curious about, actually, was what it would be like at school the next day, whether it would be one of these things that was no big deal, business as usual, or if students were going to be coming in the next day feeling really traumatized and needing to process what had happened. It was definitely the second thing. I was surprised at what it felt like to come to school the next day. I wasn’t expecting so many blocks to be cordoned off, and all the bright lights that were shining, and all the emergency vehicles, and it really felt like a disaster zone.</p><p>We spent a lot of time in most of my classes talking about it, and I am particularly conscious of how difficult it is for our Muslim students for the man who committed this act to have said “Allahu Akbar,” which is a prayer that our observing Muslim students say dozens and dozens of times a day, and it only means good and loving things, and so this for this man to sort of claim those words in this violent way, in this hateful way, is really hurtful, and so makes life really difficult for our Muslim students in ways that I wish I could protect them from. It’s horrible.</p><p><h4>Annie Thoms, English teacher</h4></p><p>I was teaching my 10th period Freshman Composition class; we were reading the Joy Luck Club, and we were discussing the story “Double Face,” and it was a lesson I really enjoy teaching and everyone was really into it. And then Pedrick came on the loudspeaker and announced that we were gonna have a shelter-in and I thought, “Oh it must be a drill, I didn’t remember seeing that on, you know the schedule for the drills, but you know it must be a drill.” And then she came on again like five minutes later and it was like, that seems odd. And then I started to be aware of the sirens outside and this classroom faces more north, so we started hearing emergency vehicles and seeing emergency vehicles and then hearing a lot of emergency vehicles, but I kept the lesson going and wanted to try and get to the end of it and also wanted to keep everybody focused on that, rather than gathered by the windows in a panicked state.</p><p>By the time we realized what had happened, it was over and then it was just sort of the waiting game [...] Pedrick just kept coming on the loudspeaker and then just kept telling us to wait in place, and my students are a really lovely group of ninth graders and they were terrific, I mean they were singing karaoke and some of them did their homework and they braided each other’s hair and they started doodling on the boards and they drew diagrams of mitochondria and started writing their Mandarin homework on the board.</p><p>In terms of the actual incident, this was a much smaller and contained incident than the attacks of September 11th. [...] On the morning of September 11th, I came in on a late schedule, and I actually got off the subway after the second plane had already hit. I didn't have a class of my own that morning, but I came into the building and then we were sent to homeroom fairly shortly after that. So I was with my homeroom, my freshman homeroom, and it was in the cafeteria for whatever reason, and so that was where we were evacuated from. So it was much more of a sense of a, chaos is a strong word, but it was much more a sense of like improvisation, you know; we didn’t know, the administration didn’t know what was happening.</p><p>After September 11th, I was in my second year teaching here and I had just become the theater faculty advisor, and so I worked with a group of [ten] students [...] and we created this play called With Their Eyes. [It used] interview-based monologues, so it was in the style of actors and playwrights and editors and so these ten students, the ten student actors, interviewed 27 members of the Stuyvesant community about their stories. [...] One of the things that struck me in 2001 and was one of the reasons why I decided to do this with the winter drama in 2001 is also very striking to me right now, which is that the human instinct [is] to tell your own story right after something like this happens. [...] I think that that’s a very human need, and I think that listening to the details of other people’s experience is incredibly valuable. I think that it is an exercise in empathy, and that it helps you remember and understand that our reactions to something like this are wildly varied and diverse and that’s fine, that’s totally valid.</p><p>I will say that one of the things that has frustrated me over the last couple of days was sort of the craziness of the media coverage, which was also true after September 11th. You know, you have reporters just like mobbing people, and mobbing our students [...] I had reporters calling me for the last two days, you know, calling me and e-mailing me. Everybody just wants to tell the same story, and they all want to tell like this tiny slice of the story, but all the same thing, over and over.</p><p><h4>Gary Rubinstein, mathematics teacher</h4></p><p>I was with my 10th period class and when we heard that there was a lockdown we eventually looked out the window and saw the bus that looked like it was crashed pretty bad, it looked like a bomb because there was a big charred area. We thought that was everything and that was the whole incident so we were watching out this window, the south window, we didn’t realize, had we looked out the east window it would be bodies on bike paths. Most of the time we were looking out at the bus rescue. We did not see the chase. On Tuesday the truck was right outside this window so unfortunately we were in a position where we saw things we wished we hadn’t seen.</p><p>It’s pretty scary to think that you could [have been] walking home from school or [have] been an innocent bystander in this and also I feel bad that my students had to see a bus crash and people coming out in a stretcher and that they had to see victims themselves lying on the ground and that was hard for them. I think a lot of students feel like they’re not affected by it but it might affect them later on, I worry about that.</p><p><h4>David Hanna, social studies teacher</h4></p><p>I was on the subway heading to Penn Station to catch a train home to New Jersey. I was unaware of what was happening. I didn't learn of the attack until my wife saw something about it online, after we had returned from trick-or-treating with our younger son. My initial reaction was shock, and then concern about students and colleagues at Stuy. It wasn’t clear yet what had actually happened. Just that people had been run into by a truck.</p><p>I walked across the footbridge about ten minutes before it happened. This upset my wife. She probably was thinking, “What if [he] had left ten minutes later?” My sons, in as much as they were aware of the attack, at least to my knowledge didn't associate it with Stuyvesant. And I would like to keep it that way, if possible. I don’t want them to worry about me being in New York. They have enough to deal with at school, etc., without worrying about me.</p><p>Sadly, I'm not surprised by these types of events anymore. It's the world that we've lived in for some time now. But you can't stop living your life. That was my feeling in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and I've held to that ever since. I will say that the eagerness of some to seize on this event to try to push a divisive agenda must be confronted. If ever there was a time to reach out and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our classmates, colleagues, and fellow New Yorkers who are Muslim, it is right now. I heard a story on NPR about the five friends from Argentina that were killed in the attack, and it really spoke to me. They were about my age, and they were out there living their lives to the fullest. I respect that. And I mourn for them, and the other victims of the attack, and their families.</p><p>I think it's important that the suspect be tried in a criminal court for murder, and not to give him the political "enemy combatant" platform he seems to want.</p><p><h4>“Eric Grossman, Assistant Principal of the English Department”</h4></p><p>By the time I realized what was happening, it was over because it happened very fast. It took me a while to register “Oh no!”</p><p>I wanted to make sure the students and staff were safe. I quickly found others from the administration and tried to get a sense of what they knew. The driver was apprehended very quickly, and once we were aware of something, he was already in custody. Very quickly, there were a lot of police officers and FBI agents. So I was not fearful about what was going on here. Overwhelmingly I saw kids were playing telephone, drawing on the board, signing songs; it seemed safe and not as horrifying and no one from Stuyvesant was seriously injured.</p><p>The feeling was very similar [to 9/11], the sense of some kind of outside threat that quickly became international news. We [were] in the building and getting e-mails and texts from former colleagues, former students, and faculty who were watching live while we were inside. The scale thankfully, was very different. The sense of participating in something historically can be tragic.</p><p>I don't know anyone who thinks anything other than what happened was terrible and the work of someone deranged. I know that the attack will be used for political purposes. My response is to want to make sure that all of our students, especially our Muslim students, can feel safe, respected, and totally free to change or anything like that.</p><p><h4>Dan Esposito, English teacher</h4></p><p>I was in the English teachers’ room and I was grading papers. That’s when we got the first shelter-in announcement. That seemed pretty normal. I think that a lot of people’s first impulse was that it was a drill or something. Just kind of out of curiosity I walked over to the window, and that’s when I saw people running. My first thought was that they were running away from basically where the World Trade Center was, where the Freedom Tower is. So that was kind of worrying. Those of us who were around sort of tried to piece together what was actually going on. The first thing we saw was the bus that had been hit, and it looked really scary. We didn’t really know what to make of it, so the next 30 minutes were just very confusing and frightening in the sense that we couldn’t get a full picture of what was happening other than what we could see out of this one, very limited, view of the window.</p><p>It was very jumbled at first, like it is in these things all the time. We were hearing all different things from different people, and I think that’s definitely scary. What was reassuring was seeing how level-headed everyone was staying, especially the students and the teachers. Everybody kind of knew what to do and knew how to respond. That was super helpful, not panicky or non-responsive. That was really inspiring. Throughout the night, what the school did such a terrific job of was, even though things were unclear and still very frightening, the school did such a good job of making everyone inside feel safe. At least that was the experience I had. There was a ton of announcements.</p><p>I think pretty early on, we got the impression that all students were safe inside, and that was a huge relief. I was kind of shut off in one little room with a few students who had been in the hallway.  I know Grossman was running around checking in on people, and you got this impression that everyone wanted to make sure everyone else was okay, and that was very reassuring.</p><p>What I remember is that everybody was kind of working together to piece together as much of a full story as we could get. We had one student with a laptop out who had a news report, and people were on their phone, people were sent Snapchat videos that other students on the bridge had taken. It did feel like very much like what a newsroom must feel like, of piecing together this story. It was just kind of surreal because we were in it, as we were trying to figure out what was going on. The attitude that all the students had for each other was very supportive and calming. Even though we were in here for so long, it made the whole thing more okay.</p><p>The Halloween parade runs right past my apartment. So I got off the train, and I was in the middle of this party and it was so surreal because I had gone from this really intense, emotional experience to this very silly Halloween party. That was, I think, jarring in a way. I went straight home. I feel like I got into my apartment, sat down, and I exhaled for the first time in four hours. I definitely needed to decompress for a little bit. I felt really proud of everyone else, and students especially. [I am] honored to be part of a school that can face crisis the way that Stuyvesant came together [and] faced it the other day.</p>	Article	251	2017-12-02 05:33:00.040151	2017-12-02 05:33:00.040151
855	﻿After the Allahu Akbar Moment: How Muslims at Stuyvesant Feel After the Attacks  <p>The attacks carried out by Sayfullo Siapov on Tuesday, October 31, occurred on Chambers Street, making Stuyvesant the center of a crime scene. After the attacks, it was publicized that Siapov yelled “Allahu Akbar” and has affiliations with ISIS, which has caused an influx of Islamophobia and hate speech against Muslims. Celebrities like Laura Loomer have made tweets that target and degrade women who wear hijab and Muslims in general, forcing Muslim students at Stuyvesant, who are no different from any other student who witnessed these attacks, to defend their religious faith and humanity.</p><p><b>Syeda Rahman, 10th Grade </b></p><p>“I was really annoyed to hear that that this guy yelled out, “Allahu akbar” when he came out of the truck, but I hate to say that I wasn't surprised. Whenever you hear about radical Islamists doing terrorists attacks, people tend to put all Muslims under the same umbrella. They think Islam is equivalent to radical Islamist views.</p><p>I stopped wearing the hijab out of fear. My parents told me that I should try not to look suspicious. People I know try what they can to not look suspicious and to hide where they're from essentially. For instance, some people with bulky bags try to carry less. Little things like that assure us that we aren't confronted.</p><p>After the attack, I can't stop replaying the sounds in my head, especially the gunshots. The fact that it happened is hard to process, but at the time, it was so surreal. I try to distract myself and tell myself I'm safe.</p><p>Being affected by the attack and seeing it makes it different. Honestly, every time you hear about an attack, we tend to slide it off and think of it as another attack. But I understand that every attack is important in its own way. Experiencing it myself kind of made me realize that it's not just another attack because it affects people in different places and ways. Also, I wish that people wouldn’t base their views about Islam on these attacks because they aren't representative the whole Muslim population. I'm afraid of the people afraid of me.”</p><p><b>Ayham Alnasser, 10th grade</b></p><p>“I was at Battery Park when the attacks happened. I heard the car crash, and I thought it was a UPS truck right in front of the park, so I didn’t think much about it. I walked up towards Stuyvesant to see if the UPS truck crashed. But that was when I saw the perpetrator walk out. I was going to take my phone out to record what was happening, but it was dead. I watched him run out and scream, “Allahu akbar.” After that, I saw the police officer shoot him six times. Being at the crime scene, a police officer escorted me to the school because it wasn’t safe for me to be there. When I was in school, I was a part of the lockdown for the next three hours. When I came back home, my phone charged, and I checked and saw that I got 20 texts. It didn’t really set in [that] I just witnessed this attack.</p><p>Reflecting on the situation now,  I consider myself to be a Muslim, so when I first heard him come out and say “Allahu Akbar,” I was irritated by the fact that he would say it. It’s clear that he isn’t really a Muslim because he killed people. He just pissed me off as a Muslim and as a student at Stuyvesant. I am not unnerved by the incident, even though I have seen a lot because the [cop shooting him] was warranted. I’m not traumatized by the incident. It only helps me further respect the NYPD. I don’t like how much this incident has been so publicized because it's become politicized, and it stops the incident from actually being an actual murder and just becomes a statistic.”</p><p><b>Stephanie Raza, 10th Grade</b></p><p>“I’ve heard various reports about whether the perpetrator even said, “Allahu akbar” when he came out of the truck. It could be that he was just saying something in a foreign language and people are so scared or racist they just assume he said “Allahu akbar.” I was kind of disappointed seeing people categorize this attack as being done by another Muslim and it being so publicized because of that. When the Las Vegas shooting happened, people jumped to the assumption that he had a mental disorder before they said the massacre was a terror attack. But in this case, they jumped on the opportunity to call it a bloodbath or a terror attack without having details fully confirmed.”</p><p><b>Yasmeen Hassan, 9th Grade</b></p><p>“A lot of my friends saw the attack happen, and they didn’t hear the man say “Allahu akbar.” I know that people have different stories, but I think just that part of the story stuck because people want to know this was part of a community or a bigger organization, so they can [turn their fear into] hatred. The next day on the subway, I was coming to school, and there was a newspaper on the seat right next to me, and the front page had “Terrorist Attack: Deadliest Since 9/11.” This title isn’t true because there have been a lot of attacks and mass shootings which have killed hundreds of people. Also, when I was going to the subway, I was terrified about what the people next to me are going to do or say to me when they see me because I’m Muslim. There was literally a woman reading about the attack on her phone, and I was just sitting there worrying if she was going to say something to me.</p><p>I was a bit shaken up by the attacks. I wondered why would Muslims do this to other people. If he was really a Muslim, why would he do it? He would be putting his family and everyone that is close to him in danger. I see this as a test from God to see how Muslims are going to handle this situation. Someone told me, ‘Our religion is going to be put under a lot of pressure, and it’s a test to see who’s going to power through and have faith in God to protect them.’</p><p>I know this community is pretty safe, but there is always one person that’s going to do something that is not right. I think the best thing we can do is stay strong.”</p>	Article	253	2017-12-02 05:47:15.689732	2017-12-02 05:47:15.689732
856	﻿After The Attack Who even knows, honestly? <p>I’ve written this article before—or at least something very similar.</p><p>I wrote it in 2015, after the Paris terror attacks; suicide bombers targeted a stadium and various restaurants and cafes, killing 130 people and injuring 413. Prior to that attack, various Middle Eastern countries had already been targets of deadly shootings, bombings, and explosions, but I think of the Paris attack as the first in a pattern of homegrown domestic terrorism in Europe, incited by ISIS’s propaganda. It was jarring to Europeans, Americans overseas, and the world at large. In the Opinions article I wrote following the attacks, I mourned the victims. I cautioned people not to paint Muslims with the brush of terrorism. I condemned the cowards who claimed to be Muslims and then took innocent lives.</p><p>It was a message that I knew I might have to deliver again—when the Brussels and Istanbul attacks occurred, when trucks drove over civilians in Nice and Berlin, when a van struck pedestrians on the London Bridge. But I never anticipated an attack near Stuyvesant. I never anticipated the masses of police officers that would be standing outside our school the next day or the deafening silence as throngs of people wearing black navigated a maze of barricades and orange vests, unsure of what to say and where to walk. We referred to it as “what happened yesterday” instead of calling it a terrorist attack—the latter would have felt too real. Frankly, I don’t think I ever anticipated Stuyvesant would be on the news for anything besides our cheating scandal, racial imbalance, and alumni disputes, but here we are.</p><p>I consider myself fortunate that I don’t have to deliver that message again, that I don’t have to remind you not to conflate Muslims with terrorists, that I don’t have to tell you that the Diversity Visa Lottery is one of America’s finest points, because I’m not entirely convinced that you need to hear it. I keep thinking of the way Stuyvesant responded to Donald Trump’s inflammatory remarks during his campaign; the way Stuyvesant came together after the 2016 election; the way we responded to the travel ban. Pundits online blame the attack on America’s supposedly lax immigration system, calling for stricter vetting and limited immigration, but I’m not sure they know that this is the last thing on Stuyvesant’s collective mind and that we are more focused on looking out for each other than looking for someone to blame.</p><p>I certainly never anticipated the words “Allahu Akbar” to come out of a terrorist’s mouth after he attacked my community. Allahu Akbar doesn’t belong in the mouths of evil; it belongs during prayers, during congratulations and celebrations and dinner and laughter, during miracles. You might have heard that Allahu Akbar means “God is great.” This is false. Allahu Akbar means “God is greater.” Greater than you or me, greater than some psychopath who is so afraid of life that he would try to snuff it out. Not everyone at Stuyvesant is religious, of course, but I think the concept of believing in something greater than yourself is one that strikes a chord within all of us.</p>	Article	254	2017-12-02 05:51:14.284651	2017-12-02 05:51:14.284651
858	﻿Student Responses  <p><h4>Julian Giordano, freshman</h4></p><p>I was in the Student Union room on the second floor [...] the doors closed and some guy started talking, and he said something along the lines of “there’s a guy [and] he has guns.”</p><p>Everyone else in the room was like, no, there were no shots, no, he doesn't have a gun. We didn't hear anything, so it made no sense. Two minutes later, all of a sudden, we heard the distant sirens. [So] we went to the window [and] we saw traffic at a complete standstill. You walk over the West Side Highway every day [yet] you never see the cars stop. But here you just have, it’s like someone clicked pause and all of a sudden all the cars are just stopped where they are.</p><p>What was most alarming to me and sort of frightening was [that we] saw no one on the path. There was this one Citi Bike right in front of the window just dropped, sitting on its side. It was next to a group of Citi Bikes, but there was this one fallen. And if you looked up the path to your left there was this one Citi Bike and it was folded [on the] path. I didn't see anything at first so I tried to look it up on the news. There were rumors we were on a soft lockdown, no one really knew what was happening. It started popping up on the news and when I walked back to the window I saw these white sheets on the ground.</p><p>We heard the PA system and then the Student Union coordinator [Matthew] Polazzo was in the hallway. He came in and he started looking out the window as well and he told us to stay calm, and then an announcement came over the PA system about a lockdown, and then we started getting news from multiple sources. And then people started calling their parents, and all you heard was people calling their parents and everyone was huddled by the window.</p><p>By around 4:30 [p.m.], approaching [5:00 p.m.], FBI agents and the police came into the school, I think. Some walked into our room with administrators and told us to get away from the windows. No one had been thinking that, no one knew what was happening but it could have actually been a threat to look out the window. If there had been an active gunman that could have been a problem.</p><p>Not knowing what happened was almost worse than knowing. I knew people who had ninth and 10th periods free sitting by the [mural outside], and that was literally where the man crashed the car by the intersection. No one knew if their friends were okay, and it was really worrying and really, really scary to not know.</p><p><h4>Andrew Hirtle, sophomore</h4></p><p>I was walking to Pier 40; the car must have driven by me on the bike path. We were on the river so we didn’t see it. We got to Pier 40 and then we saw like 10 ambulances and tons of police cars and fire trucks, and we just assumed it was a bad car accident so we went into the pier, [but] like five minutes later we came back out to check it out. We walked up to the bike path and we saw pools of blood, bloodied-up jackets, broken bikes with blood on them, and people crying. It was something out of a movie almost.</p><p>It didn’t hit me until the day after; I was like, wow, that sucks, it’s really messed up, but I wasn't in shock in the moment, I was like, wow, this is terrible. I had known the shots had happened at Stuy by then, [but] I didn't know what was going on, I didn't know if they were connected or not.</p><p>We tried to ask a police officer what happened, [but] they brushed us off, so we went back inside to Pier 40 on the field and waited while helicopters flew over us, and we just waited for our coach to come who was like, “You should go home.” It happened between [3:00 and 4:00 p.m.].</p><p>Yesterday, what I saw and what happened, I wouldn’t say I was traumatized but I was in shock yesterday; it was all kind of surreal, all that had happened in front of me. It wasn’t that bad coming to school, it was more like when everyone talked about it, just thinking about it made me uneasy almost, but like I’m fine now.</p><p><h4>Michelle Yang, junior</h4></p><p>I was at the window that was facing the lawn, so if you tilted your head you could see the school bus but you couldn’t see the actual truck that came from the West Side Highway. It started with the lockdown. I didn’t think that it was a serious thing. I thought that it was another drill since Stuyvesant usually does all these drills. I started realizing it was getting serious when [Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey] Pedrick was on the announcements saying the drill was going to continue.</p><p>My mom called me. She works at Union Square and she found out what happened before I did. She called me right when it was 3:35 and I was still in class and she said she was coming down from Union Square all the way to Chambers Street. I asked her, “Why are you coming to Chambers Street? Don’t you know there’s probably a suspect out there?”</p><p>I didn’t expect school to be open [Wednesday, November 1]. I kind of did expect it. I just thought that things were going to be a little different, but surprisingly classes were still pretty normal. I just didn’t know New York was going to be the next target. I heard about such attacks in Barcelona or in Las Vegas but I didn’t expect New York, again in the same territory as 9/11. As a person who grew up in New York, I felt kind of attacked in my identity.</p><p>Oh, and the reporters. When I was walking out of school there were all these reporters lining up, there was literally an entire string of TV channels with TV cameras set up. They were so malicious in a way; they just approached students and were asking questions like “Did anything happen?” [and] “Did you see anything? What did you feel?”</p><p>There was this one reporter who kept asking me for [my] name. They just kept asking my name. I explicitly told them I wasn’t comfortable telling them my name. Then they asked me, “What’s your English name?” [and] I was kind of offended. Next, they asked me, “Can I get a photo of you?” and I was like, “No, I’m not comfortable with that either.” The way they wanted information just to be added to the next article, it was just not what I expected from the media.</p><p><h4>Laith Bahlouli, freshman</h4></p><p>We saw him walk around the vicinity, walk around the road, and he was carrying two guns, [at least] they looked like guns. Then someone screamed he has a gun, and then immediately a lot of people started running away, and then this dude in a green shirt started to chase after the attacker, tried to chase him, and they were running around the entire intersection, and then the attacker [came] very close to the sidewalk. The sidewalk is separated by the road by a gate, he was right at the gate.</p><p>They continued walking around that area and chasing after each other. I turned my head because my friend said that we should leave, and then I heard the gunshot, four or five, I look back and I see Saipov on the ground and somebody screams and then everyone starts running, it was almost like a stampede. And then I run like three feet, and then me and this kid turn around and we run back to continue to see what happened.</p><p>[My friend and I] went on top of the bridge and we saw exactly what happened. They hadn’t covered the bodies yet and we were able to actually look at the bodies. They were on the side of the highway where the Citi Bikes are. There were two bikes crushed, just thrown about, and there [were] two bodies: one right next to the Citi Bikes and one back next to the trees.</p><p>It was pretty scary because Saipov came really, really close and he even looked back on me. And we actually saw, well I only caught a glimpse of the Home Depot truck crashing, [but] it was pretty intense.</p><p>It felt weird [coming back]. It was unbelievable, the way the police had blocked everything off, it was a big crime scene that people just the day before had died on the very land. I heard that eight people had died; it was kind of scary to see all the police with their heavy weaponry, everything was so odd going through a different entrance, and even the victims and the injured weren’t even released at that time. It was very uncomfortable.</p><p><h4>Debi Saha, sophomore</h4></p><p>I was in Spanish [class] when everything happened. I was closest to the window following Pedrick’s announcement. Everyone thought it was a drill. We joked about sitting out of the view of the windows and crouching under our desks. However, after the subsequent announcements and the audible sound of sirens, it was clear that this wasn’t a drill. The thing I remember most is the astounded silence with this backdrop of silence. The gravity of the situation was unclear but as people started to pull out their phones, a feeling of dread started to make its place in my stomach. The gravity of the situation truly sunk in when an FBI agent checked our IDs, when I saw the flashing red lights, [and] when I saw the suspect’s truck the next morning. Everything I had heard and seen was a whirlwind in my mind. I had peers who had seen the suspect pull out the fake guns, fearful that they were real. I had peers who were there and started running. I had peers who had seen the trail of dead bodies. That was something I kept thinking about. Imagine seeing these victims. Imagine not knowing where the bikes started and the bodies ended. If I [had been] there, I [don’t] know if I would have ran away or tried my best to help. My friend later [showed] me a picture of a dead body. I could not stop returning to the eight people who lost their lives. These were people who had families, loved ones, homes, and it was taken away from them. Following this was a barrage of posts on Facebook. Each one I saw seemed to break my heart and repair it back simultaneously. The posts about terrorism made me stop.</p><p><h4>Maxwell Lin, senior</h4></p><p>I was coming back from the subway station and I saw some freshmen running away from the direction of the bridge, but I thought they were running from a fire because they had set fire to a bag as a joke. So I didn’t think anything of it. So I kept walking to the bridge. And when I got to the intersection, I saw the the terrorist guy. He was holding up two guns. He was also chasing two other people from what I saw around the cars. When he rounded a corner, I just heard three shots and then I just turned around.</p><p>I didn't take it too seriously because I just wanted to get back into the school and didn’t know that he had already did so much damage with his vehicle. So I just thought that he was one gunman.</p><p>I did try to get back onto the bridge, but when I was on the bridge they had already administered the lockdown, so the doors were locked. I was with four other Stuy kids but they couldn't get in, either.</p><p>I was with the four other kids and the five of us were just really angry because what if the gunman had come up onto the bridge with a real gun. The five of us would've been dead. I think it's reasonable that they had the lockdown, but I think they should have put two guards at the door to let the students in because we couldn't get in and we were just stuck on one end of the bridge.</p><p><h4>Sehrish Ali, junior</h4></p><p>When we first heard the tires, obviously we thought, we are in the middle of New York City, so it wasn’t a huge thing, but someone who was sitting next to the window kind of gasped so everyone ran to see what happened and we ended up seeing people getting hit and stuff. Before they called the shelter-in we knew something was happening. We didn’t know it was as serious as it ended up being, but we knew people got hit.</p><p>I wasn’t in my class at the moment, I was up on the ninth floor. The teacher who was on the ninth floor with that class did not continue teaching, but eventually I had to go back down to my math class and the teacher downstairs thought it was a drill when they announced a shelter-in so he kept on teaching until students told him that people had actually died outside.</p><p>During the shelter-in, announcements were being made, [and] I thought that [they were] shocking. I get that they were trying to keep kids calm, but I felt like the way that they went about it, first of all not telling us what was going on outside, which made a lot of teachers think it was a drill and not an actual shelter-in, and then the way they were kind of cheery about it. I guess they were serious, but the way they were talking about it made it seem like Pedrick was cheering almost. I thought that was shocking given the circumstances because I felt that she should have been more solemn and more appropriate for what was going on outside.</p><p>When I was walking back to my class, I am not going to lie, I was pretty scared because there was no one in the hallways. I felt that there should have been more teachers standing in the hallways just to make sure that if kids were out using the bathroom or something that they would safely get back in the classrooms.  I guess there was no threat in there but at the same time we as students didn’t know what was going on outside because no one told us.</p><p><h4>Ziyun Zhang, sophomore</h4></p><p>I was walking down the staircase toward Terry’s and then I came back up to the bridge. I saw the crash into the post and saw the man take out two pistols and then I heard gunshots. I think my brain has kind of washed out the rest but that’s pretty much all I saw. [The people] were all crazed and as soon as he came out I heard screams and people were scrambling for cover. I saw the elementary schoolers across the street rushing back inside.</p><p>The vehicles just kind of stopped there, I think. The bikes were all knocked over. There was soil all over the ground. And the truck was pretty smashed up [...] and it smelled like gunpowder. I could smell it from the bridge. I was dazed and I honestly had no idea how to react. If it wasn’t for my friend dragging me back up the stairs towards Stuy I don’t think I would have done anything at all. I was frozen to the spot.</p><p>I remember some stayed by the staircase to keep watching and someone took out their phone? I don’t remember who. But others ran back. They were shocked and they didn’t know what was happening but someone screamed that there was a man with a gun outside.</p><p>I didn’t really feel anything but I think I’m finally getting the aftershock that this really happened and all these what ifs are running through my head and I can't imagine what the families of those who died must be feeling right now. Honestly, I think social media kind of blew the story out of proportion. I heard that some claimed it was a terrorist attack and I think it just kind of promoted Islamophobia again.</p><p>Some were making jokes about the whole situation and others were like, “I heard the man said, ‘Allahu Akbar’ as he took out the guns,” and I think that it’s wrong to just spread a story like that because it’s really easy for facts to get twisted along the way.</p>	Article	256	2017-12-02 05:57:38.342494	2017-12-02 05:57:38.342494
859	﻿“I’m extremely scared:” From Dr. Zhang’s Perspective  <p>I found Dr. Yanjun Zhang in one of the biology labs on Thursday, November 2. Despite being the only person from Stuyvesant directly harmed in Tuesday’s attacks, he had only missed one full school day. Dr. Zhang, a lab specialist for the biology department, seemed to be doing well. He was shuffling around the labs with another teacher, cleaning things up, and arranging for the next lab. His right pinky and ring finger were both bandaged, and his right hand was noticeably swollen—a battered rainbow of yellows, greens, purples and blues—but it didn’t seem to bother him at all. He even asked me to come back during his free period because he didn’t want to leave the other teacher alone with the work.</p><p>During the attacks on Tuesday, Dr. Zhang was one of the Citi Bike riders hit by the truck. He was only injured in a minor way, but the person in front of and behind him were both killed. When I finally did get to talk to him, he told me his story.</p><p><b>Tell me what happened from your perspective.</b></p><p>My working hours are from eight to three, so on that day, I left a few minutes past three. And then I went downstairs as usual and picked up one Citi Bike. You know there’s a yard in front of the building and the bike path. I had just entered the bike path. I saw a truck driving in my direction, southbound, very fast, so I got very scared. I immediately stopped my bike. My position was about half in the path. The truck was very fast. Actually, the truck was on the other side of the path, so if the truck kept going in that direction, it wouldn’t hit me. I think the truck intentionally turned in my direction to hit me, and it hit my front wheel. Because the truck was so fast, the bike was hit, and then it tumbled, so I was also flipped backward.</p><p>It happened so fast—I don’t even remember what happened. I remember I tumbled backwards and stood up. I remembered that there were some instructions from my old instructors for emergencies, that I was supposed to talk to people right away, so I immediately asked people, “Am I bleeding? Am I bleeding?” and then they responded saying, “You’re okay, you’re okay.” But I was actually bleeding. And at that time, I heard somebody say, “He’s got a gun!” So I hid behind something solid. I ran behind a building, and I heard something similar to gunshots—I had no idea if they were gunshots because I was on the other side of the building.</p><p>Later on, I came out. I saw a lot of policemen, and I went to look at the bike I was riding. The front wheel was distorted. At that time, I was bleeding, so I told the policeman that that was my bike, and he told me to sit down and that he was going to get an ambulance for me. A few detectives also came to me to get information and take pictures of my driver’s license. I was put in an ambulance, and after some time, it brought me to the hospital, very close to the Brooklyn Bridge. I think it’s the Brooklyn Bridge, but I don’t really know.</p><p>At the hospital, they made me go through a lot of tests to make sure that my body was not damaged. One of the EMT guys said that I probably had my hand broken, because it was deformed so badly, but after all the x-rays, they found out that it wasn’t broken—it was just tissue damage.</p><p>There’s a lot of bruising and swelling. The whole body—there are lots of minor damages.</p><p><b>How long were you at the hospital?</b></p><p>I think they brought me to the hospital at about six. I was released at about 11. I remember I arrived at home sometime around 11 or 12, so I would say about five hours. Two of my colleagues actually came. They somehow got information from detectives. Detectives usually don’t give out information like that, but they came to visit me. It was very moving. The FBI has some kind of victim counseling agents, and there was a lady there to provide some kind of comforting effort, and my two colleagues came, so we were talking about it. At that time, I was very disoriented and very confused, and with them talking to me, it began to clear my mind a little bit. It has been very helpful.</p><p><b>How come you only stayed at home for one day?</b></p><p>Yesterday, I felt that there were too many wounds, and I shouldn’t come. But today, I felt that I should come, mostly to be with my colleagues and talk to them in a stable environment. It’s psychologically better to be communicating in an environment where people can talk to each other.</p><p><b>Do you feel okay?</b></p><p>Um, not okay, but not really that painful. I just can’t get the swelling off. But I asked some people, and they gave me all sorts of suggestions.</p><p><b>So how do you feel about it?</b></p><p>I don’t really have a lot of general opinions about it yet, but I’m deeply moved by the support that I’ve gotten from my colleagues. There are times where in normal situations we might have conflicts, but when bad things happen, the true natures of my colleagues show up. They are very, very decent people. They care about me very much. I believe that I care about them just as much.</p><p><b>How has the attack affected you?</b></p><p>Yes, I feel I have been very fortunate.</p><p><b>Were you here for 9/11?</b></p><p>I was in a different high school. At that time, I worked in Jamaica High School in Queens, so I saw it from the other side of a river.</p><p><b>Did that experience change your experience of this at all?</b></p><p>It’s difficult to say. I should say yes, because since then, we’ve gotten all sorts of trainings. Our whole society is more alert. At that time, we weren’t informed that easily.</p><p><b>Has the administration contacted you?</b></p><p>The principal called me! And even after that, he gave me his personal phone number and asked me to call him anytime. They are very concerned, and they are very supportive. Also, my colleagues are very supportive too. I am here and they always ask me not to do anything and whatever I want to be done, they will do it for me (He chuckles). It’s very moving.</p><p><b>Have you been emotionally affected by this?</b></p><p>Yes. I’m extremely scared. I have never been in such a situation where two people have died right in front of me. I still can’t comprehend the situation. Two bicycle riders were, just a moment ago, alive people, and now they’re lying there, lifeless. It’s very difficult to deal with. That’s part of the reason I want to be with people. To be stabilized by people. After all, we are social animals.</p>	Article	257	2017-12-02 06:00:28.379587	2017-12-02 06:00:28.379587
860	﻿Staff Editorial, Volume CVIII Issue 5  <p>During 10th period on October 31, The Spectator Editorial Board was celebrating Halloween in room 639, on the west side of the building. We were distracted by candy, college apps, and talk about our next issue. While some students were facing horrors no high schooler should have to, we only began to learn of the attack from Snapchat stories and Twitter feeds. We were able to follow the news minute by minute from inside our classroom, occasionally reading inaccurate accounts during the preliminary stages of the investigation.</p><p>Most students had a very different experience. Some were on the Tribeca Bridge or on the wall, some were watching out the window, and some heard gunshots. Some teachers continued to teach their classes. Although every student in the building was on the same block as the attack, we were isolated through the well-enforced three-hour lockdown, sealing us off from the incident. You can find many of their stories in their own words throughout this issue.</p><p>Though the attack has been covered heavily in the media, Stuyvesant’s role has been largely overlooked. Students provided much of the footage and photographs used by police and media outlets. The first floor of the building was used as a command center for the investigation and hosted the mayor and governor as they were briefed on the events of the afternoon. The exterior of the school was used as a backdrop for press conferences. Most of all, the event has a lasting effect on students, though reactions have differed greatly among individuals.</p><p>Students have cried, students have made jokes, students have posted long reflections on their social media accounts. The various ways that students have expressed their feelings on the subject have prompted many to question others’ reactions. While some do not hesitate to call jokes inappropriate, others have used humor to distract themselves from the gravity of the events. Everyone copes differently, and the way one expresses him- or herself on the outside does not always reflect how he or she is feeling on the inside. Inappropriate responses do exist, but the line is not easily drawn. Despite the differences, the majority of the school came together on Wednesday, November 1, to wear black in mourning for the victims, a show of solidarity and support that transcends individual opinions.</p><p>And to freshmen, this incident should not cast a dark shadow on your four years at Stuyvesant. This attack has clearly made us aware of transgressions against our safety—bringing terrorism to our doorstep. It is understandable to be afraid. Yet, in light of this, we celebrate the overwhelming strength and compassion that the school at large responded with to the terrible attack. This solidarity comes without surprise to the upperclassmen of the school. The Stuyvesant community—from teachers to students—will be here for you in this time of distress.</p><p>We have dedicated this issue of the paper to the attack to show our school’s response and to provide an outlet for students. This is not about getting the best story or making waves, this is about representing our school and its experiences in the wake of an event that has affected all of us.</p><p>Countless tasks have gone unappreciated, performed by teachers, administration, first responders, and more. They have stayed up until nearly midnight planning for our safety, and despite being equally impacted by Tuesday’s events, they have carried out the everyday tasks that keep our school running.</p><p>Thank you to Principal Eric Contreras, Assistant Principal of Organization Jeremy Rynders, Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey Pedrick, Assistant Principal of Health and Physical Education Brian Moran, and the countless other administrators who helped organize the school’s response.</p><p>Thank you to the teachers, who waited for us in our classrooms, administered the evacuation, and provided support the next day.</p><p>Thank you to the School Safety Officers and NYPD, who always put our safety, and the safety of the city, before their own.</p><p>Thank you to the counselors and the United Federation of Teachers, who have helped students and staff recover from Tuesday’s tragic events.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has helped us through the past week.</p><p>The Stuyvesant Spectator Editorial Board</p>	Article	258	2017-12-02 06:00:51.577418	2017-12-02 06:00:51.577418
861	﻿Remember, But Don't Remind  <p>An often forgotten aspect of many terrorist attacks and mass shootings is how to deal with their aftermath. Often, these attacks happen in places that are used regularly and serve an essential purpose to a community, such as Sandy Hook Elementary School or the Mother Emanuel Church. Similarly, the attack on the Hudson River bike path is particularly challenging to deal with because it happened in a public, heavily-used area.</p><p>Different places have responded differently to violent conflicts. After the devastation at Sandy Hook, the school was torn down completely and a new one was rebuilt. At Columbine High School, the library—the main scene of the trauma—was rebuilt into an atrium. On the other hand, an Arizona Safeway where six people, including a Congresswoman, were shot reopened just a week later.</p><p>When it comes to the site of last week’s horror, the best course of action is to leave the bike path as is. While it is important that the people who died are remembered, memories don’t have to be set in stone—they will always be in our hearts and minds.</p><p>This is a response of resilience, not amnesia. By showing that Americans will continue to bike up and down the path just as they did before, we demonstrate to terrorists that the people of New York City will not be intimidated. Stuyvesant students will continue to hang out at the scene of this carnage just as they did before.</p><p>By the end of the week after the attack, the heavy media presence in the area and the bouquets of flowers honoring those who perished will be gone. We shouldn't etch the memories of this traumatic incident in stone: creating a constant reminder of the pain people felt on that horrible day helps no one. Students and teachers want to get over this distressing experience, not relive it everyday.</p><p>Instead, we must show how acts of violence will not affect our collective psyche. The bike path reopened the day after the attack, and right away, Citi Bikes were riding down the path.</p><p>The day after the attack, rather than missing school to recover, everyone came in for a mostly normal day of classes. Many teachers did not even feel the need to mention the attack to their students. Ultimately, teachers and students desire a return to normalcy. No one will forget what happened on Tuesday. It will continue to weigh very heavily on my mind. That memory is all we need: the school doesn’t have to erect a monument for us to feel the pain that we all felt on Tuesday.</p>	Article	259	2017-12-02 06:02:18.451789	2017-12-02 06:02:18.451789
862	﻿We Need To Do Better: Challenging Staff Apathy For a school that claims to prioritize its students’ health and safety, the lack of an organized and empathetic response from the staff was disappointing, if not shocking. <p>“Hello everyone! Thank you for your patience! The shelter-in… does continue!”</p><p>A cacophony of groans drowns out the rest of the announcement that projects patronizing gratitude for how incredibly patient we’ve all been.</p><p>“Yo, I heard a freshman got shot.”</p><p>“Apparently four little kids from the elementary school were in the bus.”</p><p>“Did you hear about the lab assistant? What’s his name again?”</p><p>The room buzzes with chatter; some verbalizing updates from uncertain news sources, some on the phone with relatives, some complaining about how hungry they are, and some fidgeting, waiting for an announcement that will confirm or deny the rumors flying, or provide any kind of update at all.</p><p>This announcement is not forthcoming.</p><p>Entering Stuyvesant the next day, I notice the school has a somewhat muted quality to it. Not like the hallways echo less noise, but like someone threw a heavy afghan over us. From time to time, the P.A. blares. Counselors are in the theater. Counselors are in the theater. Counselors are in the theater. We float from room to room, waiting to hear what our teachers will tell us. Waiting for our teachers to guide us in our reactions and responses. Waiting for them to pay respects.</p><p>Many of us are still waiting.</p><p>For a school that claims to prioritize its students’ health and safety, the lack of an organized and empathetic response from the staff was disappointing, if not shocking. During the evening of the West Side attack, the administration’s policy of retaining necessary information would have been appropriate for an elementary school—not so much for a high school full of teenagers and adults with Internet access, social media, and the maturity and experience to understand the implications of a terror attack. This tactic may have been effective 30 years earlier, but not today, when the sheer terror of not knowing is amplified by a plethora of false news reports and frightened gossip. When the majority of the student body is bombarded with rumors and posts and is simultaneously infantilized by the administration, panic spreads—the very same panic the administration had been trying to avoid.</p><p>Even more upsetting was the lack of a collective decision from the staff on how the attack should be addressed in class—despite receiving and ignoring advice from the counseling department on how to broach the issue—which resulted in a variety of teacher responses. Some chose to act blasé, asking at the beginning of class, “Remember, if any of you feel too traumatized or distracted to focus on the lesson, just leave to counseling now… no one?” Others decided that the attacker didn’t deserve the attention of a class discussion and said as much before moving on to the planned lesson, leaving the question hanging in the air: What about the victims? Do they not deserve discussion either? Still others chose to pretend it didn’t happen at all, even having the audacity to administer a quiz the following day. Not all teachers were indifferent—there were teachers, particularly English teachers, who did allow their class to become a space of open discussion and free thought about the attack. It wasn’t until I had English myself that I realized the full absurdity of focusing on coding and equations and imperfect tenses when a literal terror attack had occurred in our front yard not even 24 hours earlier. It was an insult to our intelligence, but more importantly, it was an insult to the memory of the victims of the attack.</p><p>The point is that we’re resilient, right? In fact, we’re so resilient that a single P.A. update on the crisis happening 20 feet from our doors is clearly too much for us kids to handle, so we’re just going to frantically refresh Snapchat in desperate hope that not even one of the rumors is true. We’re not going to let this affect us, so we’re going to isolate this conversation in the theater and ignore it in the classroom. We’re going to trust that the teenagers of a competitive school will choose to seek support on their own in lieu of attending classes they can’t afford to fall behind on, taught by teachers so oblivious and unconcerned one would think they had slept through the past two days. We’re not going to mention eight dead people, or their mourning families, or the news crews colonizing two streets, or the students who didn’t come to school, or the students who really shouldn’t have come to school. We’re so resilient we’ve chosen to set an apathetic example for our students to follow—which many of them did. We’re going to keep moving forward into the same numbness that we criticized in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting—a legacy perpetuated by the staff and carried on by the student body. Somehow, by proving theorems and discussing Andrew Jackson’s contributions and failures during his presidency, we’re supposedly refusing to let “them” win—but the ultimate loss isn’t just ours, it’s that of the grieving families devastated and left unmentioned.</p><p>Of course, there isn’t a way to be prepared for every imaginable crisis. However, a news update and a more coordinated effort toward empathy and respect isn’t a special request, it’s a basic responsibility. If the Student Union can organize a school-wide gesture of respect for the victims of the West Side attack the night before, the staff can pause or postpone their lessons. We’re not asking for perfection, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expect the adults in charge of us to do better—or even, inconceivably, to care.</p>	Article	260	2017-12-02 06:02:51.461113	2017-12-02 06:02:51.461113
865	﻿Politicizing Tragedy Through Social Media  <p>At about 3:00 p.m. on Halloween, Sayfullo Saipov drove a pickup truck down a crowded bike path along the West Side Highway, crashed into a school bus on Chambers Street, and got out of his truck with two imitation firearms. In the process, he killed eight people, and seriously injured 11 more. Shortly after the attack, President Trump tweeted, "In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!" How very like our president: he never misses an opportunity to use his Twitter account as a commentary outlet amidst political unrest, as opposed to holding an organized press conference. After a brief acknowledgment of the victims of the shooting, he continued to use Twitter to push his own agenda forward, showing more biased anger in his tweets than sympathy towards the victims and their families.</p><p>In particular, his xenophobic opinions were made clear. There was a stark difference between his reaction to the white Las Vegas shooting earlier this month and the recent attack by a foreigner. When asked if the man that shot and killed 58 people at a concert was a terrorist, Trump declined to answer. He used his infamous stalling tactics and barely brought up the possibility of his administration tightening gun laws in the future.</p><p>But after this attack by an Uzbek national in the name of ISIS, Trump wasted no time in proposing a new approach to immigration to Congress and the public through social media, proclaiming his desire to get rid of the Diversity Visa that brought Saipov into the United States. He tweeted, "CHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!" (Nevermind the fact that Saipov did not come here through chain immigration and that the people he did bring to the U.S. in this manner have not brought any harm to the country.) Trump acknowledged that there are bills going through Congress about ending chain migration, but asserted that they're being "stopped by Democrats because they're obstructionists."</p><p>In also immediately blaming ISIS for the attack, President Trump took advantage of this tragedy to add to partisan divide. The NYPD and the FBI had barely begun their investigation of the crime scene before he tweeted about refusing to let ISIS return to our country. His comments were clearly motivated by his bias against foreigners and Muslims, making this great tragedy no longer about the victims but about finding new ways to discriminate against these groups.</p><p>He also used this event as a jumping-off point to discuss further controversial matters, such as the death penalty and Guantanamo (which he spoke about in subsequent tweets). For instance, he discussed his annoyance with the justice system we have in place because he didn’t think this "animal" deserved to go to court or receive the leniency he would get (since the death penalty is illegal in New York).</p><p>Through social media, President Trump quickly politicized the tragedy that happened on our school's doorstep and incited arguments about immigration and justice, which effectively took attention away from the victims and the survivors. Instead of uniting our country after the attack, he used his platform to divide us on issues loosely related to the offender. Rather than following his lead, we should stand united, regardless of political differences, following such a tragic event.</p>	Article	263	2017-12-02 06:09:17.340948	2017-12-02 06:09:17.340948
857	﻿Deadly Terror Attack Outside Stuyvesant  <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>Walking across the Tribeca bridge, senior Grace Tang was headed to a doctor’s appointment when she heard a loud crash. Below, she saw the mangled remains of a school bus and an armed man running around. “He came out and he had two guns with him,” Tang said. “That was when I started running back into the school.”</p><p>Sayfullo Saipov drove a Home Depot rental truck down the Hudson River bike path on Tuesday, October 31, before crashing into a school bus in front of Stuyvesant. Eight people were killed and 12 were injured in what became the deadliest act of terrorism in New York City since 9/11. One of those injured was Stuyvesant’s biology lab specialist Dr. Yanjun Zhang.</p><p>The next day, students returned to school, taking a detour around the cordoned-off section of the West Side Highway, the chaotic roar of helicopters and sirens replaced by a solemn stream of high schoolers, dressed in black out of respect for the victims. Tuesday’s attack will have both global and political repercussions, but it has also profoundly impacted the Stuyvesant community.</p><p><b>The Attack </b></p><p>Saipov turned the truck onto the bike path along the West Side Highway near Houston Street at 3:04 PM on October 31 and mowed down bicyclists and pedestrians.</p><p>“We walked up to the bike path and we saw pools of blood, bloodied up jackets, broken bikes with blood on them, people crying, it was something out of a movie almost,” said sophomore Andrew Hirtle, who was at Pier 40 for football practice.</p><p>Four minutes later, Saipov crashed into a school bus parked at Chambers Street. Saipov jumped out of the van, brandishing a paintball gun and a pellet gun. “I was at the mural, near the entrance of the bridge [...] I heard the crash, then we went to look and saw a lot of smoke. Then we saw a man jump out of the van,” freshman Laith Bahlouli said.</p><p>Saipov allegedly began shouting “Allahu Akbar,” Arabic for “God is great.” “He shouted that phrase [...] he screamed ‘Allahu Akbar,’” said freshman Timothy Yen, who was also near the Chambers Street mural during the incident.</p><p>Students and staff ran into the school to alert security about the attack. “I was sitting at the main desk when a substitute teacher, Lisa Erica James, came in and ran to me sitting at the main desk and told me there’s a man outside with a gun. My coworker [Agent] McConnell locked the doors and I started pushing the kids inside the auditorium,” School Safety Agent B. Taylor said.</p><p>As Stuyvesant locked its doors, police officers, who were in the building due to an emotionally distressed student, responded to the attack. “The first thing I saw was the smashed bus,” junior Tobias Zinner said. “I walked further into the street to see what was going on, and then I noticed all the cops next to me were crouched down and had their guns out of their holsters, and they were screaming, ‘He has a gun, he has a gun,’ and then I heard shots fired.”</p><p>Police officer Ryan Nash of the First Precinct fired nine shots, one of which hit Saipov in the abdomen. This effectively ended the attack, and Saipov was rushed to Bellevue Hospital Center.</p><p>Inside, approximately halfway through tenth period and only minutes after Saipov was shot, the administration tried to assess the extent of the attack and immediately began following the NYCDOE’s General Response Protocol (GRP), instituting a shelter-in.</p><p>“I was going from the third floor to the second floor and [saw] from the stairwell by the window that kids were rushing back into school,” Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services Casey Pedrick said. “At that time of day students should be leaving not rushing back in, so I opened the door and said, ‘What happened, what happened?’ and a kid said there was a shooter. So I turned to [Assistant Principal of Organization Jeremy] Rynders and said we have to shelter in. [We] went into his office because he has a [loudspeaker] and I called the shelter-in. And then for the next however many hours, I continued to work the loudspeaker.”</p><p>Faculty and students were instructed to remain inside the building and respond to announcements while conducting business as usual. All staff and students receive training in the GRP through drills that are conducted throughout the school year. “You have to be certified in school-building leadership to become an assistant principal,” Pedrick said. “So there’s that training, but then, schools are required to run drills and have meetings of the BRT, which is the building response team. I also run the crisis team. All the drills that [Assistant Principal of Security, Health, and Physical Education Brian Moran] runs really helps keep what to do fresh in your mind.”</p><p>However, under these circumstances, it became clear that this training did little to alleviate the anxiety of the community: an emotional response to terrorism can’t be taught. “As Pedrick was talking, we heard shots fired. [Computer Science teacher JonAlf Dyrland-Weaver] peeked out the window, and he said that there was a smashed school bus,” senior Adam Abbas said. “We assumed that the noise was the engine popping. Then, we start checking the news. When we found out that it was a shooting, it still hadn’t clicked in my mind.”</p><p>As the shelter-in commenced, Parent Coordinator Dina Ingram sent out an e-mail to inform parents of the active situation that was occurring right outside Stuyvesant and the procedures that were being followed.</p><p>Students in the building began using social media to figure out what had happened, receiving messages through Facebook from friends who were outside, or even watching Snapchat videos from students who recorded the event. Others looked to Twitter and news websites for live updates.</p><p>Despite rumors that Stuyvesant students were hurt and that the school bus had children from P226M, the special education school located within Stuyvesant’s building, the bus was not connected to Stuyvesant, according to Principal Eric Contreras. The injured students are 14 and 17 years old, and P226M serves 18-21 year olds.</p><p>While Pedrick kept announcing that the shelter-in would continue, police officers and FBI agents began circulating the building. “Stuyvesant is a location which offers a conference space with a smartboard, online access, and conference calling. The police requested the use of the facilities to set up an operations hub. The same thing happened during 9/11,” Contreras said.</p><p>With Mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and counterterrorism officials sealing off the conference room to coordinate the investigation, the administration had to work with NYPD to start planning how they would dismiss students in an orderly manner so that they would not compromise the ongoing investigations. “I started working with Moran on a plan to dismiss students while we waited. We knew that Chambers was closed and that multiple blocks of the West Side Highway were closed. We also knew that we didn’t have access to the bridge,” Contreras said. “I asked the staff to set up the CASS [scanner] system so we could make sure that everyone was here.”</p><p>Once the coordinated evacuation began, NYPD sergeants visited each classroom to inform students and staff about the situation and elicit any pertinent information students may have had regarding the attack.</p><p>Meanwhile, the school administration figured out the logistics for students, supplying MetroCards and designating an area in the theater where students could wait for their parents.</p><p>“Once they gave us the go ahead, we dismissed by floors and asked students to scan out,” Contreras said. “We asked teachers to line the road along River Terrace to guide students to the main streets. That was another big moment for me because I saw teachers whose days were supposed to [be] over hours earlier line up in the cold and stay there. It took time to dismiss, but they stayed there.”</p><p>After all the students were safely dismissed, administration stayed at the building until past 11 p.m. in order to plan for Wednesday. “Collaborating with the Chancellor’s office and the Mayor’s office, we decided that we needed to be open the next day. I also took the decision to cancel homework and exams the next day to ease some of the stress,” Contreras said. “We realized that the streets were safe and that there wasn’t an active crime scene so we thought it was best to stay open.”</p><p><b>In The Wake of Terror</b></p><p>Students and parents received an e-mail that night from Ingram on behalf of Contreras, addressing the incident and outlining protocol for the next day. A several-block radius was closed off for police and FBI investigation, and the e-mail included a special map for walking to school. Students were not allowed to go outside during free periods or lunch, and there was no access to the Tribeca bridge.</p><p>“Coming home and realizing what we had gone through and that something awful had happened was really hard,” Abbas said.</p><p>In an effort to reflect on the events, the Student Union began organizing a response. “We asked every student to wear black as a way to pay tribute to the victims of the attack and a symbol of the Stuyvesant community’s unity,” Student Union Vice President Alexa Valentino said.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, Stuyvesant students walked to school along police-barricaded sidewalks. “It’s really weird seeing how the street’s empty, being rerouted. It’s just surreal, knowing what I saw on the news last night actually happened to me and I was there,” sophomore Caitlin Chao said after her Wednesday morning commute.</p><p>At the same time, federal prosecutors began filing terrorism charges against Saipov, attributing the attack to ISIS. Saipov waived his Miranda Rights at Bellevue and had begun detailing his year-long plot to drive south to the Brooklyn Bridge, hoping to ruthlessly murder people on Halloween.</p><p>The DOE and Stuyvesant administration provided several resources to help students and staff cope with Tuesday’s events, including advice from the National Association of School Psychologists’ website, printed and distributed on green papers, that advised teachers on how to discuss the event and help their students cope.</p><p>“We kept the regular counselors in the guidance suite and opened up the theater to anyone who [needed] additional support. We’re also collaborating with an outside agency to get more support for any students who just need to talk to someone about all of this,” Contreras said. A homeroom schedule was implemented in order to make an announcement about the counseling resources.</p><p>Support was also provided for adults. United Federation of Teachers Chapter Leader and statistics teacher Dr. Bernard Feigenbaum worked to get support for teachers, and counseling was available for school safety agents. “Coming back the next day was really - I was overwhelmed, but they brought in counselors, for us as well as you guys which was really good,” Agent Taylor said.</p><p>Some teachers decided it was important to address the attack in class the next day. “We spent a lot of time in most of my classes talking about it, and I am particularly conscious of how difficult it is for our Muslim students for the man who committed this act to have said ‘Allahu Akbar,’ which is a prayer that our observing Muslim students say dozens and dozens of times a day, and it only means good and loving things,” English teacher Katherine Fletcher said.</p><p>For teachers who taught at Stuyvesant during 9/11, it was difficult not to draw parallels. “The feeling was very similar, the sense of some kind of outside threat that quickly became international news,” Assistant Principal of English Eric Grossman said. “We were in the building, getting e-mails and texts from former colleagues, former students, and faculty who were watching live while we were inside. The scale, thankfully, was very different. The sense of participating in something historically can be tragic.”</p><p>In the aftermath of crisis, Stuyvesant students and faculty attempted to resume their routines. “Almost all our students came. We have great attendance for our faculty, but it was better attendance than most days,” Contreras said.</p><p>As students left the building after their extracurricular activities, Saipov was wheeled into a Manhattan federal courtroom, accused of killing eight and injuring 11. Thankfully, Dr. Zhang returned to school on Thursday. The dead include five Argentinian tourists, Hernán Mendoza, Diego Angelini, Alejandro Pagnucco, Ariel Erlij, and Hernán Ferrucci, who came to New York to celebrate their 30-year high school reunion, Belgian tourist Anne-Laure Decadt, New Jersey resident Darren Drake, and Manhattan resident Nicholas Cleves.</p>	Article	255	2017-12-02 05:54:22.506376	2017-12-03 20:08:31.403657
950	﻿Beauties, Beasts, and in Between  <p>The fable of “Beauty and the Beast” first appeared over 250 years ago and has since  become an iconic and beloved fairytale. Bill Condon’s live action “Beauty and the Beast” (2017), Disney’s remake of their 1991 animated version, proves that despite the story’s long history, it is neither old-fashioned nor stagnant. Instead, the tale’s cautionary messages regarding the importance of inner beauty and tolerance make it a timeless classic, providing generation after generation with powerful role models.</p><p>The storyline, despite its infamy, is captivating. While staying true to the original plot, “Beauty and the Beast” is infused with scenes and moments that expand upon the story and solidify its morals, making it grow into a modern fairytale. It focuses more on Belle’s (Emma Watson) independence and capabilities, as she becomes more than a bookworm and changes into a wise and strong-willed figure.</p><p>Emma Watson displays her talent as an actress, as she instills within Belle an internal dignity and resolve that elevates the entire film. At times, she is determined with a steely demeanor, exhibited in defense of her father. At others, Belle displays a softer side, such as when she cares for the Beast (Dan Stevens). Watson is able to present Belle as a multifaceted and evolving individual, while emphasizing the character's defining aspects—her tolerance and potential.</p><p>Belle’s ability and skills are expanded upon within the film as well. Through her actions, Belle displays herself as a self-assured and capable young woman, driven by Watson’s genuine belief in public outreach about the empowerment of women. Rather than focusing on her own alienation within the community, Belle extends a hand to try and invite change, as seen in the scene where she teaches a young girl to read and boldly faces the backlash from her community. We see her as an innovator—laboring, thinking, creating—displaying her self-discipline and drive to be stimulated intellectually. Through small moments in which its characters show dignity in the face of hardship, “Beauty and the Beast” becomes a powerful tool for teaching self-worth and resilience.</p><p>The other characters are no less developed. The film expands upon the Beast’s narrative, revealing more about his difficult family background and showing his depth as a character: how he came to be so cold and disinterested as to warrant such a curse and why he deserved salvation. Though his initial cruelty is more pronounced, behind it lies a man tortured by loneliness, mistrust, abandonment, and despair—a man who can be vulnerable and surrender himself to unconditional and, more painfully, unrequited love. Dan Stevens’s performance is powerful and displays incredible range; ironically, he truly fleshes out the Beast’s character as achingly human. As the relationship between the two title characters develops, the Beast reveals a kindness beyond his cold exterior, brought out by Belle’s faith in him and his devotion to her.</p><p>The relationship between Belle and the Beast is the heart of this movie, and “Beauty and the Beast” is able to mold it into powerfully positive themes that serve as a model for young viewers. It makes a clear distinction between the failures marking the relationship’s rocky start and its progression into true affection. Only when the two are able to overcome their dislike for one another and treat each other with compassion and kindness does true emotion develop, and the importance of looking beyond exteriors is showcased.</p><p>At the same time, the film explores darker themes through Gaston (Luke Evans) and his role in the plot. Though his tremendous ego and superficiality immediately give him away as an unlikeable character, underneath is a truly sinister persona. His manipulative nature is impeccably portrayed as Evans’s face morphs into one of sickening insincerity, and his voice gains a melodic quality not present in its usually deep timbre as he capitalizes on his charm to manipulate the people. He becomes a character not only genuinely frightening, but also hauntingly familiar from a modern perspective, in a film that warns against blindly following charismatic leaders.</p><p>The original movie was widely renowned for its soundtrack, and in this area “Beauty and the Beast” also shines. The vocals in the film are full and powerful, and the musical numbers are endlessly entertaining. While the original songs are done great justice, “Be Our Guest” is nothing short of a breathtaking, colorful musical extravaganza, with endless formation changes and a loud, harmonic chorus.</p><p>The new numbers that are introduced in some ways surpass the originals. “Evermore,” the Beast’s ballad expressing his heartache at Belle’s departure, is not only beautifully executed, but contains a rare sophistication within its lyrics and composition. Dan Stevens’s booming voice fills the grand crescendos with heart-wrenching emotion, simultaneously providing a brilliant musical performance and expanding the depth of his character in a voice that captures true heartbreak.</p><p>The film truly is a sight for sore eyes, with a whimsical set and masterful costumes. Belle’s iconic yellow dress is even more breathtaking in the live action film, with a delicate, flowing skirt that shimmers and makes every movement graceful. Each costume is intricate, and even the minor characters are given attention, as in the opening ball scene where an array of white dresses with intricate lace, each unique, is seen.</p><p>The sets are likewise beautiful, infused with vibrant colors of meadows and Belle’s quaint provincial town, characterized by a modest, but homey design. The graphics allow the film to truly emulate a magical kingdom that is impossible to find in the real world, with the Beast’s imposing yet elegant castle of towers that seems lifelike in spite of the darkness clouding it.</p><p>“Beauty and the Beast” ticks off all the boxes. It is a film that gives and gives, creating an experience that is not only immensely enjoyable but also productive and inspiring. Ultimately empowering in its messages of the perseverance of good and the power lying behind external appearances, it leaves viewers with a sense of lightness and hope, reinforcing the potential within kindness to stimulate change. It provides young viewers with valuable lessons, teaching young girls they are capable and strong and reinforcing the importance of education and making your own decisions. This enlightened, relatable fairytale proves to the world that tradition and progress are compatible, meaningful, and bold, even evoking faith in the lost notion of “happily ever after.”</p>	Article	348	2017-12-24 16:50:14.52267	2017-12-24 16:50:14.52267
954	﻿“InTransit” Takes a Ride Through the New York Experience A review of the Broadway musical InTransit. <p>We all know how important the New York subway system is, as most of us use it to travel the city, including riding to and from Stuyvesant every day. Thousands of passengers board each day from all over, navigating around hundreds of stations across the five boroughs, praying there aren’t any major delays or reroutes that make it harder to reach their destination. “InTransit,” the new Broadway musical at the Circle in the Square Theater, not only uses the subway system as a framing device for its story, but also as the core instrument of the show.</p><p>“InTransit” is the first a capella musical on Broadway, relying solely on the voices of the cast—and occasional banging on the set to provide some percussion—to carry the show’s musical numbers. This works incredibly well, since the cast has a fantastic vocal range that creates a captivating harmony.</p><p>The set resembles a New York City subway (though not any particular one, as there are signs for multiple stations around the set), with a conveyor belt giving the illusion of a train. Set pieces are moved to replicate other locations like a bar or an apartment. The unique nature of the Circle in the Square Theater, where the audience encircles the stage, provides an immersive experience. No matter where the actors are performing, they are always facing some part of the audience.</p><p>A particularly impressive aspect of the show is the sound effects, which are produced by the cast members themselves. The Boxman, for example, is a street performer who opens the show with impressive beatboxing and perfectly imitates sounds necessary for the story, such as the noises of an approaching train. He also monologues about the spirit of the city and helps other characters with their dilemmas, providing a unifying force for the story.</p><p>The show follows several different but tangentially related New Yorkers, all dealing with some sort of relatable turmoil common to citydwellers. Jane, for instance, wants to get out of her dead-end office job and become an actress, but struggles to land her dream role. Nick is recently unemployed and has to haggle with a subway booth attendant when his MetroCard runs out of cash. Ali recently got out of a bad breakup and suffers lonely Saturday nights, battling the urge to contact her ex over social media.</p><p>Though their stories are separate, they are tied together through distant relationships as their paths cross in the city, leading to developments such as Jane and Nick starting a romance. However, none of these feel contrived and instead accurately portray how despite the city’s busy nature, even if the train being on time is more important to us than a conversation, we can still make some surprising connections with the people we meet.</p><p>The most poignant storyline in the show is that of a same-sex couple, Trent and Steven, played by Justin Guarini and Stuyvesant alumnus Telly Leung (‘98), respectively. We see Trent conflicted when he returns to his hometown for a weekend (introducing Steven as a “roommate”) and faces affection from his family, but also has to sit through sermons where a priest condemns his sexuality as “sodomy.” Steven spends most of the story encouraging Trent to come out to his religious, narrow-minded mother, but Trent, understandably, doesn’t want to lose her love. “This is more important than ever!” Steven tells Trent, trying to convince him to marry him to take a stand against bigotry.</p><p>That line holds a lot of weight in our current political climate, and the scriptwriters are aware of it. In light of both the 2016 elections and Leung’s recent wedding to his own husband, James Babcock, the script was altered to be as relevant as possible. It doesn’t come across as preachy or overly political, but the tasteful way it addresses both those who are openly gay and those struggling to come out accurately represents New York’s diversity.</p><p>The cast is appropriately diverse for an urban setting. Anybody who takes the subway can relate to experiences such as constant train rerouting, people urinating on the walls, and panicking because the MetroCard machine ate your last dollar. Yet it isn’t just the misery of the city that’s explored, but also the glory of its hustle and bustle. One number represents this by blending together the noises of the city (e.g. construction work, deli carts, and MTA officers), featuring an actress in a unique dress made entirely of MetroCards in the center of it all. It’s a small set, but it immerses the audience in the city experience.</p><p>“InTransit” is a love letter to New York. Tourists will be able to relate to the characters and enjoy the music, true, but it’s a must-see for anybody who loves the city, even if they hate some things about it. It celebrates how every stranger has a story, and every story needs the city to thrive. The a cappella stylings are a perfect choice for a musical about New York; like the music in this show being made up of the cast’s voices, the mood of the city is defined by the people within it and all of their wild adventures—even when they come face to face with delays and reroutes.</p>	Article	352	2017-12-24 16:54:16.009619	2017-12-24 16:54:16.009619
956	﻿Autistic Kids are Welcome on Sesame Street An overview of “Sesame Street’s” new muppet Julia and how well she represents autism. <p>A new character is moving onto the iconic children’s television show “Sesame Street” this April, and she has lessons for kids who were formerly nowhere to be found. Red-haired Muppet Julia is Sesame Street’s first autistic character.</p><p>Julia was first introduced in an online storybook as part of an initiative on the Sesame Street website. The site encourages visitors to “see amazing in all children” and provides resources teaching about autism and how to raise autistic children, including “daily routine cards,” which detail social behavior and testimonials from autistic people and their families. However, the initial release of Julia was met with some criticism from the autistic community. Some found the usage of “person first language” (saying “person with autism” rather than “autistic person”) patronizing and criticized the usage of testimonials from autistic people’s families over testimonials from autistic people themselves. Many also called out how Autism Speaks—a prominent autism advocacy organization that has faced huge backlash for portraying autism as a disease to be eradicated—was listed as a resource.</p><p>While some of these criticisms are valid, the announcement of Julia officially joining the cast has been received warmly. It is rare for an autistic character to become an official cast member of a major TV show, as they usually only exist for one episode to teach a lesson about autism. The network has stated that Julia will become a recurring member of the main cast of this landmark children’s show; if she is portrayed as a character who happens to have autism rather than a “token” character who only exists to teach about autism, it will be a major step forward for the entertainment industry.</p><p>Julia made her official television debut on April 10, on HBO, but there are also several videos available online featuring Julia, both animated and in muppet form. These videos demonstrate several of her autistic behaviors: flapping her hands (known as “stimming”), delayed responses to her friends, limited speech, and not looking people in the eye. However, she is never demonized for her symptoms. Whenever characters are concerned about Julia’s behavior, Elmo explains politely that Julia is autistic and thus communicates differently from most, and the characters agree and accommodate to her needs when playing with her. Julia’s autistic traits are even put in a positive light in some cases. In one animated short, Julia is playing “I Spy” with Elmo and Abby Cadabby and is able to find the tiny red object that Elmo wants her to because of her strong attention to detail—a common autistic trait. In a live action short, Julia doesn’t respond to Elmo when he asks her to play. Without hesitating, Elmo happily decides to play next to Julia instead and reminds the viewer that “there [are] lots of ways friends can play!”</p><p>Like any other character on the show, Julia is just as quirky as the real children who will watch her on television. While this might not sound too important for a character on a children’s show, in Julia’s case, it’s groundbreaking. By definition, a “token autistic character” exists only for the purpose of being autistic, instead of being a three-dimensional person. Julia may only be a puppet, but she has a three-dimensional personality that comes through in the videos featuring her that have already been released. In one of these clips, Abby Cadabby blows bubbles and reveals that Julia loves popping them. In another, Elmo mentions that Julia’s stuffed animal “Fluffster” is her favorite toy. In both videos, Julia says only a few words—implying that she’s nonverbal. At the same time, her friends are always happy to talk to her. Watching this, children at home can learn that autistic people are complex and internalize the idea that being friends with autistic kids and making an effort to communicate with them when they express themselves differently is not only great, but normal.</p><p>Like other children’s shows, “Sesame Street” is meant to teach young children basic life lessons and skills. Every plotline and character provides some insight into how to learn new things, how to make friends, how to resolve an argument, how to be kind to others, how to shake hands and play with other children, and other common skills. The mainstream media is accepting that knowing how to understand, befriend, and respect autistic people is important—important enough to teach the next generation that, right along with the ABC’s.</p><p>One progressive aspect of Julia that can be easily overlooked is her gender. The fact that Julia is an autistic girl is its own leap forward and can fight common misconceptions about who autism affects. There is a notable lean towards autistic boys and men in the media, and autism is significantly underdiagnosed in women—the original definition of autistic psychopathy by Hans Asperger didn’t even include women or girls as affected. Including more autistic girls in media, like Julia, should be celebrated. It reminds people that autism is not a “boy’s disorder” and lets young autistic girls see themselves represented.</p><p>“Sesame Street” is no stranger to exposing children to reality in a mature fashion. They’ve had episodes dealing with pregnancy and birth, death of a loved one, bullying, poverty, and cultural pride. Julia isn’t even the only groundbreaking character to come to the street this year, as another new Muppet, Alex, has a father in jail, providing support for children with incarcerated family members. Many children’s shows would shy away from these topics, but “Sesame Street” is using its mainstream popularity to take a few risks.</p>	Article	354	2017-12-24 16:55:07.405952	2017-12-24 16:55:07.405952
958	﻿What Really Goes Into Your College Rec Teachers can provide a variety of letters of recommendation for college. Let’s break some of them down. <p>So after 10 hours of preparing a pleading speech and 10 more of on-the-floor begging, your teacher has finally decided to write you a letter of recommendation for college. Congratulations!</p><p>There are a variety of recs that your teachers can write, and it’s important to know which one will be written on your behalf so you know what to expect.</p><p><b>The “Why X” Recommendation:</b></p><p>These recommendations sound a lot like the college-specific supplemental essays you will write.</p><p>Instead of talking about “world-class faculty” and “a diverse student body that partakes in a variety of activities,” your teachers will speak highly of your “frequent contribution to class discussions” and “demonstrated curiosity in the field.” In fact, your teacher probably uses the same template to write the recommendation just like how they use the same handouts from 2004.</p><p><b>The Snake Recommendation:</b></p><p>Snake recommenders aren’t asked by students often, so when they’re asked, they know that you’re desperate to get into college.</p><p>Much like a snake, these teachers will sense your hopelessness and capitalize on it by including everything negative about you. They will include a log of every time you arrived late (with attached late slips), used a phone (with secret photographic evidence), or incorrectly answered a question when they called on you.</p><p>Snake recommenders are initially hard to spot, but once you have a class with one, it becomes very obvious. They will never give points back on a test even when they admit they are wrong, assign group projects on a whim, and try to be funny but actually end up making the entire class uncomfortable.</p><p><b>The Gas Recommendation:</b></p><p>This recommendation is 10 percent luck, 20 percent skill, 15 percent concentrated power of will, five percent pleasure, 50 percent pain, and 100 percent bravado for even considering to ask for a recommendation.</p><p>It’s mostly painful for this teacher to write you a letter of recommendation. You and your teacher both know that you finessed this class as much as you finessed in asking for a recommendation.</p><p>However, this teacher is a bro and isn’t about to do you dirty. Therefore, this teacher will attempt to “gas you up” for college admissions and exaggerate every interaction he/she has ever had with you.</p><p>It’s too bad that colleges will see right through it. It’s too bad that colleges won’t ever see your “whimsical and striking ability to attend class lectures despite being slouched over, snoring.”</p><p><b>The Unicorn Recommendation:</b></p><p>These recommendations are rarer than girls accepting my promposal. If you find a unicorn recommendation, pick the college of your dreams because that will be a college you’ll get an acceptance from (unless it’s MIT).</p><p>Unicorn recommenders are easy to spot.

960	﻿A Eulogy for Obama Barack Obama was a good guy, RIP. <p>We have gathered here today to mourn the death of our beloved #forevermypresident Barack Obama. Obama is more than dearly missed and remains in our hearts forever.</p><p>To fully understand the trajectory of Obama’s life, we have to start from the beginning. A very, extremely, bigly reputable source has long asserted that Obama was born in a small Kenyan village to two devout Muslim, lesbian mothers in the impoverished country of Africa.</p><p>Obama studied by lamplight every night until he fell asleep tangled among his 32 half-siblings, finally writing his way out of his small hut and misery to infiltrate the United States with the sole purpose of becoming its president.</p><p>Obama had his faults—that same reputable source tells us that Obama is solely responsible for the 2008 global recession and that Obama is a race-baiter. But there was something about him: his cheerful disposition would let us know that things were going to get better—no more; now we just cry.</p><p>When Obama departed from our world to the sunny realm of Tahiti, he left a great void behind, a void that would seek to tear apart his very existence. Obama tried to prevail until the very end, but it was just too much for him.</p><p>The majority of us didn’t ask for the fate that came to Obama. But Ohio did. And for some reason that the world has been struggling to understand, Ohio matters. Obama suffered his first fall on November 8, 2017, when we all were desperately trying to refresh Google—because this time, Google wasn’t being funny.</p><p>Obama finally collapsed on January 20, a day marked by the stormy tears of God. Since then, we’ve been warily watching as America becomes q-white an interesting place.</p><p>But we cannot grieve forever. Start studying for that Canadian citizenship test. It’s what Obama would have wanted.</p>	Article	358	2017-12-24 16:56:48.601224	2017-12-24 16:56:48.601224
961	﻿Lights Out Pitching Leads Peglegs to Undefeated Start  <p>Bottom of the first, two strikes, bases loaded, and senior Dean Steinman’s bat at the plate. The opposing pitcher, looking understandably flustered, prepped for the pitch. To his apparent dismay, he was no match for Steinman, and a bloop up the right field line later, the Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity baseball team, had their first lead at 2-0.</p><p>They would ride this momentum to extend their season starting winning streak to three games as they defeated Norman Thomas High School by a final score of 7-2 at Pier 40. “Our bats came alive early and got us going from the start,” senior and co-captain Jack Archer said.</p><p>After taking a 3-0 lead by the end of the first inning, Archer delivered with stellar pitching, which kept the opposition hitless and scoreless until the fifth inning. Meanwhile, in the bottom of the fourth, already up three runs to none, Archer hit a triple to tack on two additional runs onto their four run cushion.</p><p>After six impressive innings from Archer in which he struck out eight batters while walking just two and allowing only three hits, sophomore Jeremy Rubin capped off the win with a solid one-hit, two strikeout inning.</p><p>A highlight of the game was the Peglegs’ success on the defensive side, an area they struggled with last season. “Although I had a rough first inning, my defense helped me get out of it, and we were able to keep the intensity through the remainder of the game,” Archer said.</p><p>The Peglegs are currently atop the AAA Western league at 4-0, highlighted by strong performances in all aspects of the game and victories against formidable opponents.</p><p>Against Newtown, the opening game for the team, the Peglegs showed their potential right out of the gate. They scored nine runs, led by Steinman, who earned a hit on each of his at bats, including a homerun and a triple, and finished with four runs batted in.</p><p>The strength of the pitching staff was in full effect as Archer threw five solid innings, allowing only three earned runs. He was followed by Rubin, who tossed two scoreless innings to close the game.</p><p>In the second game of a back to back, the Peglegs took on the defending AA-level champion Bayside, who was moved up to the AAA level and entered the game coming off a 10-run outing in which they lost despite great hitting. They were looking to get their offense running from the start, but senior Tobias Lange silenced the Bayside offense, throwing a complete game and allowing only one run.</p><p>From the start, it was evident that the work put in during the offseason was paying off. Despite having limited practices and cancelled games due to inclimate weather, the Peglegs have stayed focused, and this has contributed to their active winning streak.</p><p>“I feel that we are very deep in the pitching department and that I trust who ever I put out there. Not many teams can say that,” head coach John Carlesi said.</p><p>However, what has made the Peglegs a significantly improved team from last year is the consistent offense and fielding, areas they struggled in last year. “The first few games of the season have hopefully put down a basis for the team to build on. We have had excellent pitching, fielding, and situational hitting” Carlesi said. “Our defense was stellar [to start the season], a big weakness we had last year. We are only two games in, but I feel that this team has grown very close in the Fall and Winter, and it has shown on the field.”</p><p>Many new faces on the varsity team have made positive contributions to the improved defense. “[Junior] Max Onderdonk and [sophomore] Malcolm Hubbell are two new players [who] have been huge impact players on the defensive side” Archer said.</p><p>A few areas the team will look to improve on going forward is lowering their strikeout rate and putting more balls into play. They emphasize the importance of the fundamental areas of the game and will look to perfect it. “I think the team needs to focus more on ‘small ball.’ Bunting, hit and runs, and hitting behind the runner—these are things that are going to win us games this year,” Carlesi said.</p><p>If the team can improve on these areas during practice and continue their red-hot play, they will certainly be a scary opponent for their division rivals.</p><p>The Peglegs will look to continue their offensive momentum in their next game against the Francis Lewis Patriots, a team that has allowed eight runs per game, on Wednesday, April 19.</p>	Article	359	2017-12-24 16:57:15.637109	2017-12-24 16:57:15.637109
963	﻿Girls’ Badminton Starts Out Strong  <p>With a 5-0 win against Marta Valle High School on Thursday, March 30, Stuyvesant’s girls' badminton team started the season off strong. The match itself was quite relaxed, as Stuyvesant did not feel much pressure.</p><p>Their first match of the season ended in a forfeit because Murry Bergtraum lacked the necessary amount of players to compete. “We considered the game on Thursday the first game and the official start of the season. However, we weren’t anxious because the schools in our division except Seward Park are relatively new to the sport,” junior and co-captain Mickey Yu said.</p><p>The match against Marta Valle seemed like an opportunity for Stuyvesant to experiment and practice.</p><p>Junior Sion Kim began the match playing first singles against Marta Valle's Kashada Harewood. Kim won all three sets with high scores. However, she still saw ways that she could have improved. “Personally, I think that I could have done better, so I’m not exactly proud, but I was confident about winning,” she said.</p><p>In spite of her mistakes throughout the match, Kim played an impressive match, with the sets ending with scores of 21-3, 21-2, and 21-2.</p><p>The second singles match, played by junior Ida Wang against Marta Valle’s Tiavion Hughie, unfolded with a similar result. Though Wang has played the last two seasons as a doubles player and only became a singles player this season, there were no signs during her match that the transition has been difficult. She, like Kim, won all three of her sets, with her smallest margin of victory a comfortable 17 points.</p><p>Stuyvesant’s great results remained consistent throughout the rest of their matches, with newcomer sophomore Keying Wang winning her singles match as well. Her opponent offered a slightly better performance than her teammates, but still did little to prevent Wang from winning, again in three sets.</p><p>Yu and junior Janie Huang, a pairing familiar from last season, continued the team’s dominant performance, beating Marta Valle’s first doubles team of Cyane Huertas and Stefany Rivera. The second doubles match featured sophomore Tracy Chang alongside senior and co-captain Yiqing Hu. Chang and Hu are a rather recent partnership. Though Hu has been a doubles player for three years, Chang is new, switching from playing third singles to second doubles this season.</p><p>Their performance was not without its errors, but despite several missed serves, the pair was able to improve over the course of their match, and they went on to win all three of their sets against Marta Valle's Jalyssa Cintron and Tiffany Hunter, with scores of 21-10, 21-8, and 21-4. Their match concluded Stuyvesant's 5-0 victory.</p><p>The win set a bright tone for the remainder of the season. "We're pretty optimistic about how our season's [going to] be," coach Hugh Francis said. He credited the returning players, a group that includes seven of the last year’s eight starters, for the hopeful outlook he holds for the upcoming matches.</p><p>The team is looking forward to their match against Seward Park High School. Since the addition of badminton to the PSAL, Seward Park has often dominated the division and has become one of Stuyvesant's biggest rivals. They have proven themselves to be formidable opponents in past matches, having won four out of the six matches against Stuyvesant over previous seasons.</p><p>However, Yu maintains that they can bounce back from previous defeats and come out on top. “We were always on par with Seward Park. It’s hard to predict the outcome of the upcoming match against them, but we will try our best,” she said.</p>	Article	361	2017-12-24 16:57:58.323193	2017-12-24 16:57:58.323193
964	﻿Peglegs Dominate The School of the Future Recapping the girls’ handball game against the School of the Future while also analyzing the season so far and looking to the playoffs. <p>As senior and co-captain Joanne “Jojo” Cheng set up to serve the game winning ace for her first singles match against The School of the Future in the sixth floor gym, the other matches had already been won by Stuyvesant players with margins of at least 15 points.</p><p>This is nothing new for the girls’ handball team, the Peglegs, who have not lost a match this entire season. Every game, involving three singles matches and two doubles matches, has resulted in the players from Stuyvesant winning all five matches.</p><p>The game against the School of the Future was just another example of how successful the season has been. Even so, the Peglegs are staying focused on success after the regular season. “We’re used to winning by huge margins, but nonetheless, every game is important for getting into the playoffs. We’ve never been past the second round as long as I’ve coached, but with this senior and junior-heavy team, I’m confident we can make it further this year,” coach Eric Wisotsky said.</p><p>Regular season games seem to not cause a lot of stress for Cheng, who is a three-year veteran of the team. However, even after winning her match 21-4 against the School of the Future with 3 kills, she was critical of her game.“I was messing up my left-handed shots, and otherwise, I would have won 21-1 or zipped [my opponent] out,” Cheng said. This constant self-critique and desire to improve has played a large role in the success of the Peglegs this season and has helped them toward their 3-0 record.</p><p>A lot of intensity was also shown by senior Seo Hyun Park, who played second singles at this game. She was able to shut out her opponent, winning 21-0 with eight aces and two kills. Throughout her game, she was consistently locked in, seemingly giving an even greater effort when she was already winning by 15 points. Similarly, the first doubles pair at this game, consisting of senior Joanne Chung and junior Ariel Huang, only allowed their opponents to score one point the entire match, winning 21-1.</p><p>Playing third singles at this game, senior Vicky Huang won with the smallest margin, yet still finished with an impressive score of 21-6. She leads the team this year with 14 aces. “[I was] regretful that I didn’t win 21-0, as it would be my third consecutive victory zipping my opponent out,” Huang said. She also re-emphasized that even though the regular season is not very difficult and that players get to bolster up their stats, the team is still staying focused. Their next major game is against Laguardia, who have always given the Peglegs trouble.</p><p>Cheng also hopes that the Peglegs will face one of their major rivals, Bayside High School, who have eliminated Stuyvesant from the playoffs more than once. She hopes that this is the season the girls handball team will be able to finally defeat Bayside and reach the semifinals or even finals. Cheng thinks that winning a championship this season might motivate more talented players to join the Peglegs, and the team will be even stronger next year.</p><p>Although Stuyvesant often dominates their division during the regular season, having only one loss in the past three seasons, Bayside and Benjamin N. Cardozo High Schools have consistently eliminated the Peglegs early in the playoffs. Although the team is aware of this, they are doing their best to build up confidence during the regular season, so they will be in the best position heading into the playoffs.</p>	Article	362	2017-12-24 16:58:24.435285	2017-12-24 16:58:24.435285
967	﻿Beasts on Fire with Five-Game Win Streak The Beasts beat Laguardia with a subpar performance, continuing their win streak. <p>Spectators started filling the stands, anxious to see the game between the Beasts, Stuyvesant’s boys’ volleyball team, and the Lions of Laguardia High School on Monday, April 3.</p><p>The game started off badly for the Beasts. Stuyvesant, heavily favored to win, had many missed bumps, serves and hits, and Laguardia quickly took a 6-1 lead. Coach Vasken Choubaralian called a timeout and berated the team for their careless errors, stating that to win, they couldn’t be overconfident. “There were a ridiculous number of [unfocused] errors, like missing serves and missed attacks, that are unacceptable at this point,” he said.</p><p>After the timeout, Stuyvesant came back, still trailing 7-9, but playing much better. After some strong spikes from juniors Justin Chan and Tommy Min, the Beasts took the lead and went up 15-12. Laguardia, who also missed many hits, was unable to bounce back, and Stuyvesant won the first set with a score of 25-16.</p><p>At the start of the second set, members of the Beasts still looked dejected, as they saw the team fail to play at the level they had in the past.</p><p>Junior Shun Bitar was able to give the team a small lead with his jump serves, but the team continued to commit many errors. Despite this, the Beasts were able to claw their way to a 12-5 lead, as even Stuyvesant’s lower level of play proved effective enough, and Laguardia committed even more errors.</p><p>The second set concluded with an impressive point by junior and setter Ray Jones. After one of one of Bitar’s spikes was blocked, Laguardia was left off balance, allowing Jones to shoot the ball into the far corner on the second touch.</p><p>Though they improved their record to 4-0, much of the game was very mediocre compared to the Beasts’ past games. Both teams made a lot of mistakes, mainly service errors, being unable to receive the ball and being unable to hit over. “[This game] was strange because we [had] a really good day on Saturday. We played [a lot of] strong teams and won many games, playing excellent volleyball. Today, we played like a completely different team. I’ve seen them do all these things much much better,” Choubaralian said.</p><p>With that win and a 2-1 victory over High School of Environmental Studies, they have started their season on a five-game winning streak. The first win of their season was an automatic forfeit, as the team from West 50th Street Campus High School failed to show up. The second win of the season came from a matchup against Louis Brandeis, a strong win in straight sets. The third win of the season came from another 2-0 win against High School for Math, Science and Engineering (HSMSE). It gave HSMSE, who is currently in second place in the Manhattan A West division, their only loss of the season.</p><p>The season has not been all smooth sailing for the Beasts. They have lost one non-league scrimmage against Benjamin N. Cardozo High School. Last year, Cardozo High School finished fourth in the PSAL tournament and they currently have a record of 3-0. Although the scrimmage will not affect the Beasts’ placement, teams like Cardozo could keep the team from advancing far in playoffs.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Jackson Deysine believes that the team always has the ability to do better. “The bounce back from scrim losses will really come from playing smarter as a team. Volleyball is [about] playing the ball intelligently, so I know that if we read the court better, we can easily win games against teams we lost to,” Deysine said.</p><p>Over the past few games, the juniors have helped the team in many ways. Much of the team’s starting lineup is made up of juniors, so they have come to make up a crucial part of the rotation. Jones is the starting setter with middle hitter Nick Kim. Additionally, Bitar, Chan, and Min are strong outside/opposite hitters, which give the Beasts good depth and options to rely on.</p><p>“The juniors are really the core of the team. The chemistry is almost there. Looking forward to next year, it’s reassuring to know that not much will change, and it will be mostly the same lineup,” Chan said.</p><p>The Beasts will be looking to use their practices to improve on their subpar performances. They need to work on forcing other teams to make errors instead of committing unforced errors themselves. With an undefeated record despite their mistakes, the season is looking bright for them moving forward.</p>	Article	365	2017-12-24 16:59:28.956539	2017-12-24 16:59:28.956539
975	Kern No Longer Working at Stuyvesant  <p>Machinist Kern Levigion was dismissed from his position as a provisional worker at Stuyvesant on Wednesday, May 6. He worked at Stuyvesant for 23 years, assisting the janitors in maintaining technological equipment. Levigion was notified on Wednesday, April 22, by the Department of Education (DOE) Human Resources Department that in response to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to remove all provisional employees across the city, his services at Stuyvesant would no longer be needed.</p><p>This proposal by the de Blasio administration addresses the fact that many provisional employees have been on the city’s payroll for years without having passed a civil service examination. Levigion is said to be among the DOE’s 4000 provisional employees who have been affected due to a lack of certification.</p><p>Levigion was viewed as a necessary part of the staff by the student body because he facilitated student run productions such as SING! and the Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)  in their efforts. “He was sort of an enigma. He basically did a bunch of odd jobs around the school that no one else knew how to do. I'm not sure how we're going to do some of those things anymore,” senior Thomas Perskin said.</p><p>Additionally, students have voiced their concern for Levigion and outrage at the city’s action. “As someone who knew Kern personally, I'm really upset,” said junior Annebelle Gary, who has worked closely with Kern in the technological aspects of SING! and STC. “I would love to see him get his job back and I am going to do anything I can to help him.”</p><p>This is not the first time Levigion's job has been at risk. In 2011, the title of machinist was to be removed by the DOE, and Levigion along with 13 other DOE employed machinists were to be laid off. In response, students signed a petition contesting this decision. Levigion was soon rehired by the administration after the discovery that two other mechanists had retained their jobs.</p><p>There has been speculation about other possible reasons for his dismissal. “The official statement is that the decision was made due [to a] personnel issue, done on the level of the human relations department. I can only give you this one statement,” Assistant Principal of Guidance Casey Pedrick said.</p><p>  </p><p>          Levigion declined to speak with The Spectator on the matter, but is believed to be taking steps towards reclaiming the position he held.</p>	Article	373	2017-12-28 19:55:06.510722	2017-12-28 19:55:06.510722
976	Four-Digit IDs to be Discontinued Starting Next Year  <p>The use of Stuyvesant-assigned four-digit student identification (ID) numbers will be discontinued starting with the 2016-2017 school year. Instead, DOE-assigned nine-digit OSIS numbers will be used as students’ primary identification numbers. This is aligned with the implementation of eSchoolData (eSD), the data management and communication software that replaced Daedalus, or “Student Tools.” Concerns have arisen as to whether the use of OSIS numbers will be an efficient alternative after years of reliance on four-digit ID numbers to organize student records.</p><p>Before four-digit IDs were created, computers were not yet used for data management. When former Assistant Principal of Technology Steve Kramer created the Daedalus software, he instilled a customization that formed four-digit IDs with the program. Due to their short lengths and compatibility with Daedalus, four-digit ID numbers have provided a more convenient way of student identification and data management for Stuyvesant. Currently, four-digit IDs are used in the library to keep track of borrowed books, as well as for attendance and grading records.</p><p>Despite this convenience, four-digit IDs have caused structural errors. In the past, four-digit IDs were re-assigned upon graduation. Occasionally, there would be duplicates or other mistakes in ID assignment. In order to avoid these mistakes, the class of 2019 was assigned four-digit ID numbers beginning with the number five instead of recycling last year’s seniors’ ID numbers, which began with the number one. “There was a consensus among [the administration] that four-digit IDs cause complications at times,” Principal Jie Zhang said.</p><p>However, the decision to use OSIS numbers as the primary form of student identification was not a choice made by the administration. Kramer decided that he would discontinue Daedalus in July 2015. Hence, his decision forced Zhang to sign a new contract with eSD, a DOE system intended to work with students’ OSIS numbers.</p><p>The potential inefficiency of OSIS numbers for conducting hands-on administrative tasks is a concern among the school community. “At an operational level, OSIS numbers are less efficient. However, eSchoolData does not have the function to support four-digit IDs. I like the four-digit, but moving forward, we cannot ask this vendor to modify their program specifically for us,” Zhang said.</p><p>Many student-run clubs and publications rely on four-digit IDs to keep track of their members’ activity. ARISTA, for example, uses four-digit IDs to keep track of members’ credits. “Our credit spreadsheet is public for all members of the organization, so we list credits with four-digit IDs instead of actual names to protect members’ privacy,” ARISTA President Ariel Levy said. A similar problem affects other large clubs like Red Cross, which also uses a public spreadsheet to keep track of members’ volunteer hours. “[A] possible solution would be to create our own ID number system,” Levy said. She also acknowledged that OSIS numbers could replace four-digit IDs.</p><p>Despite the connection between OSIS numbers and the DOE, using them in such public spreadsheets does not pose a risk to student privacy. “OSIS numbers and four-digit IDs are interchangeable. Knowing a student’s OSIS number does not mean you have access to their records,” Zhang said.</p><p>Interaction with the DOE will be easier with the use of OSIS numbers. “We [the programming office] prefer that [eSD] uses OSIS numbers because when we work with students’ data, the Department of Education only recognizes OSIS numbers,” Programming Chairperson Joy Hsiao said. Before the predominant use of OSIS numbers, the programming office had to follow the procedure of individually merging four-digit ID numbers with OSIS numbers.</p><p>The replacement of four-digit IDs will change the organizational structure of Stuyvesant, which is something that both students and the staff will have to adjust to.</p>	Article	374	2017-12-28 19:55:50.922557	2017-12-28 19:55:50.922557
978	SLT Meeting Sparks Discussion over Pedrick’s Position  <p>“More than simply helping me out as Student Union President, Ms. Pedrick has been there for every chaotic moment of my life. She saved me from my own self. ” —Ares Aung, SU President</p><p>“We support the functions and personnel in college, guidance, and other pupil personnel services under [Pedrick’s] direction. [We] are against rash changes that would result in great reductions in those areas.” —Wai Wah Chin, Senior SLT Parent Representative</p><p>Student Union President Ares Aung posted a petition on Facebook on Thursday, October 1, entitled, “What Pedrick Means to Stuy.” The petition stated, “Two anonymous faculty advisors proposed to strip [Pedrick] of her position as a result of her interim status, at the Student Leadership Team meeting on September 30th, 2015.” Principal Jie Zhang, however, has said that while Casey Pedrick may not become the official Assistant Principal of Personnel Services—the position she now occupies is considered “interim,” or temporary — Pedrick is likely to retain her position.</p><p>This discussion over Pedrick’s position began when United Federation of Teachers Chapter Leader and math teacher Bernard Feigenbaum proposed to reduce the number of Assistant Principals of Administration from four to three at the School Leadership Team (SLT) meeting in order to hire a new staff member. Math teacher Melissa Protass also described current problems with class sizes that a new teacher could resolve. Principal Jie Zhang responded that the only way to do so would be to eliminate the position of Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services, currently occupied by Pedrick, because it is the only one of the four positions that is not permanently filled.</p><p>Zhang clarified that her comments during the SLT meeting did not mean that she agrees with either side. “I simply stated the facts, the conditions that there need to be in order to have fewer Assistant Principals,” Zhang said. Pedrick declined to be interviewed on the topic.</p><p>There are four administrative positions because in 2012, due to a request by the Department of Education, Zhang increased the number of Assistant Principals of Administration from three to four by hiring Assistant Principal of Safety and Security Brian Moran. “It was right after the cheating scandal, and I thought that we needed a new position to handle everything.  Now that it’s been several years, we don’t need a full-time person to have the position, so I combined [Moran’s] duties with the Assistant Principal of Health and Physical Education.”” Zhang said.</p><p>Normally, interim-acting assistant principals hold their unofficial statuses for half a year before being appointed officially or dismissed. However, Pedrick’s case is special, because Pedrick could not be officially appointed to her position until Assistant Principal of Technology Services Randi Damasek’s case was settled. “It has to do with the fact that Damesek was undergoing investigation [regarding the cheating scandal], and her case was not closed. This caused a personnel issue,” Zhang said.</p><p>Now that Damasek has returned, Zhang released a posting for the official position of Assistant Principal of Pupil Personnel Services. “Pedrick and other candidates have applied, and in theory, the school can choose to appoint someone else,” Zhang said. “However, the position is not hers [until] she is appointed.”</p><p>The majority of the SLT Parent Representatives want Pedrick to retain her position. “We support the functions and personnel in college, guidance, and other pupil personnel services under [Pedrick’s] direction. [We] are against rash changes that would result in great reductions in those areas,” Senior SLT Parent Representative Wai Wah Chin said.</p><p>In a separate interview, Aung said that he showed Zhang the petition to make Pedrick an official assistant principal. “Nothing really changed. The Chancellor’s Regulation 30 (C-30) [the process to select a new assistant principal] is still happening, so that’s good,” Aung said.</p>	Article	376	2017-12-28 19:57:12.967858	2017-12-28 19:57:12.967858
980	﻿We’re All Mad Here To examine how the portrayal of mental illness in pop culture affects our perceptions and mentalities. <p>Elizabeth Woolridge Grant was dressed plainly in a blue shirt and jeans. She didn’t look like she belonged in some of the clubs and bars where legends like Lady Gaga and Jay Z started their careers. Not many of us even recall hearing about the album created by Lizzy Grant, this young girl who spoke quietly despite her robust voice.</p><p>That’s because fame didn’t happen for Grant, but fame did happen for someone called Lana Del Rey, a name associated with mysterious and seductive sadness. Yet, Grant and Del Rey are the same person. However, Del Rey’s persona is nothing like Grant’s. It isn’t simply Del Rey’s soaring vocals and seedy self-styled videos that set her apart from Grant, but her ability to use depression as a publicity strategy.</p><p>In a recent interview with The Guardian, Del Rey was quoted saying, “I wish I was dead already,” and this became the headline. This incited discussion about whether Del Rey’s words were simply a reflection of how she felt or a statement that crafted her image.</p><p>Regardless of her motivations, her discussion of mental health has become a double-edged sword. Many attribute the new dialogue about mental illness to such media recognition. Yet, at the same time, the media itself is creating the very ignorance and stigmatization we are working to break down.</p><p>What is most daunting about the media’s depiction of mental illness is how it is marketed and characterized. Oftentimes, we associate the mentally ill with traits like violence, irrationality, and a blatant disregard of personal space.</p><p>“Orange is the New Black” (2013-present) character Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren is a female inmate who lacks social skills and suffers from emotional outbursts. Despite the television series being based on a true story, “Crazy Eyes” is depicted extremely different from her real life inspiration.</p><p>Unlike the woman on whom she is based, not only does “Crazy Eyes”  have stereotypical traits that we commonly associate with mental illness, but she’s also presented as a black woman, while her real life inspiration is Caucasian.</p><p>At first glance, it is very easy to dismiss “Crazy Eyes” as comedic relief within the cutthroat environment of Litchfield Penitentiary, but simultaneously, her name alone portrays the stigmatization of mental illness that has become inherent in pop culture. Reflecting on how she is constantly misunderstood and viewed as inferior, Crazy Eyes says, “I should have answered the questions in the reverse of how I felt. The opposite of me is better.”</p><p>All too often, not only do we label the real-life mentally ill with negative characteristics because of the media's portrayal, but we heavily stereotype mental illness by visualizing the mentally ill as disproportionately African American.</p><p>This racialization of mental illness, which has been encouraged by the media, historically had profound effects on already oppressed and marginalized communities by delegitimizing protests against oppressive social structures. For example, with the end of slavery, schizophrenia diagnoses increased among the black community, not because the members were at any increased risk for the disease, but because mental illness was used as a weapon to continue to dismiss people of this community. Today’s media must take into account how drastically the racialization of mental illness can affect minority groups.</p><p>The media frequently portrays women with mental illnesses as intent and conscious of their choices. Their actions are often portrayed as malicious rather than stemming from an illness in which the audience should sympathize with. However, at the same time, men with almost identical traits are often portrayed as admirable protagonists who are conquering their illness.</p><p>In the film “Gone Girl” (2014), when Amy Elliot Dunne marries Nick Dunne, her life seems to be finally shaping up. Yet, when Amy finds that Nick is cheating on her, she puts her grand scheme for retaliation in motion.</p><p>Amy’s character represents the skewed social attitudes about mental illness and women because no one can really pinpoint whether she suffers from narcissistic personality disorder or if she is simply a woman scorned. Either way, Amy is presented as a psychopath who remains unconcerned by how her actions affect anyone around her as long as she is still cast in the spotlight. Despite her husband Nick’s infidelity and abuse, the viewer often is sympathetic to his situation, while easily disregarding Amy’s pain and motivation.</p><p>When mentally ill white males are depicted in pop culture, their personalities are viewed as relatable to the human condition. White males have been cast for roles from serial killer Dexter to beloved stockbroker Jordan Belfort, and both are highly intelligent and exude charisma.</p><p>In another instance, Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film “Psycho” (1960) presents Norman Bates, a schizophrenic white man who can only be described as creepy and scary. Yet, mentally ill white males who are presented in pop culture with these negative traits are treated as outliers and specified cases, and these traits are viewed as not intrinsic because of their gender or race.</p><p>That said, mental illness is not always portrayed in a negative light in pop culture. Lana Del Rey sculpts suicide as a romantic and ethereal experience as she croons in “In the Sun,” “Baby, couldn't stop, it was suicide/ Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide.” Such glamorous lyrics have teens yearning to have a disorder, especially depression.</p><p>Yet what the media often fails to present is that depression isn’t solely overwhelming emotions of angst, but can feel like nothing. The media takes the terror out of mental illness. Of course, we shouldn’t regress to a state where mental illness is a taboo, but we do need to become aware of the depth and many faces of mental illness, instead of allowing it to remain behind the pictures of pills that are tagged “#beautiful,” “#softgrunge,” and  “#romantic” on our Tumblr dashboards.</p><p>The next time we engage with pop culture concerning mental illness, it is important that we take note of how it depicts these circumstances and who it depicts. At the end of the day, our discussion oftentimes reinforces or resists the stereotypes and stigmas surrounding mental illness. We must reject our ideas about mental illness and truly educate ourselves on mental illnesses and the very real effects they have on lives.</p><p>Similarly, both casting directors and celebrities alike must think about whether their actions are furthering the romanticization and stereotypes that surround mental illness. Singers like Del Rey need to understand that their audience is comprised of teenagers, who are often blindly trying to emulate the words, choices, and actions of their musical idols, without truly understanding the consequences that follow.</p>	Article	378	2017-12-28 20:35:20.07693	2017-12-28 20:35:20.07693
869	﻿The Media’s Right to Capture Our Reactions The media has a right to ask students about their experiences during the attack on Tuesday. <p>What is the media’s main purpose? To inform and share experiences with the public—whether they’re from the United States, South America, or Europe.</p><p>People from around the country and across the world rely on the media to catch up on important events and to get educated on topics, but they can’t do that if they don’t have accurate news from reliable and primary sources.</p><p>The media provides us with the latest news, and without it, many would be lost.</p><p>“If the media wasn’t allowed to ask the students questions, there wouldn’t be a job for reporters. It is their duty to get the freshest information and spread it,” senior Joelle Lum said.</p><p>Especially with the whole spectacle of “fake news,” it’s hard to find out what actually happened on that horrid night. After only an hour had passed since the attack happened, there were already articles claiming that Stuyvesant students had been killed.</p><p>However, while we now know a majority of the immediate articles were either exaggerations or straight-up false, no one knew what was happening at the time, and as people read those articles, they became more fearful. That’s exactly what terrorists want—to instill fear and to interrupt our daily lives.</p><p>Because we don’t want these false headlines spreading, the only way to get authentic news is from the people who actually saw the event unfold. And some of those people happen to be Stuyvesant students.</p><p>In asking students about the event, there is also the possibility of obtaining new facts on the attack. One student may have seen something that the NYPD hasn’t picked up on, and that bit of missing information could perhaps help the ongoing investigation into the sudden attack on Tuesday.</p><p>If students were more open to talk about the event, they would create a less tense and more united environment. When people turn on the news and watch students continuing with their daily routines, it’s empowering, and it shows that the terrorists weren’t able to achieve their goal of instilling fear in the public. A student may have a very different story to share—one that can inspire others to stand up or teach others what to do while there is an attack.</p><p>Students can not only get through to adults but also to the scared younger kids in nearby schools affected by the attack. Students can show them that they are not alone in this and that other people are going through the same thing as they are, which can be super helpful and influential.</p><p>I’m not saying that reporters should continuously hound students who don’t want to be on the news. Obviously, if you are uncomfortable in the presence of cameras and reporters, you have every right to tell them to not film you, and they should respect you and your decision. However, reporters asking students to express their thoughts on Tuesday’s act of terror is not directly an attack on us.</p>	Article	267	2017-12-02 06:22:03.923933	2017-12-02 06:22:03.923933
870	﻿In Remembrance We put up monuments after atrocities ranging from the Battle of Gettysburg to the Vietnam War to the Oklahoma City Bombing, not to normalize the pitfalls of humanity, but to commend the plight of all the Americans who suffered. <p>Amidst the excitement of the chilly Halloween afternoon, two friends and I marked the end of our school day by photographing our extravagant costumes. I assumed the role of photographer, laughing at their silly poses while facing away from the West Side Highway.</p><p>Moments later, their wide smiles wilted into looks of sheer terror. I heard a loud crash behind me, and I turned to see body lying atop a crumpled bicycle. As the screams of bystanders sent shivers down my spine, I realized the immediacy of the situation. After finding shelter in a lobby, we sat for what what felt like an eternity under strict lockdown, with the doorman updating the body count every hour.</p><p>It emerged later that we had experienced a confirmed act of terror. Saifullo Sapov, an Uzbek immigrant turned radical, murdered eight innocent civilians after careening a truck down a bike path in Lower Manhattan. This tragedy hit close to home for the Stuyvesant population. Some students witnessed the attack firsthand.</p><p>In the difficult days following, students and administrators have debated how we can properly memorialize the attack. Some claim that commemorating such events would only serve as a constant, physical reminder of the horror we seek to forget.</p><p>However, we cannot deny that there was an attack. If the people most closely affected by this atrocity deem it forgettable by not erecting a monument, there is less motivation to prevent similar attacks in the future. Without attributing a plaque or monument, Stuyvesant sends the message that we’ve stopped discussing what we can never really forget. While the media promotes discourse for several days after the attack, spurring legislators and local authorities to act while fear still lingers, there is less public urgency as the massacre grows less recent. A monument will remind anyone who passes by of the vitality of change at a time where tragic attacks happen, and, if nothing is done, will continue to happen.</p><p>Some members of the Stuyvesant community argue that commissioning a monument would defy our defiant “business as usual” attitude. Marking the landscape impedes the normalcy of life afterwards. But that’s exactly the point: it isn't normal to have such a massive loss of life. It isn’t normal when we know the perpetrator’s life story but not the name of a single victim.</p><p>It’s crucial to call out these events as abnormal for the civilized, compassionate nation we aspire to be. We put up monuments after atrocities not to normalize the pitfalls of humanity, but to recognize the Americans who suffered. Their experiences will be normalized if we disregard this sentiment.</p><p>Therefore, we owe it to the victims of the latest terror attack to memorialize them. Their names and stories should stand out for years, even after the hype and urgency subsides. Moving on as a nation, as a school, and as individuals isn’t equivalent to repressing our memory of the attack.</p><p>The monument shouldn’t overwhelm the landscape (just as this horrific tragedy didn’t overwhelm our school), but it must certainly be present. The profundity of being so near a threat has affected us all. A monument would be a physical manifestation of this mindset: it could’ve been anyone that afternoon, so we must work toward it being no one ever again.</p><p>The following Wednesday after the attack, the hallways were overwhelmed with with students clothed in black. Friends gave each other reassuring hugs; hopeful smiles were flashed on escalators. Classes resumed as usual with remarkably high attendance rates. An otherwise tragic incident brought forth the spirit of our student body as we united for another typical school day.</p>	Article	268	2017-12-02 06:23:54.41265	2017-12-02 06:23:54.41265
872	﻿Photography in Terrorism: An Exploitation A think-piece about the role media photography has during terrorism—specifically, how it exploited Stuyvesant students’ “private sphere” and serves unjust issues like Islamophobia. <p>On the evening of Halloween, room 629 was a frustrating scene. My classmates crowded around the leftmost window, squinting their eyes at the only visible sliver of a damaged school bus (I sat back trying to finish my physics homework), when I realized what I had left at home: my camera.</p><p>All I wanted was a single shot of the window. Articles were telling us that two people were dead, which quickly turned into four, then eight, and it was all somewhere close by, outside that window.</p><p>For me, photography has been a way of understanding moments after they happen and of looking at a scene and highlighting the most intimate and meaningful things within it. It’s not always about capturing tragedy, beauty, or people in conflict. What truly matters about a photograph is simply its mood and its message, and it can convey those things in seconds.</p><p>The most recent attack has brought the role of photography in terrorism to the forefront, and it shows us how the media has abused photography’s true purpose. Rather than releasing images that should capture the strength and unity that our city must exhibit, they’ve instead taken photographs that exploit the Stuyvesant student body and the international community. And at its worst, this can only heighten feelings of fear and chaos.</p><p>On the night of the attack, Stuyvesant was surrounded by vans and trucks of several media companies that turned the streets of TriBeCa into photographer-and-reporter galore. As students walked down the moderated path leading towards train stations, many of us noticed the press all around—specifically, the men and women that were trying to take photos of us as we passed. Many of my friends and I covered our faces from the flashbulbs. We did not ask to be photographed, and we did not want to be.</p><p>Even the next day, a photographer had his camera pointed at such an obscure detail as our shoes, recording us all as we walked past him.</p><p>Be it a staff member or student, everyone at Stuyvesant experienced the attack either directly or indirectly, and the feelings that we have about it may be extremely personal. However, when media companies take photos of us without our consent, they bring our own private spheres out into the public. They violate our comfort in a place where we should feel motivated to learn. These are not simply individual headshots of a student or two; they are large-scale depictions of our student body.</p><p>Terrorism is meant to incite fear, but a photograph showing that all Stuyvesant students are frightened and nervous victims does not tell the truth: we are indeed shocked, but not weak.</p><p>The first photograph of Sayfullo Saipov (the Uzbekistani man who committed the attack) was released on the night it happened. His dull mugshot was the icon of nearly every single news channel that night. The most troubling part about this photograph is how little important information it gives us; all we see is the color of his skin and the fact that he has a long, black-haired beard—nothing else.</p><p>I don’t believe that releasing his picture to the general public will benefit anyone. The only purpose of this photograph should have been to help keep his face recorded on a federal level. Past that, it allows us to unconsciously group together a skin color with Islam or a beard with terrorism. The reality, however, is that there is no such facial feature as the “Islamic” kind. Slowly but surely, the photograph of Saipov contributes to sweeping generalizations about millions of Muslim people across the world. At this point, Islamophobia worsens at all costs.</p><p>Consider political activist Laura Loomer, who enraged the twittersphere when she posted pictures of two hijabi women walking on Chambers Street and blamed them for simply being in the area where the attack happened.</p><p>Photographs in the media are full of ideas and messages that we sometimes digest without even an ounce of conscious thought. Nonetheless, they are effective. A photograph should be a positive change in and of itself. But reporters and the media only seem to want to capture the grim and the grit, and this is the seemingly unfixable problem.</p><p>In a week from now, the media might be scrambling to tell another more “important” story. By then, the violent attack on our community will likely just become old news, tangled within a jumble of exploitative photographs, thousands of news articles, and Islamophobic media.</p>	Article	270	2017-12-02 06:24:10.524496	2017-12-02 06:24:10.524496

I don't have interesting breakfasts, nor do I have anything interesting to say about breakfast, and I'm bringing that idea home right now.</p></p><p><h4>Polazzo, Government Teacher and Coordinator of Student Affairs</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>Nothing</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I don't believe in breakfast. That is to say, people always say, "breakfast is the most important meal of the day," but there's very little science to actually back that up. And if you like to eat breakfast, that's fine, but some of us prefer to skip that meal. I am one of those breakfast skippers, and I feel that my life is much better for it. So, no breakfast for me. Down with breakfast! I mean, I'm joking. You can have breakfast if you want, but I don't want any.</p></p><p><h4>Fletcher , English Teacher </h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>A cup of iced coffee with milk</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>You should eat when you get hungry, which, for me, is usually not until like 10 a.m. </p></p><p><h4>Camille Sadoff, Sophomore</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>For breakfast, I ate nothing.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I don’t think breakfast is necessary for anyone. I get along fine without it. Unless you have something really important to do in the morning, like physical activity or a test, then breakfast is not necessary. I don’t like eating in the morning, and it takes too much time, so I’d rather sleep than eat breakfast.</p></p><p><h4>Min Sun Yu, Freshman</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I usually eat something different every day—it's usually with rice because I am Asian. I also really like eggs, and I have eggs a lot.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>It is really important to vary up what you eat or else you get bored and don't want to eat anymore.</p></p><p><h4>Shan Mei Kong, Sophomore</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>Dumplings</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>You should eat breakfast every day.

It's far worse and far less productive to be in school when you are fatigued and distracted because you haven't eaten—or slept for that matter! Not only does breakfast physically switch on all of your systems in the morning, but it's also the emotional and mental commencement of the day as well. Everyone should eat breakfast! </p></p><p><h4>Leah, Junior</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>Smoothie with two medium sized bananas, spinach, peanut butter, half of an acai packet, and coconut milk. Coffee with almond milk and pumpkin spice creamer.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>My breakfast philosophy? Go vegan or go home! At least for me, but anyway, usually in the morning I crave fruit because I'm very thirsty and it's really hydrating and it is a really good way to start off your day. So I am definitely an advocate for eating breakfast because it gives you a lot of energy. And of course, lots of coffee helps with that energy boost!</p></p><p><h4>Dawn Vollaro, Math Teacher</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I am really bad about breakfast. I had milk, orange juice, and I had two litte Drake's apple pies. Breakfast is not my thing. This just goes back to when I had to commute to my high school; I just had to throw something down my throat and get out and go on the train, so it has to be fast. And I'm still commuting, to get to Stuyvesant, so it has to be fast. It's not good, but I can't commute on an empty stomach, so it has to be something.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I believe in breakfast. It's not my favorite meal, but if, you know, someone was making me a nice French toast with scrambled eggs, I would like it. I just don't have time for it. I wish I did, but I'm too busy in the morning, so I just eat something, and then I'm out the door.</p></p><p><h4>Marianne Prabhu, Biology Teacher</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>Today, I had a large cup of coffee, with half a Splenda in it, followed by a chocolate-covered Oreo. Most days, I usually have a large cup of coffee, but today, I snuck in the chocolate-covered Oreo.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I probably should have a better breakfast, but I don't. It's just coffee. I would have a two-egg omlette every morning, if I could.</p></p><p><h4>Barbara Garber, Health Teacher</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I have coffee for breakfast and a glass of water. Usually, I have a slice of oatmeal raisin bread with a little almond butter. Sometimes, I have cereal with some kind of low-fat milk. Then, I usually have a piece of fruit around 10 a.m.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>Some people say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. However, there are some people that really can't eat much in the morning. If I have something, I've usually been up for an hour and a half, at the very least. I can't eat first thing when I get up and I can't really eat a big breakfast.</p></p><p><h4>Christine Cabusay, Freshman</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I ate a piece of bread.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>If you're running late, you don't need it.</p></p><p><h4>Lara Somoroff, Freshman</h4></p><p><p><b>What did you eat for breakfast?</b><br/>I had avocado toast.</p></p><p><p><b>What is your Breakfast philosophy?</b><br/>I don't like to eat too much because it makes me feel heavy.

Only 4.5 percent of students went to private school, while even fewer students went to parochial school. Home-schooled students formed a minority at 0.1 percent.</p><p>The majority of students who attended a selective public school were white (64.3 percent), while the majority of students who attended zoned public schools or parochial schools were Asian.</p><p>While most students (27.9 percent) studied for the SHSAT six months to a year before the exam, a surprising 21.2 percent of students studied for over a year. Only 4.1 percent of students did not study.</p><p>The majority of students who studied for over a year were Asian, while the majority of students who did not study were white. The students who prepared for the most time were largely from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, while the students who prepared for the least amount of time were largely from upper middle class backgrounds, possibly because they had the option of going to prestigious private schools.</p><p>The incoming class largely utilized preparatory classes to study for the SHSAT.

982	﻿Unprecedented Presidents: Uncontested Tickets for Senior Caucus and Student Union  <p>Student Union (SU) candidates Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino and Senior Caucus candidates Pallab Saha and Abie Rohrig ran uncontested, perhaps out of respect or perhaps out of fear; both tickets wielded formidable experience and accolades.</p><p><h4>Pallab Saha and Abraham Rohrig — Senior Caucus</h4></p><p>“We took [running uncontested] as a sign that the Class of 2018 really trusts us and that just motivates us to do more for them,” Saha said. Their platform reflects this drive and speaks to their previous successes in the Junior Caucus.</p><p>This year, Saha and Rohrig not only understood the importance of aiding the juniors’ college search, by developing close ties with the Alumni Association and selling preparatory books in the school store, but also focused on counteracting grade-wide apathy with a Pep Rally.</p><p>However, they are aware that the roles they needed to assume as the Junior Caucus differ from those they will have to as the Senior Caucus. “[After] senior year, we are leaving behind all the memories we’ve made,” Rohrig said. “The Senior Caucus makes sure a grade identity is formed.”</p><p>Saha and Rohrig have divided their platform into four major components: leaving a mark, moving on to the next chapter, reinforcing school spirit, and embracing senior year.</p><p>In order to leave a mark, Saha and Rohrig will revitalize the Mnemonics Public Art Project, commonly known as the Memory Cubes. “We want to reach out to [Principal Eric] Contreras and [Assistant Principal of Security, Health, and Physical Education Brian] Moran so that the Class of 2018 has a say in what goes into our memory [cube],” Rohrig said.</p><p>They also aim to begin mentoring underclassmen caucuses and collaborating closely with the SU. “I think that a problem within the SU this year has been a lack of communication between the caucuses and the SU, and there have been a couple of instances where this has happened,” Rohrig said. “The SU only has a certain amount of political capital, and if each caucus is just doing their own individual thing and the SU isn’t on the same page, then the SU as a whole isn’t able to coalesce, discuss, and prioritize.”</p><p>In regards to moving onto the next chapter, Saha and Rohrig want to continue their efforts in making opportunities available to the student body. They plan to establish a task force to aid Internship Coordinator Harvey Blumm to build upon the Student Bulletin and create an online database of Stuyvesant alumni for students to reach out to. “As seniors, we need to start focusing on what we need to do with our futures,” Saha said. “We can have a career day, where students can learn more about the opportunities they have and their futures.”</p><p>Despite having an organized vision for the Senior Caucus, Saha and Rohrig intend to continue a well-established method of communication through e-mail and Facebook, gauging the interests and needs of the senior class. To further strengthen school spirit, they propose beginning a PSAL awards ceremony.</p><p>Having already worked with Princeton Review to subsidize the cost of JProm, Saha and Rohrig plan to use this growing relationship to help make senior activities more affordable. “We also talked to [Princeton Review] about building more of a relationship going forward, where they are going to post practice tests for Stuyvesant students in exchange for funding,” Rohrig said. “By subsidizing costs, [we hope] everyone is able to attend these events that make up the huge memories of senior year.”</p><p>They are also exploring the possibility of an alternative venue for graduation. “We want to see if we can get a better venue,” Saha said. “We want to look at Madison Square Garden or Lincoln Center. [Though,] the budget has been a problem.”</p><p>Overall, Saha and Rohrig are confident in their abilities to carry out these plans. “The reason why we had such a successful junior year was because of how efficient our partnership is,” Saha said. “We don’t see each other with the distinction of President or Vice President. We go at it as Co-Presidents.”</p><p><h4>Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino — Student Union</h4></p><p>“Every SU in the past and every platform that you’ve seen in the past always has specific ideas, and we lack that, and that’s good,” Chowdhury said. The SU President-elect and his running mate are taking a radically new approach, opting for a broad vision rather than a detailed agenda. They presented a 29 page platform — not outlining new policies, but explaining how they will structure the SU to be “bigger, bolder, and better.”</p><p>“Our goal is to create an SU that is able to do everything, all the time. Anything people ask for, we’re going to deliver,” Chowdhury said. They paused to qualify. “[If it’s] Reasonable. That’s important,” Valentino said.</p><p>As Vice President, Chowdhury has already expanded the SU by a factor of ten to include over 200 members, and Valentino has worked rigorously to ensure they have a tightly-run operation. “What we want to do is create a stable SU and a stable organization. Students don’t have power because there isn’t stability,” Chowdhury said. They believe this larger, more efficient SU has already proven itself, citing success in establishing a printing station and bathroom hooks.</p><p>In the coming year, they aim to consolidate the different caucuses into a unified front, which will be able to tackle grandiose projects and make bold demands. “What ends up happening is the administration views the students as one whole group, so if a caucus gets something then another caucus might not. At the end of the day we’re really just one union, so we’re going to look at the caucus platforms and we’re going to create a [single] year-long agenda that we’re going to execute,” Chowdhury said.</p><p>They do have a few specific ideas for putting their expanded power to use, including a second Club Pub Fair and locker trading system, the latter of which is nearing completion. Most ambitious is opening up the fifth floor balcony. With improved organization and a designated task force, they believe this could soon become feasible. “We’re better able to get a grasp [on SU organization] so now we are able to designate someone specifically in charge of working on the fifth floor balcony project,” Valentino said.</p><p>Their victory is impressive for two reasons. Obviously, they ran unopposed. But perhaps more importantly, Valentino is the first female SU Vice President in years, following a “dynasty” consisting of five consecutive male presidents and vice presidents.</p><p>“I’m really proud to say I’m one of the first female representatives of the SU in a really long time. It’s kind of cheesy, [but] other females should be inspired to be in the government and I just hope that I do a good job,” Valentino said.</p><p>As for running unopposed, Chowdhury takes it as a vote of confidence. “I think people genuinely believe we did a decent job this year compared to previous years and compared to what other people could do, and they’re giving us the opportunity to complete what we started, and that’s what the platform is, completing what we started,” he said.</p>	Article	380	2017-12-28 20:44:27.418683	2017-12-28 20:44:27.418683
1015	﻿Pool Freezes Over and Traps Several Freshmen After a series of unfortunate events, the pool froze over, inciting mixed reactions from teachers and students. <p>The pool froze over following a stressful week of blizzards and several mishaps with a recent chemistry lab involving liquid nitrogen, trapping several freshmen in swim gym.</p><p>Teachers have responded with outrage, demanding that an emergency rescue squad be sent in to recover the frozen bodies. One anonymous teacher was even willing to violate department rules and offer the frozen freshmen make-up tests once rescued. Though the rescue team was armed with ice picks, chainsaws, and an industrial-grade jackhammer, the rescuers’ efforts only managed to create an inch-deep crack in the pool.</p><p>After seeing their failed attempts, the biology faculty members decided to take matters into their own hands by pouring out their scalding hot mugs of coffee onto the ice. With the combined forces of the rescue squad and about 16 propane tanks’ worth of coffee, a single pair of moldy swim trunks jammed in the water filter was successfully freed from the ice.</p><p>The subsequent shortage of coffee put the teachers in a terrible mood for the rest of the day; extensive examinations on the effects of caffeine withdrawal on the human body were given.</p><p>Sophomore Steve Wang took this opportunity to improve his floor hockey skills for gym class. “This ice is perfect for practice,” Wang declared. “It’s exactly the same hardness as the gym floor, so I get to go through the same experience of falling on my face as I do in gym, except with even more numbing pain from the cold!”</p><p>While the pool remains frozen at the time of this article’s publication, another rescue attempt is projected to take place in early February. Now armed with the school’s supply of Bunsen burners, the team expects their next rescue to be a successful one. Until then, the freshmen are expected to survive off dank memes viewed through a giant projector above the pool.</p>	Article	413	2018-01-23 02:57:42.267897	2018-01-23 02:57:42.267897
1017	﻿Rebels Are Down To The Wire Again  <p>With two seconds remaining in a suspenseful game against Washington Irving High School and the deficit of just three points, all eyes were on senior Nicholas Kim. Kim had the hot hand from behind the arc, having scored 12 of his 18 points from three-point range, and a three was what the Runnin’ Rebels, Stuyvesant’s boys’ basketball team, needed. Tension in the gym started to build as the Rebels broke their huddle, where coach and guidance counselor Paul Goldsman had drawn up an inbound play in an attempt to get a good look at the basket and send the game into overtime. The scheme worked: as senior Sean Chung looked frantically for the first open teammate he could find, he sent a pass to Kim, as their coach had designed. Despite his wide open opportunity, Kim could not continue his success from beyond the arc; he bobbled Chung’s pass and was unable to get a good shot off, ending the Rebels’ hopes for a thrilling victory. The team was handed its second straight loss by a final score of 46-41 and dropped to 1-7 on the season.</p><p>The game was close out of the gate. Even as the Rebels’ season-long turnover struggles continued, Irving was missing its shots and senior Nicola Manfredi kept them in the game, scoring all seven of his points in the first quarter. “We didn’t move the ball well enough against Irving. However, I think we showed heart by staying in the game when they were physically larger than us,” Manfredi said. This was reflected as the turnovers spilled into the second quarter for the Rebels and they fell into an eight-point hole, but a strong finish spearheaded by Kim—who had begun to heat up from long range—cut the deficit to just four to end the quarter.</p><p>In the third quarter, some strong half-court defense thanks to a shift in strategy by Goldsman helped cut the opponents’ lead to two for some time and keep the Rebels in the game. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to capitalize, as they struggled to convert on the turnovers their strong defense created. Inevitably, turnovers came back to bite them again in conjunction with poor transition defense as the opposition took advantage of plentiful fast breaks. By the end of the quarter, Irving’s lead was at just six points thanks to some weak free throw shooting on its part.</p><p>The fourth quarter is where things really started to get interesting. Initially, Irving looked as if it was going to run away with the game as the team extended their lead to double digits. However, with time dwindling, a Rebel run spurred by strong three-point shooting from Kim sliced the lead down to three. Despite the shift in momentum, the Rebels were not able to close out the game.</p><p>The team finished the eventful month of December with a 1-5 record. The Rebels enjoyed a convincing 18-point away victory against the Norman Thomas Tigers on December 19. Conversely, the team suffered a demoralizing away loss at the hands of a strong Seward Park Campus Bears team.</p><p>Statistically, they have been too concentrated thus far this season. In terms of scoring, Manfredi and Kim led the way with 9.6 and 9.5 points per game, respectively, both placing within the top 15 scorers in the division. Aside from senior Michael Gillow, no other Rebel is averaging more than 4.5 points per game. Similarly, Gillow’s 2.9 assists per game led the team and placed him at 12th in the division, but no other Rebel makes an appearance on the leaderboard like senior Sean Chung, junior Ricky Zou, and Manfredi do in the 20-30 range, averaging just 1.3, 1.1 and one assist, respectively.</p><p>The Rebels have struggled with ball movement, and as they work on it, they are likely to see increases in the assist numbers and distribution of scoring. While the rebounding numbers are better distributed among four players with rebounding totals between 20 and 30, the Rebels are not well represented on the division leaderboard in that statistic. The Rebels hope to play more consistently in the five games they have remaining in the month of January.</p><p>As playoff berth begins to slip out of reach, the team is working to improve each game. “Our goal is still to make playoffs even though it’s a much harder task at this point,” Manfredi said. The Rebels have shown that they can compete with enough of their opposition to make a run for the playoffs. Often, the deficits in their 9-12 point losses were created almost entirely in one quarter while the Rebels played at par or better than the opposition during the rest of the game. If they improve on their ball movement and protection, they can close out games and finish the season strong despite the hole that they’ve dug themselves into. Goldsman is similarly optimistic. “I have seen significant improvements in some of our players and I hope it ultimately leads Stuyvesant to garnering some more victories,” he said. “We have played in many close games, and I believe that if we protect the ball better and make our free throws, those three-point loses can easily became five-point victories.”</p>	Article	415	2018-01-23 02:58:04.540793	2018-01-23 02:58:04.540793
1018	﻿The NFL Schedule: A Giant Rubik’s Cube The process behind creating the NFL schedule is very complicated and requires a lot of math, science, and human input. <p>Imagine a Rubik’s cube. When it’s mixed up, it’s difficult to solve for the average person. Now, imagine that certain squares are locked in place, but other squares are meant to coincide with different parts of the cube. The NFL schedule is exactly this: a giant Rubik’s cube with fixed pieces. Two of the people responsible for creating this schedule are Howard Katz, NFL Senior Vice President of Broadcasting and Media, and Michael North, Senior Director of Broadcasting. I recently sat down and spoke with them about how they make the NFL schedule, a technology and math problem that might stump even the best Stuy student.</p><p>Katz and North begin their work on the schedule in January, while the previous NFL season is still going on. It’s a long and arduous process. “There are over 700 trillion possible schedules out there. We’re looking for a needle in a haystack, but the first thing to do is to see if we can find the right haystack,” Katz said.</p><p>He and North use a program which relies on a network of more than 200 computers worldwide. This program has tens of billions of variables, including nearly every possible change that could be made to a schedule. “It’s a combination of math, science, and human input,” Katz said.</p><p>“[We] know the 256 matchups the day the [previous] regular season ends,” North said. For each team, this includes six games against the three other teams in their division (one home and one away), four games against teams from a division in the American Football Conference (AFC), four games against teams from a division in the National Football Conference (NFC), and two games against teams in their conference, which are chosen based on the previous year’s regular season record.</p><p>The NFL uses a set of 30,000 rules, each with a certain number of points attached to them, to determine the usability of their schedule. These rules have points assigned to them, from 1 point (barely consequential) to 999 points (absolutely cannot be broken).</p><p>One major issue with matchups is that they have to fit within a team’s stadium blocks, the days when it is available. “The first thing we do is take all the stadium blocks and put those onto the board to show when you can’t play a game at a stadium,” Katz said. These blocks can range from baseball games (in places like Oakland and Philadelphia), the Chicago Marathon, or even NASCAR.</p><p>Another issue is balancing the schedule between being team-friendly and TV-friendly. “Somewhere between these two extremes, we’re looking for the right shade of gray instead of black or white,” North said. “It’s not even about satisfying [the teams and the networks], it’s about disappointing them, hopefully equally and hopefully not that much.” That is, finding the best possible balance between giving the teams enough rest and making sure the best games get on TV.  “Our job is to make sure that those must-see matchups get into must-see windows,” North said. These must-see windows are the primetime games and the 4:15 - 4:30 start-time games on Sunday. The teams that get into these windows the most are usually the Cowboys, Packers, Patriots, and Steelers, as they have the largest national followings.</p><p>To do so, the NFL employs two methods: flex games and cross-flexing. Flex games are games late in the season that can have their time changed a week in advance, and cross-flexing is switching games between Fox and CBS to ensure that more of the country sees a big game. This usually occurs when a team that was not expected to be good at the beginning of the season becomes a team of national relevance. A recent example was the Los Angeles (LA) Rams. “No one saw the LA Rams coming,” Katz said. This is what led to the week 12 cross-flex of the Saints-Rams game from 1:00 PM ET on Fox to 4:15 PM ET on CBS.</p><p>Not surprisingly, technology has been a game changer in how the NFL is scheduled nowadays. “We’re more sophisticated than we’ve ever been before and our clubs are too,” Katz said. “We’re looking at things we would have never thought about because technology allows us to do that now.” But, even with today’s technology, complex math and human touch are still necessary to solve the Rubik’s Cube made up of tens of billions of variables, 256 matchups, 30,000 rules, and over 700 trillion possible solutions that make up the NFL’s regular season schedule.</p>	Article	416	2018-01-23 02:58:52.913926	2018-01-23 02:58:52.913926
1021	﻿Titans Lose First Game in Four Years Though the Stuyvesant Boys’ Table Tennis team, the Titans, was dealt their first loss in 5 years, ending their 60+ game win streak, they still hope to win their fifth consecutive title in Coach Feigenbaum’s last year. <p>After some extremely competitive back-and-forth rallies, first singles and senior Alvin Chen was winning 2-1. It was match point, during which Chen could win the whole match and give his team the much sought-after win. While the ball was in midair, he took a step back and wound up his arm and swung his hardest, hitting the ball with extreme speed. However, his opponent from Brooklyn Technical High School, Gabriel Riskevich hit the ball twice as fast. Riskevich came back to win the game and the next one, winning the entire match, 3 games to Chen’s 2.</p><p>The Stuyvesant Titans, the boys’ table tennis team, has lost one game in the last five years to Brooklyn Technical Engineers, their all-time rivals. Before their last game on January 9, they had an ongoing win streak that spanned over 60 games, which is the majority of coach Bernard Feigenbaum’s entire career with the team.</p><p>At the end of their regular season, the Titans placed first in the Central Division, consisting of teams in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, with a record of 11-1. They shut out every team other than the Engineers (5-0) effortlessly.</p><p>The team has won all its scheduled matches this season. Senior and captain Isaac Rose Berman and his doubles partner, senior Nicholas Pustilnik, have won all of their matches this season, along with second singles junior Mark Amstislavskiy. Because Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Technical High School are so evenly matched, it just takes a few points to change the direction of the score. “We need either first singles or second doubles to win [against Brooklyn Tech]. Alvin came close [to Riskevich] in first singles, [and] it gave me confidence [that] Alvin could win [his game] in cities,” coach Feigenbaum said.</p><p>The Titans will likely face Brooklyn Tech again in the final round of the playoffs, as they are the two best teams in the PSAL. The Titans have overcome a lot to reach where they are today: they started a new season without the core three, Alston Wang (‘17), William Yao (‘17) and Eric Amstislavskiy (‘17), a group of seniors who led the team to four consecutive trophies. They’ve hit a rough bump with their most recent regular season game, but still have high hopes for a fifth consecutive championship. One regular season loss does not make or break a season.</p>	Article	419	2018-01-23 03:00:07.351599	2018-01-23 03:00:07.351599
1022	﻿Felines Pounce on Successful Season  <p>“I’m really proud of what we’ve gotten to and achieved so far in the year, and I’m looking forward to a successful and progressive rest of the the season.” —Lee-Ann Rushlow, junior and co-captain</p><p>The Felines, Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity gymnastics team, are maintaining a strong season, despite the loss of valuable players who graduated last year. They currently hold a fourth place standing in the Bronx/Manhattan division, one that they held last year as well, missing third place by less than a point. The team has won all but one meet to the Bronx High School of Science, the team’s longtime rival, with a final score of 99.3-102.6. The Felines also lost to Bronx Science at their divisional meet with a total score of 103.3, putting them in second place behind Bronx Science’s score of 115.97.</p><p>Despite losing several key seniors who graduated last year, the team has remained on its feet. In their first meet of the season, the lineup was composed predominantly of returning junior and senior athletes, other than freshman Naomi Khanna. “Because the first meet was only about a month and week after the season started, it would be asking too much for any newer girls or less experienced girls to be ready for a competition,” Coach Vasken Choubaralian said.</p><p>As the season continued, however, newer gymnasts have been participating in events as well. “We're really lucky to have experienced freshmen Naomi Khanna and Anya Zorin and junior Leah Rosenthal join the team to make up for the three [graduated] seniors,” senior and co-captain Annie Lee said. “Coach Choubaralian always wants to give less experienced girls a chance to compete.”</p><p>With Khanna as a strong all-around player and Rosenthal and Zorin obtaining between sevens in the balance beam and vaulting events respectively, the team is using its new members to its advantage and helping to prepare them for next year when some of the strongest players, like senior Anna Pacheco and Lee, graduate.</p><p>The team is practicing on fixing more minor errors, where they tend to lose a lot of points. “We're working on really perfecting all our routines because in gymnastics, we get deducted for the smallest details like flexed feet and bent legs,” Lee said. While almost all of the Felines have been participating in multiple events at different meets this season, nearing the end, the team is going to be relying on the returning members.</p><p>“As we near the finals, my veterans and my experienced gymnasts will be competing, especially in the finals,” Coach Choubaralian said.</p><p>The team hopes to maintain its current fourth place position in the city. While replacing the Bronx High School of Science in third place has always been the team’s goal, it will require a major comeback after the initial loss of more than 12 points to Science. However, they haven’t lost hope and still have several remaining meets. “I’m really proud of what we’ve gotten to and achieved so far in the year, and I’m looking forward to a successful and progressive rest of the the season,” junior and co-captain Lee-Ann Rushlow said. With Science having had success in their season thus far, the Felines have their work cut out for them if they hope to catch any teams in front of them in the division.</p>	Article	420	2018-01-23 03:00:58.895925	2018-01-23 03:00:58.895925
1028	﻿Senior SING!: Fairy Tales are Women’s Tales  <p>Fairy tales are women’s tales: Sleeping Beauty rescued by the gallant Prince Charming, Snow White’s maternal impulse toward the dwarves, and Cinderella forced to scrub the floors. These stories used to put us to bed at night, teaching young girls that they should strive to become objects of male attention and teaching young boys that every girl is an unambitious damsel in distress.</p><p>With Princess Esme’s (Lizzy Lawrence) strong-willed temperament and Prince Chauncey’s (Michael Holmes) ineptitude, Senior SING!, coordinated by Winston Venderbush with the help of producers Vicky Wu, Maddie Ostergaard, Namra Zulfiqar, and Dina Gomaa, was medieval with a twist, weaving an entirely new women’s tale.</p><p>The audience is immediately made aware of Esme’s predicament: her first queue to speak is cut off by King Bartholomew (Dennis Ronel), her father, whose focus is entirely on Chauncey’s coronation. Continuously silenced and overshadowed, Esme is disgruntled with Chauncey’s nonchalance toward the throne, yet she remains anything but demure or helpless.</p><p>It may not have been a girl sitting in a tower, singing to the birds, but Senior SING! opened up with visions of our childhood. Within a castle on a hill, stained glass reflected light onto golden thrones. With a stunning background and eagle statues, senior art, directed by Yuji Fu, Lauren Moy, Jasmine  Zhang, and Miranda Luong, and senior props, directed by Sydney Dlhopolsky, made us feel like we were in the Kingdom of Wessex.</p><p>The coronation festivities began with a hymn-like rendition of “Some Nights,” as chorus, step, and cast gathered on stage, the sheer number of performers inspiring awe.</p><p>Amidst this flurry of celebration, senior latin, directed by Levy Agaronnik and Joshua Lishnevetsky, sensually materialized before the crowd, hips thrusting and bodies swaying. Their liveliness was pronounced and every movement emboldened with character, making them our favorite crew of the night.</p><p>Following King Bartholomew’s resounding “no” to Esme’s attempt to speak, Yorick the jack-in-the-box (Alec Dai) is brought forth as comedic relief. Taking a drink from Chauncey’s goblet, he collapses back into the box—poisoned.</p><p>“Clear the Senior Atrium!” is shouted across the stage, a reference to antagonisms between the senior class and administration, connecting the otherwise distant theme to Stuyvesant students. From the ensuing stampede emerges senior step, the castle guards, directed by Jason Chen, Samuel So, and Kelly Wang. Between their reverence for senior pride and the reverberations created by each stomp, their unity was on full display. Holding their S-E-N-I-O-R shields high, they ended with a blindingly fast sequence.</p><p>Once again, Esme’s tensions rise to the surface when King Bartholomew focuses his attention entirely on Chauncey. Reminding us of her misplaced anger, Esme remarked condescendingly, “Who would want to kill Chauncey?” This continuous use of foreshadowing gives the script a complexity not seen in years past, creating anticipation amongst the audience for a breaking point in their relationship.</p><p>In an attempt to protect Chauncey, the king calls on the services of Sir Komsyze (Evan Lieberman), a Monty Python-esque knight and sorceress Helloise (Emily Ma), Chauncey’s budding love interest. Far from being stoic bodyguards, this pair lead the siblings on an adventure to find a safe haven, but instead they come across a plague-infested village.</p><p>In the face of this suffering, Esme emphasized that a leader must shoulder the burden of his or her people. Meanwhile, Chauncey cowered at the people’s pain, shattering the traditional association between masculinity and strength or conviction.</p><p>The atmosphere darkened, the air became murky, and the black plague encircled Chauncey. Senior modern, directed by Nadia Filanovsky and Enver Ramadani, began their performance with a haunting execution of “Ring Around the Rosie.” Wilting flower petals fell to the floor as the dancers sought to embody the plague with each eery, coordinated step.</p><p>Donning black silk and green velvet, the powerful figure of Helloise stepped in to save Chauncey, who was overwhelmed by the reality of his subjects’ living conditions. Even supporting female roles, traditionally lacking depth, were able to manifest themselves into positive role models.</p><p>The next obstacle the travellers overcame was a snake pit: senior belly, directed by Shupti Biswas and Sabrina Pirzada. A mix of jazz and blues highlighted their sensuous, undulating torsos, only a small sample of the senior band’s talent, directed by Jean Joun and Sam Lazarev. Somewhat incongruous with last year’s performance, belly lacked male participation.</p><p>When a third obstacle appears, the path to safety threatens to become repetitive and tedious, but senior hip hop, directed by Jian Ting, Muhammad Rivaldo, Nina Uzoigwe, and Tony Zheng, managed to further engage the audience. Dressed as bandits in black, holding knives, and dancing fluidly, performers popped up in the aisles to create an electrifying moment.</p><p>Almost randomly, a dragon then appears in their path. With its four members, senior flow, directed by Wilson Wong and Ayman Ahmed, seemed to lack purpose. Last year, senior flow set the precedent of being much more than floating lights; this year, flow failed to innovate, and unlike the other crews, seemed to be carelessly thrown into the story.</p><p>Completely in character, Chauncey fails to protect himself, and his carelessness pushes Esme to her breaking point; she proclaims it would have been better if he had died.</p><p>Back at the castle, the Royal Family has troubles of its own. After interrogating several quirky characters, Esme becomes their prime suspect when her best friend Priscilla Marie (Lillian Carver) testifies against her. Marie is represented as a gossiping gold digger, and was executed brilliantly. Her nasally voice and frantic body motions lent themselves perfectly to the stereotype.</p><p>Making her first appearance as a developed character, Queen Christiana (Kate Johnston), shocked by this information, performs a heartbreaking medley of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” with the overlapping voice of Esme singing “Back to Black” as she confronts her hateful words toward her brother. Though Junior SING! attempted a similar feat, they were unable to achieve this level of cohesion.</p><p>Finally, our protagonists reached two forks in the road, and we appreciated the pun. Here, Sir Komsyze and Helloise each took different routes, leaving Esme and Chauncey to confront their culminating tensions.</p><p>Esme vented her frustrations: while Chauncey spent his childhood learning to joust, she was taught to dress pretty. The intent of her speech was to have the audience acknowledge how gender roles can be discouraging forces, transforming SING! from a celebration of creativity to a platform for student voices.</p><p>Through a duet of “Halo,” Chauncey and Esme are able to reconcile. As the lights and sound crew, directed by Jonathan Mikhaylov and Lela Ni, placed a simple spotlight on Chauncey and Esme, the audience showed their support with flashlights. Chauncey’s timbre was warm and rich and complemented Esme’s sweeter tones.</p><p>This tender moment is interrupted by a surprising plot twist. Overlooked for the majority of the play, Sir Komsyze stabs Chauncey and reveals that he has successfully framed Esme for this murder. Esme takes a stand by picking up Chauncey’s blade and fighting the trained knight, showing her courage and compassion.</p><p>All night Senior SING! had tip-toed around the fourth wall, and they finally breached it: Lawrence and Lieberman break character and call for stunt doubles. A dramatic fight scene ensues, and Esme emerges victorious. However, her success is short-lived; she is captured and taken to the castle for her execution.</p><p>Confronted with seemingly concrete evidence that his daughter killed his son, King Bartholomew grieves for both of his children through his moving performance of “Hallelujah.” When Esme attempts to explain the situation, she once again is silenced.</p><p>In the final minutes before her execution, Chauncey and Heloise miraculously arrive at the scene and reveal Sir Komsyze’s treachery. Chauncey comes to the realization that Esme understands and cares about the well-being of the kingdom more than he does. He forfeits his crown to Esme, showing the importance of humility and reversing the stereotype of men being best suited for leadership positions; her coronation is a feminist triumph.</p><p>The coronation festivities were born anew, and senior swing, directed by Levy Agaronnik and Joshua Lishnevetsky, excelled just as much as senior latin. Senior SING! seemed to make deliberate decisions that shaped their show, not only as a progressive, but also as a well-crafted story. In an almost cyclical manner, Esme and Chauncey’s long journey begins and ends with the passing of the crown.</p><p>Likewise, Senior SING! was able to incorporate pop culture references that modernized what would have been an archaic fairy tale. Though he was a recurring comedic relief, High Priest (Lowell Weisbord), with his rapping, dancing, and pop culture references, proved to be one of the highlights of the show.</p><p>By the end of the show, Senior SING! solidified the idea that fairy tales are women’s tales. These are the stories our children will grow up hearing: Michelle Obama, Angela Merkel, Sonia Sotamayor, and Queen Esme.</p>	Article	426	2018-01-23 22:26:42.1475	2018-01-23 22:26:42.1475
996	﻿What’s on Your Nose?  <p>Often written in between the lines of the grade breakdown on the syllabus is the liberty some teachers reserve to include intangibles, such as participation, engagement, or, in some cases, good old-fashioned brown-nosing. Opinions writers went out to determine the nature of kissing up at Stuyvesant, to find out how teachers respond to it (spoiler alert: a number refused or were reluctant to discuss it at all), and to consider their own stances.</p><p><h4>Mia Gindis, sophomore</h4></p><p>I’ve always made the effort to give my teachers gifts over the holidays. There was never any ulterior motive—I simply wanted to show my gratitude for their ability to deal with me for an entire semester.</p><p>Regardless, the distinction between genuine kindness and a kid who's just looking for a curve next marking period shouldn’t need to be made, because either way, a present shouldn’t affect anything. There have even been instances of teachers returning to students gifts they deemed too expensive. Teachers should always accept the gift; it just shouldn't change their minds grading-wise. Handing a gift back almost exclusively shows that it would.</p><p><h4>Jessy Mei, sophomore</h4></p><p>Is it really moral to justify and normalize this culture of being untrue to one’s abilities and personality to gain favor with a teacher? Though the intent may be shallow, hopes of achieving academic success can push students out of their comfort zones to participate or seek help in subjects they struggle in, developing their knowledge and understanding of the topic, pushing them to learn and strive for success. However, when those hopes become too ambitious and students wander out of the academic field into the field of achieving personal bias from teachers, hardworking students become punished for their honesty and academic effort. In the case where a strong work ethic and integrity [don’t] suffice to succeed or do well in class, the line becomes blurred, but in most cases, there are always alternative steps to better one’s grade. Ultimately, it is up to us how we proceed in our four years at Stuyvesant, but when it comes to gifts, it is always best to keep it simple and handwritten, because even the most expensive gifts won’t carry our grade, but the things we will remember once we graduate are the teachers who gave us the opportunity to learn and thrive.</p><p><h4>Jonela Malollari, junior</h4></p><p>Kissing up to teachers as a substitute for working for your grade is desperate at best and pitiful at worst. Stuyvesant may not be perfect, but the whole point of the grading system is that your grades are supposed to reflect the amount of effort you put into a class and your progress in your understanding of the material. It’s not supposed to illustrate how well you can win someone's favor. I get that there's often a very real sense of desperation behind a poor grade that makes students resort to things, however minor or inconsequential, that they would usually consider beneath them. But for success to mean anything, you have to take what you get whether you earned it positively or negatively. A number isn't worth your integrity. As for teachers who blatantly buy into and encourage favoritism in their classroom, why would you lower yourself to their level?</p><p>Some students claim that sucking up is necessary to improve their college applications, but this argument is flimsy. Whether the points a student scores from brown-nosing are negligible or significant, if you’re doing well in most of your classes, you don’t need to depend on manipulative tactics, and good grades are usually indicative of a strong work ethic regardless. If you’re generally an excellent student but happen to end up with an unfair teacher, the grade that teacher gives you will stand out as an obvious outlier. Students who rely on ingratiation as a crutch are more likely to have a poor work ethic anyway, and if you’re doing poorly in most of your classes, brown-nosing isn’t going to remedy that. Even if it did, so what? Maybe this is overly idealistic, but high school and college are temporary; the type of person you are and the decisions you make are infinitely more important.</p><p><h4>Emily Hur, junior</h4></p><p>In the end, all Stuyvesant students are striving for the same goal: good grades. While some may fulfill this dream, others will fall short. Abandoning integrity in favor of pursuing a higher grade may be inherently wrong, but ultimately, it’s a tradition that may follow many of us into the workplace. We resort to kissing up as a grade-boosting tactic and use hasty excuses to justify it, and we convince ourselves it’s the competitive atmosphere and even deceive ourselves by maintaining that we’re “just being nice.” But in the end, brown-nosing can facilitate a harsher, more cutthroat environment at school.</p><p>While this practice certainly shouldn’t be condoned, it shouldn’t be persecuted, and [it] is up to the volition of individual students. Ultimately, teachers and the administration should use their own discretion and not allow gifts to cloud their judgments, while students should also prioritize merit and honesty over trying to gain an edge over others.</p><p><h4>Anne Rhee, freshman</h4></p><p>I feel that it is very important to recognize the different levels of attention or appreciation given to a teacher in order to really define what “kissing up” is. On one side, I do believe that flattery, or even constant appreciation shown to a teacher, is often wrong, since it is a waste of time to flatter a teacher rather than work hard and get good grades. From my personal experience, I have seen many students try hard to get their teachers’ attentions, but every student has different ways of expressing this. It is not only about the way this attention is shown, but also why the students “kiss up.” Because of the constant reason of “college applications” or a “recommendation” to justify why they try to experience a better relationship with their teacher, I feel that you must create this relationship in other ways. Students and teachers should get along because they have common interests or [because] they become friends, rather than [by] buying their attentions with presents or generic compliments. Not only is the foundation for this type of friendship stronger, but [it is] also guaranteed to be genuine and last longer.</p><p><h4>Angela Wong, freshman</h4></p><p>Why does going the extra mile in school, such as by participating in class, complimenting teachers, or giving gifts around the holidays, have such a negative connotation? When the mindset behind flattery is to receive a curved grade, the line is drawn between putting in enthusiasm and being fake. When one’s intentions are self-interested, such flattery loses its true meaning and instead becomes “kissing up.” The easiest way to distinguish between deceitful and genuine intentions is by asking, “If I knew my grade would not be altered by my flattering actions, would I still do them?”</p><p><h4>Bryan Monge Serrano, sophomore</h4></p><p>These occurrences show that brown-nosing is a big pandemic in our school community, but I believe that this issue should be and has been handled by teachers responsibly. Teachers should be responsible and reasonable with gifts [and] not [let] them interfere with their grading. If the teacher is unfair and irresponsible with gift giving, this encourages an environment where some students are punished simply for not having money.</p><p>Teachers are the people who mainly affect the brown-nosing culture since they are the ones receiving the gifts. They must be fair to all students by making clear guidelines of what gifts they will accept and having students blindly give them gifts, so they still know who gave them gifts, but not which gift so as to minimize a change in their grading. Teachers must also be responsible and accept gifts with open arms after they have submitted their finals grades since this also promotes a fair environment where students do not feel cheated, since everyone was graded with the same criteria and with minimal outside factors affecting their grade.</p><p><h4>Anta Noor, junior</h4></p><p>Ever since elementary school, I have given small gifts to teachers during the holiday season as a token of my appreciation. I know many of my friends do the same to show gratitude toward the teacher. I personally think that gift giving is not “kissing up” to a teacher, and it’s more of a friendly notion towards the teacher than an academic one.</p><p>However, I believe “kissing up” or brown-nosing does exist and is acceptable when it comes to unfair teachers. Some of my friends and I have had teachers who show clear favoritism to some students over others, and give grades based on how much they like the student. I think it’s okay to “kiss up” to a teacher if the student knows it will give them a higher grade, because that’s just how the teacher is. It might not seem right, but in the overall outlook, “kissing up” happens in our daily lives a lot because we can gain from it. All in all, I believe “kissing up” is acceptable when it’s directly correlated to the grade the teacher will give you, and if it isn’t, then there’s no need for it.</p><p><h4>Adam Oubaita, junior</h4></p><p>A highly competitive atmosphere such as Stuyvesant is a breeding ground for kissing up. People are always concerned with their grades and always want to improve them, so certain people resort to brown- nosing. While I personally believe in actually doing work instead of hoping for a curve, I can’t blame students for trying to heighten their grade through artificial means.</p><p>However, it is important to note that not everyone has a devious scheme to brown-nose their teachers. There is a sharp distinction between kissing up and being friendly with teachers. When the holiday seasons come along, I write letters to my teachers and impactful people in Stuy expressing my gratitude for the education they provide, the help they offer, and the time they spend. And when writing these letters, I am not expecting my average to rise all of a sudden. Plenty of friends have also given gifts to teachers as a sign of gratitude.</p><p><h4>Maia Brydon, junior</h4></p><p>I haven't really given presents to my teachers since elementary school, and this Christmas was nerve-wracking because it seemed like everyone else was. But in all honesty, I think a lot of the gift-giving and "forced interest" students do is not really done with an ulterior motive (or at least not a conscious one). I admit that a lot of the people who constantly go to talk to teachers after class do seem really obnoxious, but being Stuyvesant students, I think a lot of us actually do that out of genuine interest in what we're asking about. As for gift-giving, I know that at least some people do that out of honest appreciation and courtesy, nothing else. I believe a lot of people subconsciously give gifts in part because they believe it will gain them favor, but I think that's definitely not the only reason for it.</p><p>Even if I understand the motive to kiss up to more unfair teachers, there are never teachers who are unfair to the extent that students are forced to sacrifice their integrity for a grade. But there are certainly teachers who play favorites more than others, which is where it seems students get caught up in brown- nosing. To most Stuyvesant students, I would say, getting a higher grade certainly matters more than your integrity. Especially if it’s just little things, like saying goodbye to a teacher every day, it doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, even if you are giving up your integrity to a certain extent. This mindset extends a lot further than just high school, too—kids suck up to their parents to get what they want, and people in many industries suck up to their bosses to look better. It's just how a lot of people tend to react when they want something—they try to gain favor through little things, little things that they don’t consider all that morally wrong.</p><p><h4>Eric Ferencz, English </h4></p><p>In my opinion, "kissing up" is when a student uses compliments or kindness to manipulate a teacher into giving him/her favorable treatment, particularly if the student is attempting to compensate for some sort of academic shortcoming. I imagine that buckling down and working hard takes much more effort than flattery or affectation.</p><p>Me? I'm much more interested in my students' professional characteristics. Come to class on time. Try to participate once a day. Share with your peers. Hand in your work on time, and if you're going to be late, ask for an extension four days in advance.</p><p><h4>Eric Grossman, Assistant Principal of English</h4></p><p>My sense is that most of the teachers I know are fully capable of appreciating a thoughtful gift, but not letting it have anything to do with their grading practice. In the end, the intent behind giving a gift doesn’t really matter, because it doesn’t have anything to do with it. I tend to always think the best of my students—and not just concerning presents. Ultimately, a grade in class is about the work and the effort that you’ve put into it, and I have students that I’ve thought the world of who’ve done terribly in my classes, because as much as I liked them, they didn’t hand in work. But those are separate things.</p><p><h4>Robert Sandler, U.S. History</h4></p><p>If a kid says hello to me in the hallway, do I think they’re sucking up? I’d say they’re just saying hi. They want me to know who they are, which makes sense; I would do the same thing if I was in their shoes. I think giving somebody a card and saying something nice if they appreciate your passion for teaching or they give you something small like a little token—I don’t see it as a big deal. I think of it as the kids are just trying to express their gratitude. I give my own children’s teachers little tokens—small, inexpensive gifts—and write them cards.</p><p>I’ve never once said to my peer or colleague, “Look at this kid, trying to get a good grade by doing this.” Because it won’t work with me anyway, it’s all based on how they participate, their test scores, so I don’t think about it that much because it never really factors in. If I have a kid after class stay and ask questions, they seem like they’re genuinely interested. Like, is there some part of them that thinks they’re calculating, oh, so this might help them increase their grade? Yeah, that might be part of the calculus, but like, that’s fine, I think that all of our behaviors have multiple motivations behind them.</p><p><h4>Lauren Stuzin, English</h4></p><p>I don’t think I’ve noticed that it’s a problem. I think, first of all, that there’s a distinction to be made between wanting to be professional in class and wanting to make a good impression and being respectful to a teacher versus trying to mask some negative part of your performance in class. Some students may be nice to teachers to compensate for something […] I think students and teachers alike know that this is a thing that could happen in schools, it could happen anywhere, but I haven’t noticed it being an issue.</p><p><h4>Julie Sheinman, English</h4></p><p>The problem with students who are trying to use gifts to get an advantage in terms of grading in the form of a curve for the following marking period, for example, is much greater during the first semester around the holiday season, rather than at the end of the year. This is due to most grades being submitted and done with towards the beginning of June at the end of the year, so the chances of a gift affecting a grade is minimal.</p><p>I think that most students are being kind and genuine when giving presents and I believe teachers should accept the presents as a sign of care and gratitude, but only if they know it will not affect their grading. I myself had to reject a gift card a student gave me since I knew it was something that had a lot of value and could possibly affect my grading.</p><p><h4>Emilio Nieves, English</h4></p><p>If “kissing up to teachers” happens at Stuyvesant, it does so on such a small scale that it's not even worth writing a story about. I think it is a hasty generalization (a logical fallacy!) to assert that "Stuyvesant students, in general, are very good at kissing up to teachers."</p><p>This statement contradicts my experiences at Stuyvesant (17 years), where I have encountered students who are highly motivated to succeed, students who are so appreciative of my efforts that they have given me countless thank-you cards after the course or when they graduate (I have two boxes full in my closet that I can show you), students who walk me out of the classroom and continue the class discussions because they are genuinely intellectually intrigued, and students who consistently utter, "Hi Mr. Nieves!" when they see me on the escalator, in the hallways, or while passing my classroom while I am teaching. So, if hypothetically a handful of students practice the art of "kissing up to teachers," then it doesn't reflect badly on the student body; it reflects badly only on those students who do so.</p><p>Another problem I have with this is that "kissing up to teachers" can only be successful if the teacher allows it to affect his or her judgment. So saying that Stuyvesant students, "in general, are very good at kissing up to teachers," implies that Stuyvesant teachers are gullible, naive, or lacking in moral compass. This is insulting to the caring, hardworking, and honest colleagues that I have the privilege of working with as well as contrary to what I have experienced. So though there may be attempts at "kissing up to teachers," I doubt these attempts are successful.</p><p>Student ingratiation is never a good thing in academia. My view is that if a student is smart enough to devote his time and energy to practice "kissing up to teachers," then they are smart enough to dedicate that time and energy to figuring out the idiosyncrasies of each teacher and adjusting his academic performance accordingly.</p><p><h4>Rebecca Lindenmulder, French and German </h4></p><p>If a student is kissing up to a teacher, it seems to me that he/she is not sincere in the willingness to be helpful, respectful or interested in the material being taught. The teacher may benefit from the cooperativeness and help of the student in question, but in essence, I think we should try to be sincere in our interactions with others and not act in a certain way purely for personal gain. The intention the student has in how they act out their kissing up may also very well be irrelevant—if the student is kissing up in the form of engagement in class, then their engagement nonetheless merits inclusion in a college recommendation. The actions of the student, although maybe more praiseworthy when not done with only the intent of personal gain, are to be included in any case, as they show the student's level of engagement in their studies. To say their kissing up in the form of engagement will guarantee acceptance into a better college would be misleading—I think a variety of factors come into play there.</p><p><h4>Barbara Garber, Health</h4></p><p>I think it’s very hard to tell the difference between “kissing up” and genuinely being kind to the teacher. In most cases, students who participate often show that they’re engaged in the class rather than trying to show off or “kiss up.” In terms of gift giving, if a student gives me a gift, that shows me that they were willing to spend money and time on me, rather than trying to get a grade boost. In my class, I grade based on the work they do and how well they perform on projects, tests, and homework, as well as their engagement in class. I don’t grade based on favoritism or who gets me what gift. Therefore, “kissing up,” even if it does exist in my class, doesn’t affect how I grade because my grades are based on the effort the student puts into my class.</p><p><h4>Meng Ping Tu, Biology and Neurobiology</h4></p><p>Personally, I prefer students to just write me a thank-you card if they really want to say anything. I feel bad about students spending money to buy any sort of presents for a teacher, and I just don’t think it's necessary because my philosophy is that you all give yourselves a grade. I’m here to guide you to learn and to achieve your learning goals for this particular class, but how much you want to do is up to you.</p><p>The maximum is a little thank-you card. I think that's the best. The best and best is if you make your own thank-you card with crayons and paper. I post that—I tape it on my fridge because I think that, to me, is heart.</p>	Article	394	2018-01-23 02:44:24.917875	2018-01-28 02:50:01.321157
876	﻿Independence, Patriotism, and Deep Sea Fishing Rights  <p>The year is 1776, and the Second Continental Congress has convened in a courtroom in hot, sticky Philadelphia. The Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)’s 2017 fall musical, “1776,” directed by juniors Kareena Singh and Bo Xuan Wu and freshman Clara Yuste, opens to an exhausted, overworked congress slumped over at tables, swatting flies, and wiping the sweat off of their foreheads. It is a setting that is frequently returned to throughout the narrative of the show, which revolves around the events leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence.</p><p>To anyone familiar with American history, the facts are simple: numerous delegates from the original 13 colonies assembled in Pennsylvania and debated briefly before signing the document that shaped our political legacy by asserting our independence from Great Britain. What “1776” attempts to do is give emotional meaning to that distant event, capturing the rivalries and stories of the people involved in it.</p><p>STC’s rendition of the show told this story through an energetic, polished, and wonderfully jovial performance. Every scene was blocked or choreographed thoughtfully, from the kickline in “The Lees of Old Virginia” that always managed to kick John Adams (junior Adam Elsayed) in the face to the seating arrangement in congressional debate scenes that could best be described as organized clutter.</p><p>The set was adorned with carefully crafted historical pieces—the wallpaper, tables, and chairs had an antique element to them, and a detailed painting of the Liberty Bell hung in front of a background of treetops and rolling hills. However, several aspects of the set made no sense, like the wooden column protruding from the center of the backdrop for no apparent reason and the windows floating in midair with no beams or walls to support them.</p><p>A most impressive element of the show was the quality of the music. The band, directed by senior Aidan Amog, junior Jason Kim, and sophomores Cosmo Coen and Sara Stebbins, played with an unparalleled level of professionalism, capturing every musical phrase in a way that adeptly underscored the show’s storyline. From the fanfare prelude to the final bows, the band’s energy consistently carried the show.</p><p>The ensemble numbers were also strong and musically immaculate, and of the singing roles, each voice had something distinctly wonderful to bring to the table. Elsayed’s rich, carrying voice nailed several of the show’s most pivotal moments, like when Adams sat alone and reflected on the possibility of giving up everything he worked for due to a clause in the Declaration that Southern states were unwilling to accept. Adams was also beautifully complemented by the softer vocals of his wife, Abigail Adams (sophomore Zeynep Bromberg), in their numerous duets.</p><p>One standout number was “He Plays the Violin,” Martha Jefferson’s (freshman Mimi Gillies) ode to her husband’s many talents. Gillies’s honey-like voice blossomed at the song’s high notes, resonating through the theater as she blissfully waltzed with an imaginary partner.</p><p>The climax and arguably most enthralling part of the show was when Edward Rutledge (senior Alex Whittington) stood up in front of the Second Continental Congress and belted “Molasses to Rum,” an impassioned anthem in support of slavery. In this electric performance, Whittington’s powerful tenor belt caused the ground to nearly shake, and he used the song’s choreography to convey the exhilarating rush Rutledge gets when recounting his experiences as a slave owner. Through sharp, calculated movements, Whittington depicted Rutledge as simultaneously graceful and maniacal—a brilliant, spine-chilling portrayal.</p><p>There were several shining moments between actors. The character dynamic between John and Abigail Adams unfolded through carefully blocked duets that mimicked their separation and detailed the famous letters they wrote each other. As Abigail crooned to her husband, “Don’t stop writing. It’s all I have,” the bittersweetness of their love was palpable.</p><p>Moreover, energetic, animated background acting and hilarious one-liners like Joseph Hewes’s (Clara Yuste) "Mr. Jefferson, nowhere do you mention deep sea fishing rights. We in North Carolina—" kept the show entertaining and humorous and gave life and dimension to the story. In order for any theatrical piece with a large cast to be brought to life, the actors need to work as an ensemble to paint a three-dimensional, overarching picture, and STC nailed this crucial aspect of the show.</p><p>Through songs, meaningful choreography, and adept historical interpretation, STC effectively conveyed the triumphant story behind the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. It is particularly exciting that much of it is underclassman talent new to the STC spotlight, setting the stage for many phenomenal performances in the years to come.</p>	Article	274	2017-12-03 20:30:45.62466	2017-12-03 20:30:45.62466
997	﻿Preserving a Free and Open Web  <p>It’s been a long day at school, and you sit down to binge watch another season of your favorite show on Netflix. However, instead of that bright red logo welcoming you into bliss, you’re met instead with a loading screen blocking you from your beloved series. In 2014, Comcast customers had their Netflix access slowed down after Netflix wouldn’t pay Comcast for continued high-speed content delivery. Netflix eventually backed down, paying Comcast for infrastructure used to speed up Netflix service. However, in 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stepped in to protect all content providers’ rights with net neutrality.</p><p>Net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers (ISPs) should provide equal access to all websites by delivering them to consumers without preferential treatment or blocking. This principle has ensured that individuals, small businesses, and large corporations have equal footing to best serve consumers. However, the FCC’s vote on December 14 to abolish net neutrality now threatens small businesses, corporations, and internet consumers.</p><p>The Internet has created new opportunities and driven growth for small businesses. Online technologies have allowed small businesses to market, hire, and sell without middlemen directly to consumers, increasing profits. Many small businesses are looking to further expand their online presences. According to the National Small Business Association, over a quarter of small firms are looking to increase their profits by conducting more operations online in 2017. Net neutrality has created this opportunity by leveling the playing field between small businesses and large corporations.</p><p>The end of net neutrality is set to give larger companies a considerable edge by allowing them to pay for faster speeds. According to a research division of Google, consumers are more than 53 percent likely to give up on waiting for content to load after only three seconds, meaning that putting websites in “slow lanes” can deal crushing blows to businesses that cannot afford prioritization. With the passage of net neutrality, ISPs have quietly abandoned their promises not to create fast and slow lanes, opening small businesses to these competitive disadvantages.</p><p>Data cap exemptions, which allow usage of certain websites not to be counted against consumers’ monthly data limits, are another advantage ISPs are looking to offer. Freedom to Tinker reported that after a promotion in South Africa exempted WhatsApp from mobile data usage caps, its usage tripled, likely at the expense of other messaging apps. In an FCC hearing in 2013, Verizon counsel Helgi Walker told the commission that Verizon would be pursuing these forms of preferential treatment if it weren’t for net neutrality regulations. Verizon has already unveiled a mobile data cap exemption service for businesses, and other ISPs are sure to follow. Allowing ISPs to grant artificial advantages to established players creates barriers to entry that entrepreneurs and small businesses cannot afford, drastically limiting the diversity of content the Internet has to offer.</p><p>Net neutrality has also prevented ISPs from abusing their positions in pushing their own services and interests. For example, from 2011 to 2013, Google’s mobile payment app, Google Wallet, was blocked by AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint, who had stakes in the rival payment app Softcard. ISPs now own a plethora of their own competing services like Hulu and DirecTV that compete with private alternatives like Netflix and YouTube. Repealing net neutrality puts the free market competition of the Internet at risk in favor of a select few services operated by major telecom companies. This gutting of the free and fair Internet ultimately harms consumers, who now need to choose between using their favorite services at the cost of slower speeds and higher prices or switching to alternatives preferred by ISPs. By compelling consumers to use services supplied by the largest companies, ISPs will create an environment in which entrepreneurs cannot afford to compete, stifling innovation and allowing incumbent services to charge higher prices.</p><p>The greatest danger posed to individuals, however, is the threat to free speech. For example, Facebook’s Free Basics offers free access to a select few sponsored apps in developing countries, including the Bing search engine and Facebook itself. This trains consumers to use a limited number of services, even if they later switch to more full-featured internet plans, and limits free expression to only what sponsored sites allow. For these reasons, India instated net neutrality policies, banning Free Basics. A more chilling example occured in 2004 when Canadian telecom Telus blocked a website supporting a labor strike against the company. ISPs cannot be trusted to uphold the free speech when their interests conflict with that of the Internet community. Repealing net neutrality allows ISPs to filter the Internet, striking a death blow to the freedom we now enjoy: the freedom to view, post, and share whatever and whenever we like, from memes to political activism to almost anything imaginable.</p><p>Opponents of net neutrality, chiefly telecom officials and lobbyists, argue that Title II, a legal mechanism originally intended for phone companies which was repurposed to implement net neutrality, poses considerable regulatory burden on ISPs, stifling investment in expanding Internet access. To support his deregulatory policies, Ajit Pai, the FCC commissioner, cited one study claiming investments in new infrastructure by the twelve largest ISPs were down five percent over the last two years.</p><p>However, ISPs’ shareholder reports paint a different picture. In December 2015, AT&T told shareholders that it would deploy more fiber-optic cable in 2016 than 2015 and that its future business prospects were not affected by Title II. Similarly, December 2016 reports by Comcast and Charter admitted that Title II fears had been overblown, and the new regulations hadn’t hurt business. Repealing net neutrality fixes a nonexistent problem to the detriment of all but a few telecom companies.</p><p>The American public has the power to challenge this repeal by calling and emailing their elected representatives to push for legislation mandating net neutrality. Republicans have proposed a plan that would ban website blocking, but otherwise repeals net neutrality and thus is similarly damaging to the Internet. Democrats are pushing to reinstate net neutrality in full, but Republican opposition leaves it unlikely to be passed. In the absence of legislative action, the last recourse for the public is to take the issue to the courts. Public agencies like the FCC must have factual reasons for policy changes, and Ajit Pai’s overregulation argument doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In addition, the FCC is required to hold a public commenting period for proposed regulatory changes, but commenting on net neutrality repeal suffered from millions of fake comments which the FCC refused to investigate, and required commenting on limitations to local regulations was not held. In light of these irregularities, states’ attorneys general from Washington to Idaho to New York are planning to sue the FCC over the botched repeal process. The courts need to step in and strike down the repeal of net neutrality to protect the entire Internet ecosystem from collapse.</p>	Article	395	2018-01-23 02:44:39.525785	2018-01-23 02:44:39.525785
1014	﻿Greater Stuyvesant Empire Proclaimed Fascist SU invades other schools and enslaves their students for the service of the Stuyvesant student body. <p>The electrified atmosphere in the theater was palpable as senior and Student Union (SU) chancellor Tahseen Chowdhury walked on stage to address the Stuyvesant body. As he walked toward the podium surrounded by a roost of 500 SU officers, the entire crowd rose in unison to salute him. It was the one year anniversary of Chowdhury’s rise to absolute power. To honor this occasion, Chowdhury officially proclaimed the birth of a Stuyvesant Empire.</p><p>This proclamation has been a long time coming. Chowdhury’s lust for power was too great for the walls of Stuyvesant to hold. Chowdhury installed swaths of high-ranking SU officers as puppet rulers in all of the other specialized high schools—easily dominating their sheer numbers.</p><p>Chowdhury’s rise began at a time of great strife and internal struggle in Stuyvesant. Rampant corruption and political inertia within the SU led to disastrous mismanagement of a few dances.  The disenchanted student body turned to Chowdhury.</p><p>During his junior year, Chowdhury held rallies in the senior atrium where he gave captivating speeches. His supporters demanded access to the student lounge, and in the process, he organized it.</p><p>As a result of his initial goodwill, Chowdhury was unanimously granted full power, which he used to proclaim himself supreme chancellor. Chowdhury purged the SU of its former members and replaced them with his hundreds of supporters. He formed a secret police monitoring other class cutters and drug users. Social studies teacher Matt Polazzo wholeheartedly agreed with his policies, citing the importance of social contract theory in regulating the unruly Stuyvesant community.</p><p>Order had finally been restored, but Chowdhury knew that he could not maintain support for long with his repressive policies. He knew that for his regime to survive, he would have to expand. Using a staged incident in which a group of Brooklyn Tech students beat up a Stuyvesant freshman as casus belli, Chowdhury declared war on Brooklyn Technical High School. He quickly drafted an army with the entire freshman class and invaded the enemy school.</p><p>The students of Brooklyn Tech were brought back to Stuyvesant to be used as personal servants of the student body. Chowdhury justified his actions to the Stuyvesant community by demonstrating that with the help of servants, they would be able to delegate their work, allowing students to go to sleep on time, pass all their exams, and commit to a hundred extracurricular activities at the same time. Chowdhury then passed a rule forbidding teachers to question their students’ appearances, allowing the slaves to take exams for their masters.</p><p>“What am I doing wrong? Why aren’t my students failing? And why do my students look so different when they come in to take my monster exams?” mathematics teacher Glen Chew said in exasperation. Chew has been forced to reverse the MIT curve: 90s have been converted to 81s, 80s to 64s, and so on.</p><p>Student extracurriculars have been ever successful with the introduction of servants. “We’ve never had this many people attend our events before! I can write on my college app that I’ve made this club explode,” junior and Red Cross leader Jerry Ye pointed out.</p><p>The debate team has had to rent out an entire flotilla of school buses to serve the surge of debaters. “I can finally be at a debate tournament and a Red Cross event at the same time. Our supreme chancellor is quite the miracle worker,” junior David Vinokur quipped.</p>	Article	412	2018-01-23 02:57:25.412957	2018-01-23 02:57:25.412957
1019	﻿Greyducks Look to Become More Consistent The Greyducks hope to reach their top form going into the second half of the season. <p>Stuyvesant’s indoor girls’ track team, the Greyducks, traveled to Armory Track on December 27 to compete in the PSAL Holiday Classic. Refreshed from the holidays and the break, the team was determined to succeed at the meet after their rocky and inconsistent start to the season.</p><p>In their first two meets, the team had struggled but got back on track with a solid showing at the Day of Distance on December 23. The team’s placement was erratic again, performing well in some events but struggling in others.</p><p>There were many bright spots for the team, particularly in the varsity events. Senior Daria Shifrina finished fifth out of 14 participants in the high jump with a height of 4 feet, 8 inches and sixth out of 28 participants in the triple jump with a distance of 32 feet, 5 inches. Sophomore Tina Zheng finished 10th out of 33 participants in the weight throw with a distance of 27 feet, 11.5 inches. The Greyducks had a solid showing from their field team and are hoping that will continue as the season progresses.</p><p>In the track portion of the meet, juniors Bernice Chen (8:42:25), Kayla Lew (8:51:36), and Jeanette Cheung (8:55:51) finished third, fourth, and fifth, respectively, out of 20 participants in the 1500-meter racewalk, and junior Clara Mohri finished in second (10:56:58) out of 17 runners in the 3000-meter run. This strong junior class will look to help lead the team both this season and next.</p><p>However, the Greyducks finished in the middle of the pack in events like the 1000-meter run and the 300-meter dash. The team also did not compete in any of the relays. “The season is off to a decent start. We’ve already had several athletes qualify for the PSAL Championships, but we’ve also had a lot of injuries and health issues that have hampered us,” coach Carl DiSarno said.</p><p>Mohri has qualified for the 1500-meter run and the 3000-meter run, Shifrina has qualified for the triple jump, and Chen has qualified for the 1500-meter racewalk. The team will look to send as many members as possible to compete and represent Stuyvesant in the Championships.</p><p>“We’re also a very young team, with lots of freshmen and sophomores, so we’re also still figuring out what everyone is good at,” DiSarno said. A staggering 36 of the 46 athletes on the official roster are underclassmen.</p><p>This inexperience also creates an atmosphere of competitiveness. “We are starting to ramp up the work. We are excited to work to beat our personal records, as well as trying to run good races and potentially qualify for City’s [championships],” freshman Julianne Yotov said. The Greyducks are looking to become more consistent and reach their top form going into the second half of the season as the Borough and City Championships draw even closer.</p>	Article	417	2018-01-23 02:59:20.060322	2018-01-23 02:59:20.060322
1026	﻿Can Phoenix Rise Again After a Rough Start? After a slow, 5-5 start, junior Talia Kirshenbaum’s rebounding presence could be what it takes to push the Phoenix back into contention. <p>When I spoke to senior and co-captain Shannon Lau of the Stuyvesant Phoenix girls’ basketball team back in December, she exuded an infectious hope. “I truly think we have what it takes to reclaim first in our division,” said Lau, as she meticulously detailed the steps that the team planned to take after falling out of first place in the Manhattan A South Division for the first time in three years. Lau sold me on her optimism, citing improvements like head coach Vincent Miller’s new free throw regimen, involving 20-30 free-throws per practice and sprints after missed ones. It seemed as though the Phoenix had put in place an aggressive plan to rectify their woes at the stripe that had plagued them so severely a year ago.</p><p>Unfortunately, 10 games in, the Phoenix’s season has not treated them kindly. Even with a decisive 67-55 victory against Bayard Rustin Educational Complex, the Phoenix have already matched last season’s loss total (five) and have not improved very much at all at the free throw line. Last year, just five players shot over 50 percent on free throws (Lau, senior and co-captain Delaney Demark and juniors Maya Zabari, Ally Archer, and Ruby Gary). Of the five, though, only Lau and Archer received what could be considered substantial reps. This year, that figure is even lower. Zabari and Gary are no longer on the team, and only two players (Lau and junior guard Britni Canale) are shooting over 50 percent on free throws. Considering that Canale has only shot four total free throws, Lau is the only player with free throw shooting success over an extensive span. Not everyone on the team, however, sees free throw shooting as being as pernicious as it may seem. “As a whole, free throw shooting isn’t a very prominent issue, but we could always do better,” Demark said. The team has lost all five games by more than five points, suggesting that the Phoenix slow start could be attributed to something deeper—for instance, a lack of a dominating rebounding presence.</p><p>In the 2016-2017 season, the Phoenix were defined by a frontcourt that dominated the glass. Archer, at center, and junior power forward Talia Kirshenbaum combined for nearly 20 rebounds each game. But Kirshenbaum missed the first eight games of this season while she was at the Mountain School, hurting the team’s rebounding prowess. Archer’s production has increased (12.2 rebounds per game), and the team has enjoyed an unprecedented breakout performance by sophomore Eve Wening, who raised her rebounding numbers by nearly five rebounds per game from a season ago, but they have not matched last year’s totals.</p><p>Kirshenbaum returned to the team in mid-January in thunderous fashion. Albeit in a minuscule sample size, she has averaged 14 rebounds per game, the highest by any Phoenix over the past four years. It has had a profound impact on the rest of the team, which has been markedly more competitive as of late. The dominant 67-55 win came against a respectable Bayard Rustin team which has hovered around .500 all season, and the 54-48 loss to Graphics Campus came against a high-powered, 9-2 team whose only losses came at the hands of 10-2 Millennium High School and undefeated Lab Museum United. Furthermore, according to Demark, the loss to Graphics Campus might have been close enough for free throw shooting to have played a role: “In Monday’s game against Graphics, free throw shooting did prove to be a bit of an issue, but that’s really the only instance this season in which this significantly impacted the outcome of the game,” Demark said. It’s safe to say that Kirshenbaum’s return has been felt by everyone on Stuyvesant’s roster. “What Talia’s doing on this team is crazy,” Lau said.</p><p>Ultimately, Kirshenbaum’s return could be what revitalizes the Phoenix back into championship contention. The three-headed monster of Kirshenbaum and Archer both potentially putting up double-digit rebounds and Wening coming off the wing with countless more could be a fearsome mismatch going forward, and this could spark a streak of success into February. “I’m confident that we can bring this perseverance across the remainder of the season,” Lau said.</p><p>In the end, though, only time will tell how dramatic such a turnaround will be. In the next seven games, the Phoenix play just two teams with winning records: Millennium High School and Seward Park Campus. If they can sweep the other five games, they should cruise into the playoffs. However, if they slip up, it could spell a low seed in the playoffs, and perhaps an early ticket home.</p>	Article	424	2018-01-23 03:03:47.150845	2018-01-23 03:03:47.150845
661	﻿Stuyvesant Incoming Class: A Closer Look Café Amore, a pizzeria between Greenwich and West Broadway on Chambers Street, has seen a 300 percent increase in patrons, corresponding to a trend seen... <p>Café Amore, a pizzeria between Greenwich and West Broadway on Chambers Street, has seen a 300 percent increase in patrons, corresponding to a trend seen by other usually unfashionable establishments such as Terry’s, the fifth floor cafeteria, and BMCC students selling candy to jumpstart their music careers. These new customers have been described as young teenagers, aged 13-14, with large JanSport backpacks, anime character profile pictures on Facebook, and an obsession with the online video game and salt mine “League of Legends.” They can be found in the sixth floor library, asking upperclassmen for the Wi-Fi password, or in the stairways making their way to the newly constructed 12th floor pool. They are the Stuyvesant Incoming Class of 2021, and they’re ready to take Stuyvesant by storm.</p><p>These new students come from all over the city and represent dozens of different countries, five different boroughs; they have a shared belief that they will be graduating as valedictorian, getting eight hours of sleep every night, and going to Harvard, while seeing their fellow 800 classmates as giant nerds.</p><p>One such student is freshman Noa Morris. Unlike the thousands of sophomores and upperclassmen at Stuyvesant High School, Morris was legitimately enthusiastic to be featured here in The Spectator.</p><p>Morris was found waiting in line at Terry’s, which she chose as her deli of choice over Gourmet Market, commonly dubbed “Fake Terry’s.” “The last thing I would want is something fake, whether it be a deli, clothing, or friends,” said Morris, while sporting a fake Obey hat and Supreme x Stuyvesant Student Union hoodie licensed solely by Student Union President Tahseen Chowdhury as an attempt to raise funds for his state senate campaign.</p><p>In her free time, Morris actively enjoys using the library computers to browse Reddit and post about what extracurriculars will help her get into college while a struggling junior desperately needs to finish his English paper. The aspiring student plans to graduate a year in advance, but is currently struggling due to a failing grade in swim gym.</p>	Article	23	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

But alas, as I prepare myself for inevitably re-entering those Doors of Doom, Death, and Despair, I must come to terms with our impending separation.</p><p>Allow me to anticipate my onsetting mental breakdown by recounting our time together, so I can proceed to waste what little time I have left wallowing in self-pity and an endless barrage of memes.</p><p>I will admit I cannot remember much about our first week together, as I spent 95 percent of it asleep. The highly concentrated cocktail of stress and crippling depression that I had been consuming over the last 10 months resulted in quite the hangover.</p><p>However, by the time week two rolled around, I began to have a slow recovery. I was invigorated by a rare motivation to make positive life changes, such as finally getting off the couch. Unfortunately, it turns out that exercising feels like hell, so that plan was quickly scrapped.</p><p>I then decided to be productive for once in my life. I spent a solid 35.827 seconds thinking about how I should really start studying for the year ahead. With your love by my side, I confidently ordered a Barron’s book that still sits peacefully undisturbed on my desk and has peeked out my window for a record-breaking three milliseconds.</p><p>Alas, like any relationship, we went through our ups and downs. We had our disagreements, like that time you scorched my face off and I spent a solid week more burnt than Trump’s eyes after the eclipse. Despite it all, my undying devotion to you does not change, and I am again reaching a near-catatonic state at the thought of leaving you.</p><p>Maybe the most heartbreaking aspect of our separation is that it obligates me to face the workload I have been desperately avoiding. It appears that the high temperatures did nothing to  reverse my sluggish, apathetic nature, so I accomplished a grand total of zero tasks over the course of vacation. As a result, as I move into the abusive rebound that is The Fall, I still have to memorize all of the information inside my AP prep books, figure out what this “SAT” thing is (Sweat, Agony, Tears?), purchase an IKEA book shelf which can store my 23 million pages of AP Euro review sheets and 91 Crash Course volumes, adopt and register a bear as a support animal in order to survive junior year, construct a stroller (cage?) for said bear to bring it to school, acquire a piloting license so that I can fly away from my problems, build a time-travel machine so that I can prevent that one time I tripped on stage at my elementary school graduation from happening, write a letter to Dreamworks demanding an explanation as to why Artie wasn’t given more screen time in Shrek the Third, master kung-fu, and become a legendary painter tutored by the one and only Bob Ross (through my time-travel machine, of course).</p><p>Normally, I would blame not getting anything done on my tendency to procrastinate and avoid any sense of responsibility like the Black Death. However, this time around, I am blaming you—I was seduced by your warm beaches and sunny frolic-worthy green fields, forgetting all of my worries. I think you really might be a bad influence.</p><p>Honestly, I’m finding it a little hard to not be bitter about your fear of commitment. I mean, can’t you stay year round? Instead, it feels our time together passed by quicker than Scaramucci’s stay in the White House. But, like all good things, our relationship too is nearing its end. Don’t worry about me; I’ve already planned out coping with our break-up by ugly-crying and consuming alarming quantities of ice cream during the first week of school. So now, I’ll set you free and say good-bye, marking June 26 on my calendar for when I shall see you again.</p><p>Always yours,</p><p>Gaby</p>	Article	24	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
663	﻿Dear Incoming Class of 2021…We Don’t Really Have Advice! A summary of the totally useful and helpful posts that are in the “Dear Incoming Class of 2021...We Have Advice!” Facebook group. <p>With every new school year comes a new wave of extremely helpful posts in the “Dear Incoming Class of 2021...We Have Advice!” Facebook group. As the incoming freshmen excitedly pack their wheelie bags full of thick three-ring binders, veteran Stuyvesant students search their brains for prime advice to give.</p><p>The freshmen have been bombarded with extremely useful advice such as “Stuy sucks, transfer out” and “hey guys, join the slime club.” While 99 percent of the posts in the Class of 2021 group are completely necessary and not at all redundant, every once in a while, some rising sophomore makes a totally hilarious joke about bringing a tent to Camp Stuy.</p><p>Another type of post that is common in the Facebook group is advertisements for sports teams. “Whenever I’m feeling depressed about college apps, I go into the 2021 advice group and make a post about the cross country team to cheer myself up,” senior Amy Ren said. “I mean, I can only write seven Common App drafts a day before feeling like I’m a failure, amiright?”</p><p>Nevertheless, freshmen often ask questions on how to join sports teams or other clubs. “I know there have been 13 other posts about the swimming team, but I have a rare psychological disorder that prevents me from scrolling down,” freshman Leo Yuan said. “It’s called being a little s***.”</p><p>For some upperclassmen, the incoming class group is not seen so much as a helpful tool for freshmen, but as a source of fun. “When I see a naive and innocent post by a hopeful freshman, I can’t help but tear it apart and laugh,” sophomore Eugene Seo said. “One time I saw this girl ask ‘how do I make friends at Stuy,’ so I commented ‘you don’t HA GOT EM AYY LMAO WHOMST IS THIS SCRUB’ along with a picture of the freshman’s head as a fidget spinner. Then, I gave myself a high five every time someone liked my comment.”</p><p>Another popular question found in the advice group is: “What type of school supplies should I buy?” In response, several upperclassmen have answered with “just continually mooch paper and pencils off your classmates until they eventually shun you.”</p>	Article	25	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
664	﻿Spider-Man: How A High School Setting Brings The Franchise to its Peak “Spider-Man: Homecoming” stands out from other superhero movies in that its protagonist accurately portrays the character of a high school student. <p>Imagine how you’d feel if a high-ranking executive of a well-known corporation, such as Apple, noticed your talent and promised to get in touch with you in the near future. Then, imagine your disappointment if that official were to cut off communication with you altogether.</p><p>If you’ve managed to do this, you have captured the exact feelings of Peter Parker in “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”</p><p>“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” directed by Jon Watts, revolves around Peter Parker (played by Tom Holland), a 15-year-old high school student, trying to prevent Vulture (played by Michael Keaton) from dealing dangerous weapons involving alien technology in order to prove himself worthy of becoming an Avenger.</p><p>It is hard to imagine how a second reboot of the Spider-Man franchise could stand out from its predecessors in any way. However, in the first “Spider-Man” trilogy directed by Sam Raimi, Peter Parker is depicted as a photographer who had just graduated high school. In “The Amazing Spider-Man” series directed by Marc Webb, Peter Parker is portrayed as a high school student. “Spider-Man: Homecoming” manages to stand out from not just the previous Spider-Man movies, but also movies of the superhero genre, by focusing on Spider-Man as a high school sophomore.</p><p>For example, unlike in the first “Spider-Man” trilogy where Spider-Man is granted the power of organic webbing, in this version, Parker secretly creates his own web fluid in chemistry class and hides it beneath his locker. In addition, when Parker finds out that Vulture is in Maryland thanks to his secretly implanted tracker, he makes a last-minute decision to accompany the decathlon team to its national academic tournament in Washington, D.C. The movie ties in aspects of Parker’s second life with his school life so well that it makes it seem as though Spider-Man cannot exist without his counterpart role as a high school student.</p><p>In “Captain America: Civil War,” Parker is taken out on his first Avengers-related fight by Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries, leaving Peter with a thirst for more missions, a theme that “Spider-Man: Homecoming” expands upon. Throughout the film, Parker repeatedly attempts to prove himself to Stark by ending Vulture’s arms trafficking business. His need to show he is more than just someone trying to protect his neighborhood is a reflection of how a majority of teenagers believe they are more than just “children.”</p><p>Many teenagers attempt to make their own life choices in order to be more independent and to show their maturity. Peter is not an exception, making many rash decisions to put his job as a superhero first, stating, “I am so far beyond high school right now.” He quits band, hangs out with his best friend Ned (played by Jacob Batalon) less frequently, refuses to participate in the national academic decathlon tournament with his team before finding out about Vulture’s location, and even skips class—all in order to commit more time to combatting criminals as Spider-Man.</p><p>The most prominent example of this kind of decision-making is in regards to his suit. In order to keep Stark from shutting down his quest to defeat Vulture, Parker disables his suit’s tracking device and shuts down the suit’s “Training Wheels Protocol,” which had previously prevented him from using its more advanced features, such as shooting different kinds of webs and enhancing hearing and sight. Trying to unlock features he was not prepared for at his skill level caused him to be at a constant loss during the action sequence that followed and ultimately lead to Vulture escaping and Parker being stuck in a storage vault.</p><p>However, the reckless mistakes he makes to validate his role as a superhero make his maturing all the more gratifying. After apprehending Vulture, Parker realizes he does not need to be an Avenger in order to be a good superhero. Thus, at the end of the movie, when he turns down Stark’s offer to become a member of the Avengers, Peter truly illustrates how much he has grown. By no longer feeling the need to prove he is capable of fighting crime on a larger scale, Peter overcomes one obstacle on the long road to maturity, creating a satisfying ending.</p><p>One may argue that simply changing the age of a main character cannot possibly affect the quality of a movie to such a large degree; but in this case, changing the age impacts the movie by making it more appealing to its audience.</p><p>The scenario used at the beginning of the article shouldn’t have been too hard to visualize. Many high school students, especially those in competitive schools like Stuyvesant, will go through or have already gone through the struggle of trying to get themselves noticed by high-status officials, whether it be through research papers or project ideas. So when Parker tries to get his efforts and talents noticed by Stark in attempt after attempt, the majority of the audience—who are either high school students or have been in high school—will be able to empathize with Parker, creating a larger emotional payoff for Parker’s eventual success in proving himself.</p><p>“Spider-Man: Homecoming” is vastly different from the preceding films of the franchise. By weaving the experience of a high school student into the storyline of a savior of Queens, it creates its own unique charm and leaves a greater impact on its audience through its relatability.</p>	Article	16	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
665	﻿What We Should Learn From Last Year in Politics  <p>As the last polling stations closed on Tuesday, November 8, The New York Times forecast that Hillary Clinton had an 85 percent chance of winning the White House, FiveThirtyEight gave Clinton a 71 percent chance of victory, and Reuters topped it off at 90 percent. It seemed as though Democrats were poised for victories in both chambers of Congress. The 2016 election was meant to be a watershed victory for progressivism and the beginning of a new liberal future for America.</p><p>Instead, Donald Trump rode into power on a wave of discontent as the leader of a conservative resurgence. The election marked the pinnacle of a trend of increasing partisanship and a disturbing aversion to compromise. Since then, every day has been a pitched battle between ideological extremes that has brought our government to a standstill and threatens the stability of our country. While it may be tempting to take your gloves off, it is imperative that we begin the process of reconciliation to forge a bipartisan future for America.</p><p>How did we get here?</p><p>Most of us—regardless of where we stand on the political spectrum—can agree that the last election was complete chaos. Tensions brewed: Clinton ignorantly described Trump’s base as “basket of deplorables,” and Trump called on the “Second Amendment people” to assassinate a potential President Hillary Clinton. This kind of slander should come without surprise, however. Insolence has become the defining character of this era’s political atmosphere. The American public has been caught between partisanship’s superficial entanglements. Both Clinton and Trump were the most unpopular nominations of their respective parties in the modern era, and both parties have shunned the slightest diversity of thought, the slightest divergence from their agendas.</p><p>The entrenched partisanship belies the reality that independents constitute nearly half of Americans. As Democrats have grown increasingly liberal, and Republicans have grown increasingly conservative, independents have become increasingly ostracized from political participation. The party bloc has become the default interface of American politics, where legislation is hammered out in party chambers rather than on the floors of Congress. Discussions no longer involve the actual effects of policy, but rather fixate around vote numbers and the interests of party leaders. With the recent passing of the American Healthcare Act, for example, there was no final score of the bill on the floor of the House; Republicans were nonetheless rallied to vote for it along party lines by House Speaker Paul Ryan.</p><p>Gerrymandering—the redrawing of district boundaries along partisan lines—has, in part, made political extremism expedient. Gerrymandering limits competition by cramming as many opposition voters into small districts as possible. Congressional districts. like North Carolina’s 12th and Maryland’s 3rd, often snake across hundreds of miles in a desperate bid to pack like-minded people together. This safeguards the position of the majority party and artificially polarizes voters by ideology. By isolating the populace into two distinct halves, parties are free to pander to their base and force people to vote for their increasingly extremist and narrow-minded agendas. While it is easy to balk at the policies of the other party, platforms that were sure political suicide a few years ago are now the mainstream.</p><p>Our detachment from one another is exacerbated by the cycle of fear and distrust peddled by politicians and media outlets. While pundits were quick to attack the divisive and incendiary coverage put forth by fringe organizations, like Breitbart, during the election cycle, many mainstream media outlets have also become troublingly political and biased. A Pew Research poll indicates that 74 percent of Americans believe news organizations favor one side of the political spectrum. The clickbait headlines mocking liberals and bashing conservatives have made politics dangerously entertaining and addictive. By spewing information with a partisan slant, the modern media forces us to live in our pre-existing biases. While external factors have tainted our political climate, new ideological rifts have shaken up internal party politics as well.</p><p>The stunning Democratic loss can be attributed to the exclusionary splintering within the party. Bernie Sanders’ campaign electrified young and progressive-minded Democrats and found large support amongst white Rust Belters and independents. Clinton’s nomination disillusioned many of Sanders’ supporters, likely costing the Democrats the critical states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Post-election, the Democratic party has failed to learn from its failure, choosing instead to abandon its status as the “big-tent party,” the evolved descendent of Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition. The new Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Tom Perez has claimed that all Democrats have to be pro-choice, alienating roughly 20 percent of Democrats that are pro-life. Furthermore, the far left has become more and more outspoken, alienating Democrats who do not believe in identity politics.</p><p>The political infighting that led to Trump’s election has also severely hurt Republicans. Recent polls have shown severe dissatisfaction even in the states Trump carried: President Trump polls at 41 approve/51 disapprove in North Carolina, 44 approve/47 disapprove in Wisconsin, 41 approve/47 disapprove in Florida, and—shockingly—42 approve/54 disapprove in the consistently Republican Texas. The “Never Trump” movement never picked up steam as a result of the seventeen candidates running for the nomination. Trump managed to stand out from the carbon-copy playing field, directly demonstrating the power of extremism in swaying voters.</p><p>So, what can we learn?</p><p>Polarization has led to dissension, as near-majorities of Americans find discussing politics with those with opposing political views to be “stressful and frustrating” (Pew Internet Research). Clashing with our ideological foes over Twitter can be exhausting and the thought of retreating to our favorite InfoWars or DailyKos story may seem appealing. It is critical, however, that we take the initiative to step out of our political echo chambers and reach out to one another in order to better understand other opinions and the very causes that we claim to be fighting for.</p><p>To truly advance an agenda and realistically implement our vision for the world, Americans must accept bipartisanship. By distancing ourselves from ideological extremes and embracing centrism—a tolerance of ideas we may not openly support—we can communicate with each other and expand the reach of our goals and outlook. At the same time, moderates cannot be marginalized and coerced into acceding to the whims of an extremist minority. Rather, it is important for moderates to stand steadfastly by the principles of political centrism and by the belief in the superiority of compromise over partisan bickering.</p><p>That being said, the two-party political system has been a longstanding part of American politics since 1789 for good reason—it’s often the simplest way to broadcast opinions and effectuate broad changes. In this way, the two-party system has been working very well in convincing Americans to accept wide-sweeping agendas.</p><p>The Trump presidency serves as a wake-up call to understand these failures of partisanship, however. From this point on, it is important for Democrats and Republicans to truly comprehend the basis of their beliefs in order to form a bipartisan compromise. Staunch Democrats should be questioning their beliefs not to become Trump apologists, but to understand their position to be able to better argue and support it. Staunch Republicans should do the same to be able to offer objective defenses of the Trump administration. In effect, many partisan voters will end up abandoning the longstanding hard-set party lines, better reflecting the reality that political identification is on a wide spectrum and not in two camps.</p><p>Indeed, a multitude of similarities do exist: most Americans support infrastructure developments, education investments, responsible economics, amongst other tenets. Most importantly, Americans share an interest in the betterment of the nation. As President Obama famously quipped, “there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.”</p><p>———————————————————————————————————————</p><p>Timeline</p><p>“A Buildup in Partisanship”</p><p>2009:</p><p>Jan 28: House Democrats passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—an $831 billion stimulus package to rejuvenate the economy after the Great Recession—without a single Republican vote.</p><p>2010:</p><p>Mar 22: After a contentious debate, the House voted 219-212 to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, allowing President Obama to sign healthcare reform, or Obamacare, into law.

666	﻿See Ya, School!: A Stuyvesant Student’s Guide to Summer Cinematics This summer will feature the release of many incredible movies as a refreshing break from the past school year. <p>The past school year has been a particularly difficult one, especially considering the additional stress of a billionaire Cheeto being elected President of the United States. However, this summer, Stuyvesant students can take a breather from the stress of school with some of this year’s most anticipated movies, ranging from action-packed hero blockbusters to potential Oscar-worthy notables by some of Hollywood’s most renowned directors.</p><p>To all students seeking another reason to welcome the start of summer, here are six movies everyone should be on the lookout for to keep you refreshed during the upcoming break.</p><p>“Wonder Woman” (June 2, 2017)</p><p>DC fans are already migrating to the cinemas this month with the release of “Wonder Woman,” a brand-new film centering around everyone’s favorite Amazon heroine. Gal Gadotmade a stunning appearance in “Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice” as Wonder Woman, and now she finally earns the spotlight in this early summer release. When war pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), USS Enterprise captain of this generation’s “Star Trek” films, crash lands on Themyscira, Wonder Woman’s home island, he tells her of the conflict going on outside her island’s borders. Skilled, mature, and ready to become the hero the world needs, Diana of the Amazons leaves her island and travels to assist the outside world in resolving this massive conflict. Those who buy tickets will watch as Diana, sword and whip in hand, cements her name in history and earns the title of Wonder Woman—always ready to lead and prepared for war.</p><p>“Baby Driver” (June 28, 2017)</p><p>Get ready for the ride of your life with this upcoming release directed by Edgar Wright.  Known for his unconventional and brilliant movie ideas, Wright, director of the Cornetto Trilogy, has brought to the big screens another pinnacle of entertainment, a movie about a young man named Baby (Ansel Elgort), who at the start of the movie is making a living driving a getaway car for a group of thieves. Baby is a genius driver, able to maneuver between two trucks with one turn of his wheel and drive just as good backward as he can forward. For this reason, he is the only driver who Doc (Kevin Spacey), Baby’s boss, is willing to use for his criminal activities. When a new love enters his life, Baby needs to decide whether he’ll keep his distance before she’s put in danger, or if he’ll go out and face the music, cutting himself loose from Doc’s grip on him and his talents. With an A-list cast including Jamie Foxx from “Ray” and Jon Hamm from “Mad Men,” watch Baby take to the wheels and rev up for the drive of his life.</p><p>“Despicable Me 3” (June 30, 2017)</p><p>Despite the Minions being an extremely overused, and frankly annoying, advertising tactic, the third installment in the “Despicable Me” animated comedy series actually seems amusing with a few interesting new characters. Despite former supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) becoming a devoted husband and father and a crime-fighting secret agent over the course of the previous two “Despicable Me” movies, he is temporarily swayed back to the villainous side with the introduction of his wealthy long-lost twin brother, Dru (also Steve Carell). Dru wishes for Gru’s help with one last heist: stealing a jewel from the latest flashy villain who looks as if he’s been pulled straight out of the ‘80s, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker). With Dru’s more positive attitude and incompetence contrasting heavily with Gru’s very serious nature, the new brotherly rivalry may add a fresh and humorous dynamic to the film.</p><p>“Spider-Man: Homecoming” (July 7, 2017)</p><p>This summer, Tom Holland suits up yet again as the boy genius from Queens with a spider bite that has given him powers beyond his imagination. After the events of “Captain America: Civil War,” Peter Parker is stuck back in his normal life as an NYC high schooler (we all know how boring that can get), when a new bad guy (Michael Keaton) comes to town, ready to crush the one people call “Spider-Man” by any means necessary. If you go to watch this film, one cool thing to keep in mind is that Tom Holland took it upon himself to do his own stunts for the movie. Also, composer Michael Giacchino has changed the original iconic Spider Man score, giving it a refreshing modern twist.</p><p>“Dunkirk” (July 21, 2017)</p><p>Operation Dynamo, the Allies’ successful evacuation mission in Dunkirk, France, from May 26 to June 4, 1940, was wrought with thousands of casualties. Christopher Nolan’s World War II film sheds some light on this historic tragedy. It depicts the desperation of thousands of Allied troops on land, at sea, and in the air struggling to endure constant attack from the Nazis. Some especially evocative scenes shown in trailers include dozens of soldiers on a ship bracing for an explosion and troops respecting the deaths of their fellow fallen, letting them drift off to sea. The film is a massive project with an impressive cast, including “Star Wars” actor Tom Hardy and former One Direction member Harry Styles. Furthermore, with Nolan opting for genuine battleships and historic locations over the usual Hollywood CGI effects, “Dunkirk” is bound to be hauntingly realistic.</p><p>“Atomic Blonde” (July 28, 2017)</p><p>Who said women couldn’t be kickass undercover spies? This thriller film, based on the graphic novel “The Coldest City,” by Antony Johnston, takes place toward the end of the Cold War, very close to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron), a MI6 spy, with the reluctant help of pugnacious Berlin station chief David Percival (James McAvoy), is sent to Berlin to identify and take out an espionage ring that has killed another MI6 agent. Scenes from the film depict Theron’s character as a ruthless, skillful woman. She displays her incredible martial arts prowess by beating up big, burly men and shooting agents in slow motion while still staying stylish in her stiletto heels. In addition, as shown by a sex scene involving her and another woman, Lorraine is not only one of the few female spies in media, but also one of the first LGBTQ+ spies. With a fitting ‘80s soundtrack and fantastic usages of dim and bright neon lighting, “Atomic Blonde” looks to be a spy film on par with a “James Bond” movie.</p>	Article	145	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

The atmosphere of the cafe is very casual and welcoming, with several cozy tables and wooden benches to sit on. Bibble and Sip is perfect for small get-togethers and on-the-go runs alike.</p><p>Giant Cream Puffs</p><p>$3.50</p><p>Bibble and Sip is famous for its huge cream puffs, setting them out at noon every day and attracting long lines of customers. The pastry itself is buttery and has a crunchy top, and the filling is very rich and smooth. They come in four flavors: black sesame, matcha green tea, Earl Grey, and dark chocolate, though they almost always run out of the chocolate flavor. At less than $4.00 for a cream puff almost as big as your entire hand, it is both a good treat and a good investment.</p><p>Chocolate Black-Out Cake</p><p>$5.25</p><p>In this dessert, layers of creamy chocolate mousse alternate with layers of cake. For the final touch, three squares of dark chocolate are placed at an angle upon swirls of chocolate icing. There are few things in life that are more luxurious than a good chocolate cake, and Bibble and Sip does this saying justice, proving that just chocolate can be a great meal.</p><p>Orange Cranberry Scone</p><p>$2.95</p><p>Orange and cranberry is not a flavor combination you would find in most things, but it works well in this baked good. The flour in the scone is balanced by the natural tanginess and sweetness of the fruits as well as the Earl Grey glaze that is drizzled on top.</p><p>Tea</p><p>$2.75</p><p>Unlike most drinks offered at cafes, the teas served here are not overwhelmingly sweet. The Japan Green Apple and Earl Grey flavors are my favorites.</p>	Article	156	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
668	﻿The Video Game Changer  <p>It was pouring rain—the kind of day where you just want to pull the covers over your head and play video games. So I was surprised to see hundreds of people actually leave their console to show up at the first ever Tribeca video games festival.</p><p>Billed as a “festival within a festival,” the legendary Tribeca Film Festival launched a games fest for the first time ever.</p><p>Some may consider video games the most fun thing in his or her repetitive, mundane life, while others may think they are an addictive waste of time. Either way, the intellectuals and artists who run the Tribeca Film Festival think that video games are the latest and greatest art form.</p><p>While the term “video game festival” evokes a bunch of nerds gawking at new games and consoles, this video games festival was far from what you may have envisioned.</p><p>Just one hour was devoted to the actual playing of video games, and many were unknown titles that have yet to be released. The lines were so long that most people didn’t even get a chance to play.</p><p>The focus of the festival, rather, is the process of creating games from an intellectual standpoint—an opportunity to see into the brain of game creators, game writers, and game directors—and find out what inspired them.</p><p>The giant conference room was actually a large sound stage used for filming movies and commercials in Soho. They put a thousand folding chairs in and a portable stage with some indoor palm trees, converting into a functional space for an eager video game audience.</p><p>They were not too many teens. It was mostly people in their 20s and 30s who must have been very, very serious about video games as a new emerging kind of interactive film. After all, they gave up a perfectly good Saturday to see the legends of game creation lecture.</p><p>There was a cappuccino bar with free nutella crepes where everybody, especially people dressed in hip, black film director outfits, could opine about videos. You could tell I was the only high school student because I was the only one stuffing the free nutella candy bars into my pockets.</p><p>One fellow named Michael Swayner of Brooklyn and his posse of two guys were dressed as if they were attending a networking event for artsy professionals. I asked them why they made time in their schedule to purchase some pricey tickets for the event, and they told me that they thought it was time that video games got the respect they deserved.</p><p>I asked Michael what his favorite game was and he said that it was family time around Super Mario when he was a kid. His siblings were very competitive and the fun they had trying to outdo each other is the gaming adventure that mattered the most. This wasn’t a response that reflected the supposed serious nature of video game creation that he had come to the festival to experience. However, it was a response that I could relate to.</p><p>Another guy named Juan, from Queens and in his early college years, told us that video games were most important for their magic stress-reducing properties. He said you should start playing because you forget your troubles for a while. He also felt it was a world he could control when he was younger—the only thing he felt he had some control over back then.</p><p>We all rushed into the stage area to take our seats for the biggest draw of the festival.</p><p>Hideo Kojima is the creator of “Metal Gear” and “Silent Hill,” games that changed the industry since they were the first to use live actors instead of 3D models. This gave all games a much more realistic feel. When he took the stage, the audience members leapt to their feet with a standing ovation. I was excited to see him in person. He talked to the crowd through an interpreter about how his childhood was marked by the mandatory viewing of films: his parents refused to let him go to bed until he had screened several a day.</p><p>Kojima also told us that he was allowed to take a bus from his village to the city when he was only three years old to see a movie while his parents were at work. That fueled a lifelong obsession with films.</p><p>By his teen years, Kojima said he was binging on films like “Taxi Driver,” watching them seven times each, for a different creative focus each time. It soon became clear that he would do whatever it takes to become a film director. And he told the crowd that he was particularly obsessed with Robert DeNiro. Deniro founded the Tribeca Film Festival, which is why Kojima agreed to fly in all the way from Tokyo.</p><p>We have the high cost of film production to thank for Kojima’s transformation into video game design. He couldn’t afford to make a two-hour film, so he used his ideas, complete with film actors, to create games.</p><p>That made him the very first game designer to use actors as the models for game characters. As he gained more success, he started using famous actors in the games.</p><p>Kojima also had the vision to turn the industry from games like “pong” to games with powerful and complex storylines, Metal Gear being an early example.</p><p>The audience asked a lot of questions about this, particularly about why he spent big money on actor Kiefer Sutherland instead of using 3D models.</p><p>Kojima said that actors bring their own interpretation to a role, thereby adding an extra layer of creativity and realism—something he just couldn’t get from a 3D model.</p><p>The audience was heavily into the corporate politics of game creation, and the huge news in this world was Kojima’s acrimonious split after 30 years with game company Konami, after much turmoil between him and the organization. This became a big deal around the world because Kojima kept winning awards but was not allowed to go up to the podium and accept them—Konami was portrayed as a group of corporate bad guys. Fans and gaming companies joined in the protest against Konami.</p><p>Some members of the audience told me that they were annoyed to see that this was not addressed on the podium—I learned later that the legal resolution required Kojima to keep his mouth shut regarding those events.</p><p>Kojima finally broke away from that oppressive work situation and he will be releasing his first ever game created by his new indie gaming design group. He toyed with us by saying that he will now reveal something about the new game.</p><p>But all he’d say was: it will have characters and a plot. The audience laughed at the ongoing secrecy. We are all rooting for him and hope the game smashes records and crushes Konami.</p><p>The second big panel, which drove the crowd back from the free snack area and into their seats, featured Ken Levine, writer and director of BioShock, a first-person shooter series set in an underwater dystopia.</p><p>He was paired with action movie director Doug Limon for a compare-and-contrast discussion of movie-making with game creation. Limon is the producer and director of “Edge of Tomorrow” and the “Bourne Identity” franchise. It was exciting to see giants of their perspective industries paired together to talk about the differences in game creation and movie-making.</p><p>Levine told the crowd that the main difference between game creation and movie-making is the lack of glamour.</p><p>Levine said that after a star-studded premiere, everyone kisses up to the director. But for a game writer, the end of the production process is only heralded by a bunch of bloggers going online and making fun of your new game.</p><p>Limon countered that screening a film at a premiere with an unhappy star is no picnic. Angelina Jolie, he said, was so unhappy with footage from a scene of “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” that she burst into tears while sitting next to him.</p><p>As we left the festival, Michael Swayner felt that “it’s time that gaming got more respect as an art form.” He followed up by saying this should be so “because everyone who plays video games is part of the creation process.”</p><p>Our ability to participate and manipulate the storyline of a video game is, indeed, a game changer for the industry that our generation has shaped. And if it really morphs into an enhanced art form of interactive films, we will all have had a hand—not to mention a thumb—in that transformation.</p>	Article	148	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
669	Peglegs Lace Up for Upcoming Season As school starts up again, the Stuyvesant boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs, prepare for another strong season. <p>The end of summer means the beginning of a new season for Stuyvesant’s boys’ soccer team, the Peglegs. Each year, boys from all grades attend tryouts in the hopes of earning a spot on the coveted team, which competes in the PSAL Manhattan A1 division.</p><p>At the end of last year’s soccer season, the Peglegs were ranked third in their division, with a record of eight wins to four losses. The team was the 21st seed in the playoffs, and the Peglegs played their first playoff game against the 12th seed, Staten Island Tech (SIT). Unfortunately, their playoff run was ended by a 4-0 loss to SIT.</p><p>Though the team lost six important seniors this year, it still has a strong starting lineup, composed of many returning players alongside some younger faces. “I've played with some of the players for four years now, and I know exactly how to play with them,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said.</p><p>The team has prioritized specific skills for the coming year. “We need to improve on keeping the ball once we get out of our half and our offense in general. We tend to get a bit sloppy in the final third of the field, but I'm confident we can solidify this by the beginning of the season,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzburg said.</p><p>Gillow agreed, reflecting on improvements that can be made from prior years and their playing. “I think the most improvement is needed on offense and possession of the ball in particular,” Gillow said. “In recent years, our offense has struggled at times to score, but I think we've learned as [a] unit what works and what doesn't going forward.”</p><p>The team’s first game this year is against Julia Richman Education Complex (JREC) on September 10. Last year, the team fared well against JREC, winning both of the season meets. The Peglegs have learned from their weaknesses last year, becoming more comfortable as a team and working toward a better playoff outcome.</p>	Article	26	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
670	﻿Your Guide to the 2017 NFL Season Max says things he thinks… and probably will be wrong (again) <p>There was no chance anyone could beat the Seattle Seahawks in 2014. They were coming off a blowout Super Bowl win and were only getting better with experience. Yet the Patriots knocked them off in Super Bowl XLIV.</p><p>There was no team near the New England Patriots in 2015. Everyone thought they were too good for the rest of the league. Yet the Panthers became the alpha dogs, going 15-1, and the Pats didn’t even make it to the Super Bowl, losing to the eventual champions, the Denver Broncos.</p><p>Then, one year later, the Carolina Panthers were the alpha dogs. Everyone put their money on the top defense led by reigning MVP Cam Newton. Who could stop them?</p><p>Well, it turns out everyone could. They went 6-10 while the Deflategate-hampered Pats blew through the competition on their way to a Super Bowl victory.</p><p>And here we are today: the Pats sit as defending champs and alpha dogs and are overwhelmingly favored to win it all. So before we go on and crown them repeat champions, let’s remember history and consider there’s always someone waiting to knock off the preseason favorite.</p><p>Going into the season, the Patriots added some star players, wide receiver Brandin Cooks and cornerback Stephon Gilmore, so as far as repeats go, things look good. However, they lost running back LeGarrette Blount, and Tom Brady has hit the age of 40, so there are signs of decay in Foxborough. Outside of them in the AFC East, the Dolphins are good, but not great, the Bills aren’t worth talking about, and the Jets would be lucky to win three games.</p><p>The Steelers are an interesting challenger, but their defense is vulnerable, and Belichick knows this team too well to lose to them in the playoffs.</p><p>The Titans are the exciting team in the South; they come off a fringe-playoff season and head into 2017 with a second-place schedule with a young improving quarterback, Marcus Mariota, and a proven running back, DeMarco Murray. Still, this team isn’t developed enough to challenge the Patriots in crunch time.</p><p>Next, we move on to the Raiders in the West (the Chiefs are too conservative, the Chargers are old/hurt, the Broncos are closer to top five pick than a division title), who could have challenged New England last year had quarterback Derek Carr not suffered a season-ending injury before the playoffs. With Marshawn Lynch out of retirement to go to Oakland’s backfield, things are looking up for them.</p><p>With the Colts hampered, the Ravens and Bengals hampered, and a transitioning Broncos offense, the Chiefs should be able to sneak into the playoffs in a Wild Card spot, but they aren’t a real threat to the Patriots.</p><p>In the NFC, the Giants and Cowboys each make a strong case for the top spot in the East. The Giants added some firepower with wide receiver Brandon Marshall, making the trip from the other locker room to join the successful team in New Meadows. Dallas’s young star quarterback, Dak Prescott, has a year more of experience, but the loss of cornerback Brandon Carr and safety Barry Church will hamper their secondary, making it tough for them to repeat their 2016 success. The Giants have the edge in this division.</p><p>Speaking of the Packers, they didn’t get much better. They probably will barely use tight end Martellus Bennett, who they added this offseason, and their defense is still a bit of a mess. But they have arguably the most talented quarterback in history, Aaron Rodgers, so they’ll win their division and contend nonetheless.</p><p>In the South, the Falcons are coming off a surprise breakout season, but now they’ve lost offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, and they still lack defensive talent. The Panthers, on the other hand, drafted running back Christian McCaffrey out of Stanford, and they still possess one of the best defenses in the league, as well as former MVP quarterback Cam Newton. They won’t go 15-1 like they did in 2015, but a bounce back is in order and so is a Super Bowl hangover for Atlanta. Edge goes to Carolina.</p><p>The Seahawks will win the West, but it won’t be pretty behind an unstable offensive line and offensive weapons. The rest of this division is either old or terrible, so even with Seattle’s struggles, this appears to be a safe bet.</p><p>So now things look something like this:</p><p>AFC:</p><p>1. New England Patriots</p><p>2. Oakland Raiders</p><p>3. Pittsburgh Steelers</p><p>4. Tennessee Titans</p><p>5. Miami Dolphins</p><p>6. Kansas City Chiefs</p><p>NFC:</p><p>1. New York Giants</p><p>2. Green Bay Packers</p><p>3. Carolina Panthers</p><p>4. Seattle Seahawks</p><p>5. Dallas Cowboys</p><p>6. Atlanta Falcons</p><p>The Patriots are just better than every team in the AFC by a lot. They’re going to another Super Bowl.</p><p>The NFC will be much more interesting as the Giants are an unintimidating #1 seed, and the conference powerhouse Seahawks fizzle a bit to the #4 seed. The Seahawks versus the Cowboys should make for an interesting first round, but the Seahawks should prevail as the Cowboys lack a strong pass rush and have a very weak secondary, and the Seahawks haven’t lost a home playoff game in the Russell Wilson era (5-0). The Panthers and Falcons will feature no love lost as these two division foes go at it. Carolina should be able to win with home field advantage and a powerful defense that Atlanta will struggle against without Kyle Shanahan on the Falcons’s sideline.</p><p>From that point, I’ll pick against Eli Manning any day (he won’t become elite a third time), especially against a defense that will pressure him a lot and lock down his top targets. Seattle’s offensive line may be spotty, but the Giants’s lack of linebacker talent will allow Russell Wilson to scramble and dump down all day. On the other side of the NFC, Aaron Rodgers should catch fire as usual in the playoffs and blow past both the Panthers and Seahawks, as he’ll be playing in the comfy freezing temperatures of Lambeau Field.</p><p>Then, on to the Super Bowl!</p><p>Brady versus Rodgers is the marquee matchup of a lifetime, and this Super Bowl won’t disappoint. While Rodgers is the superior talent, at the end of the day, the superior roster and personnel will prevail as New England’s weapons on offense, playmakers on defense, and masterminds on the sideline will prove to be too much for Rodgers to carry the team any longer.</p><p>So, remember when I said we shouldn’t just write off everyone else and pick the repeat? This is one of those special cases. The last team to repeat was the Patriots back in the 2004 season, and now Brady and Belichick will do it again, earning their sixth ring and further cementing themselves as the best quarterback and coach of all time.</p><p>Full Predictions:</p><p>Wild Card Round</p><p>Steelers def. Chiefs</p><p>Titans def. Dolphins</p><p>Seahawks def. Cowboys</p><p>Panthers def. Falcons</p><p>Divisional Round</p><p>Patriots def. Titans</p><p>Steelers def. Raiders</p><p>Seahawks def. Giants</p><p>Packers def. Panthers</p><p>Conference Championship</p><p>Patriots def. Steelers</p><p>Packers def. Seahawks</p><p>Super Bowl</p><p>Patriots def.

878	My Encounter with the “Dark Side”  <p>The election of Donald Trump to the presidency has catapulted a number of figures with controversial opinions and affiliations into the national debate. None of these members of Trump’s political team is more controversial than Stephen Bannon. Bannon, a former naval officer and investment banker for Goldman Sachs, has, in recent years, been a prominent voice at the Breitbart news website. He has been accused of using his position as a platform to further the agenda of a group known as the Alt-Right, which aims at a restoration of white nationalism in the United States. There are striking similarities between this movement and the “Know Nothing” Party of the 1850s, with the important exception that the Know Nothings never won a general election.</p><p>Bannon left Breitbart late last summer to become an advisor to then-candidate Trump’s campaign. He has now been named as “chief strategist” for the incoming administration. Senator Harry Reid, among others, has prominently criticized this move, accusing Bannon of being “a champion of white supremacists.” It remains to be seen whether president-elect Trump will stick with his choice, or yield to the voices calling for Bannon’s removal from the inner circles of power. For his part, Bannon gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter on November 18 outlining his agenda and political philosophy. His emphasis in the interview was on a robust economic nationalism, not race: ”Like [Andrew] Jackson's populism, we're going to build an entirely new political movement… It's everything related to jobs.” He insisted that his role was as the administration’s purveyor of “Darkness” (his choice of words) the person who would use uncertainty and fear like Darth Vader (his example) to push the administration’s agenda, and keep its opponents off balance. I have watched Bannon’s rise with great interest. I had never heard of him until early last summer, and even then knew very little.  Yet I had the experience of having spoken with Bannon directly.</p><p>Last June, when my new book, “Rendezvous with Death” was released, my publicist put together a promotional campaign. I gave interviews, wrote articles, and spoke at various venues. One of the interviews was with the radio station operated by Breitbart news. The only thing I had ever heard about Breitbart was earlier in the spring when a female reporter for the website claimed she had been physically accosted by Donald Trump’s then-campaign manager at an event in Florida. My publicist said that it would be a great opportunity to reach millions of potential readers at what she characterized as a conservative counterpart of The Huffington Post. The interview itself was pretty ordinary. Bannon demonstrated some knowledge of history (which, in my experience, journalists are not often very informed about) and had claimed that he had read both my new book, and my first book on the War of 1812. He didn’t ask me any questions regarding contemporary politics or race relations, and I had no reason to anticipate that he would do so. Basically, I just talked about the book:  a story of a small group of Americans who joined the French Army in 1914 to fight the Kaiser’s invading army, and in so doing helped defend France and civilization itself, in their view. The summer rolled on, and I watched with alarm as Donald Trump was nominated by the Republican Party as its candidate for president. Then, in August, I read about Stephen Bannon joining Trump’s campaign, and his connections to the Alt-Right. This movement’s racist positions were disturbing. It seemed strange that the person I had spoken with could support these types of views. He seemed so <i>ordinary</i>. I recalled how he had claimed to have read my books, and this also struck a discordant note.</p><p>Both of the books that I have written include passages that are very critical of America’s historical record on race. They also both emphasize the heroic contributions of African Americans during the yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia in 1793, in the ultimately-doomed defense of Washington against the British in 1814, in the fight against Germany in the trenches, and in the skies over France, in 1914-1918. One of the main figures in my new book is the light heavyweight boxer, Bob Scanlon, of Mobile, Alabama, who became a close friend of poet Alan Seeger. He had made his way to Paris at a time when being black in America meant always having to live with the threat of mob violence just beneath the surface of American society. France, and Paris specifically, had given so much to Scanlon. He enlisted in the Foreign Legion in August, 1914, to repay this debt. Furthermore, the title of the fifth chapter in “Rendezvous with Death” is written in Arabic because it immortalizes a famous battle in Artois in 1915, in which the Americans fought side-by-side with Muslim soldiers from North Africa in a ferocious assault on Vimy Ridge. The Arabic printed on the chapter heading translates as “No Fear, No Pity”: the unit’s motto.  I wondered how Bannon could be the rabid racist he was being depicted as in the national media if he had, in fact, read my books and genuinely enjoyed them as much as he seemed. These two things just did not go together.</p><p>Perhaps he didn’t ever read my books. It’s been the rare journalist that I’ve encountered as an author, who has actually read one of my books. His enthusiasm might simply have been a courtesy to my publisher. Regnery History is, for the most part, a mainstream popular history list (it currently has a New York Times bestseller in a book called “Sgt. Reckless,” a true story about America’s version of “War Horse”). However, its parent company, Regnery publishing, is a conservative press that publishes more polemical books. I first became aware of Regnery History when it published Ronald Utt’s War of 1812 book, “Ships of Oak, Guns of Iron.” For a book on what is a relatively obscure topic for most readers, it did quite well. I thought the edition that they had come out with was very handsome. As an author of what was, frankly, a competitor book, “Knights of the Sea,” I have to admit I was a little jealous. When my agent received an offer from Regnery History for “Rendezvous,” and was able to get them to come up a bit, I took it. Reflecting back on the interview now, I think the possibility certainly exists that Bannon incorrectly assumed that I was a conservative author because Regnery publishing is the parent company of Regnery History. In fact, my publisher submitted my book to the Conservative Book Club hoping to reach a wider audience. From a marketing perspective this made some sense, since my new book is one that could appeal to both liberal and conservative readers. It deals with the polarizing topic of U.S. intervention in World War I (particularly as it related to the Seeger brothers, Charles and Alan), but it does not deal with any contemporary issues that polarize our country. Though I see nothing wrong with having a conservative political philosophy, my own politics lean more toward the center-left. In fact, on education and labor they are decidedly far left. So it is fair to say that Mr. Bannon made an incorrect assumption. And yet, I wonder.</p><p>One of the things that is abundantly clear in the Hollywood Reporter interview is how well-versed in history Stephen Bannon is. He has more than just a passing interest in it. How someone who is accused of spreading such vile views could endorse books with black and Muslim heroes is a riddle to me. I never met Bannon face to face, we conducted the interview on the phone, but I would be lying if I now claimed he was some sort of ogre. He wasn’t. He was a gracious and enthusiastic host. We want our villains to be sinister all the time, but the reality is they can be knowledgeable, even charming. I must say, I found his final comments in the interview that he gave very interesting indeed. In trying to explain how he envisioned his role in a Trump administration, he said he would be like “Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.” As NPR’s Kai Ryssdal remarked, it’s certainly worth noting that Cromwell, Henry VIII’s political “hatchet man” was executed once he’d exhausted his usefulness to the king.</p>	Article	276	2017-12-08 02:26:15.354694	2017-12-08 02:26:15.354694
986	﻿Featuring the New Electives Covering the new and interesting elective options that are being offered for the 2017-2018 autumn and spring semesters. <p>Filming the world through the perspective of a moving bicycle; learning the secrets of the IC, CIA, and NSA; transcribing music from one instrument onto the guitar. At Stuy, there is an elective for almost anything you can think of. This year, new electives have been created, and each one of them is bound to fill students with a sense of newfound appreciation.</p><p><h4>The Physics of Video Production</h4></p><p>Informally, The Physics of Video Production class is also known as “Introduction To Screen Studies.” Though it is taught by physics teacher Thomas Miner, the class does not revolve entirely around physics. Rather, it studies how physics is a part of film history and film theory, delving into everything from the smartphones of the present to the cinema screens of the past.</p><p>At first glance, it may seem odd that a physics teacher would create a class about film, as physics and film seem unrelated. For Miner, however, this interest in film isn’t random. In college, he also majored in Film Studies. After he accepted a teaching position at Stuyvesant, Miner jumped at the opportunity to teach a class that was oriented toward his passion for film.</p><p>Students view film material—from short films to animations, and everything in between—and then create film projects of their own. “I want students to become better practitioners of creating content. I think everyone is in charge of writing and producing [his or her] own films; essentially, if you think about Snapchat, or Instagram, or any kind of social media, we’re all basically the stars of our own films,” Miner explained.</p><p>In order to discover what aspects of film theory everyday observations reveal, the class often has group discussions. “We were talking about how the camera sees differently, how it has this alien perspective on us, on the world, and how his camera could see the world spinning,” Miner said. “A student had a film where he attached his phone to a bicycle wheel and it was just a beautiful whirlwind of colors and shapes.”</p><p>Miner’s passion for film helps students understand the importance of the moving image and encourages them to think outside the box. “This idea of assembling images that create meaning in the mind of the viewer—the essence of cinema is this montage of two images together. The collision of these two images creates an idea in the head of the viewer; that idea in and of itself is cinema,” Miner said.</p><p><h4>History of Intelligence</h4></p><p>After taking parental leave, Kerry Trainor has returned to Stuyvesant to teach his History of Intelligence elective during the spring semester. “I believe that, whenever possible, teachers should strive to teach content they are passionate about. I have always been fascinated and interested in the history of intelligence,” said Trainor in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Trainor wrote his Master Thesis on Congressional Oversight of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). It was while researching his thesis that Trainor noticed the number of college-level courses on the US Intelligence Community (IC) and later the lack thereof at Stuyvesant. This inspired him to create this elective. “I worked with several historians of Intelligence and Security Studies who helped me put it together. I then went through the process of getting it approved and was honored when our administration gave me the green light on it. I am very grateful to [Assistant Principal of Social Studies Jennifer] Suri, [former Principal Jie] Zhang, and the rest of the Cabinet,” Trainor said.</p><p>The curriculum Trainor designed covers the history behind the IC with a focus on the CIA , FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation), and the NSA (National Security Agency). In addition to their history, the class will also analyze how these spy agencies work and exactly what this work entails. Regarding what his students will take away from his elective, Trainor said, “Students will come away [with] a nuanced understanding of the role of largely secret intelligence agencies in an open democracy.”</p><p>The implications of the world of intelligence are vast: intelligence agencies are integral to foreign policy and the business world. As for whether this class will be continued in the future, as long as there is student demand, Trainor plans on teaching it.</p><p><h4>Guitar Appreciation</h4></p><p>The Music Department is offering a new class that teaches the same curriculum of the required Music Appreciation course, except with an intensive guitar unit. Guitar Appreciation is taught exclusively by music teacher Harold Stephan, who created the class when he needed to teach one of music teacher Liliya Shamazov’s classes, so she could teach another chorus period. He explained, “We thought it would be a great opportunity. It would be nice to offer something different.”</p><p>Stephan has experience teaching students how to play the guitar. “I taught one year of middle school, my first year teaching, where I had a guitar class already going. So it’s something that I felt comfortable doing,” he said. Stephan’s connection to the organization Little Kids Rock allowed him to get a grant for 50 free guitars. “Once I had that piece in place, it was a no-brainer to go ahead with it and create the curriculum to go along with it.”</p><p>The curriculum focuses on specific music pieces already taught in the Music Appreciation course, such as Ode to Joy and Pachelbel's Canon, that could be transposed to a guitar key. “They'll play along and hopefully remember it in a way that they wouldn’t necessarily remember it by sitting in a lecture type class,” he said.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not they play guitar, students can apply for the class or be randomly selected. He explained how he was surprised by the positive feedback the class received and the collaborative efforts of the students. “One of the nice things is that the kids who play guitar help the kids who don't play guitar to try to get everybody up to speed faster. Actually, I've been impressed by how fast the students have learned to play the basic chord shapes and strum along,” he said.</p><p>“The first time that I counted ‘1, 2, 3, C chord,’ everybody played the chord. It sounded like an ensemble C chord. Even if it wasn’t a piece a music, it was part of a piece of music,” he said, recalling his favorite moment of the year. “To me, that was the most gratifying thing, just to be able to hear kids who never played before to be able to participate and feel like they’re part of an ensemble.”</p><p>Because of his experience in the music industry, he is passionate about implementing more new classes in Stuyvesant. He is currently working on getting a grant for 30 electronic music workstations for a music production class. “I would like Stuyvesant to be the epicenter of songwriting and production at high levels in a high school environment in NYC, and possibly beyond,” Stephan said. In addition, he contacted the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences to start a summer camp program for Stuyvesant students. “I'd really love to be able to teach electronic music production, contemporary songwriting, classes like that,” he said</p><p><br/>Whether your love for learning lies in the arts, the humanities, the sciences, or something completely different, electives give us insight into topics that intrigue those who take them. Maybe you could find yourself in one of these specific elective classrooms in the future.</p>	Article	384	2018-01-23 02:17:54.03952	2018-01-23 02:17:54.03952
1020	﻿The Peglegs Looking to Make Comeback After a hard loss to Millennium High School, the Peglegs are looking to bounce back with a win against Tottenville High School. <p>With an aggressive return,  junior and co-captain Allison Eng ended her third round against her opponent from Tottenville High School. It was the girls’ varsity table tennis team’s first match since losing to Millennium High School.</p><p>The Peglegs ended up winning 4-1 against Tottenville High School in spite of a loss during first doubles. In singles matches, all three starters, junior and co-captain Katherine Lee, Eng, and sophomore Kasey Chan, had a rocky start, maintaining a marginal lead in their first respective games. However, in the following rounds after they’d warmed up, it became clear that nerves were responsible for their initial slip up. Instead of leading by only four points, it was by up to eight points for all three players. Lee, Eng, and Chan all won decisively, three games to none. In doubles, despite the Peglegs’ best efforts, they lost one out of their two matches, partly due to the fact that one of their starters was absent that day. “Some matches were a breeze but parts of our team need to do better in terms of giving away less points due to simple mistakes,” Eng said.</p><p>The team was recovering from a loss before winter break to Millennium High School, the current reigning champion of the Division I League. It was their second time being beat 5-0, so team spirit was at an all-time low. Their record after their game against Tottenville is 8-2, and they are currently second place in their League.</p><p>A player’s attitude and mindset going into a game is often the determining factor when the teams are evenly matched and just as important even if they aren’t. Coach Eric Wisotsky believes that the reason for their defeat stems from a lack of self-confidence and team morale. “The girls tend to get nervous even though they’re good enough to beat them. Skill-wise, they’re at the same level,” Wisotsky said. A look at game statistics of the Peglegs and Millennium match shows that the teams were fairly on par with each other with Eng losing 3-2 and a doubles duo of freshman Alyssa Yoo and Divya Chanani also losing 3-2.</p><p>Other than Millennium, no team so far this season has been able to seriously contend with the Peglegs for a spot in playoffs. “We still hope to make it far into the season into semifinals, and hopefully top 4, like last year. [It] hasn’t been as bad as we thought it would be without the seniors,” Eng said. The captains have worked hard thus far to maintain a similar record to that of last year’s despite the enormous gap the seniors of last year have left.</p><p>The team is looking to build themselves up again, so that even if they aren’t victorious this season, they will be next year. With the amount of sheer potential in the majority underclassmen and continuous drilling, the Peglegs hope to become an even more formidable force in PSAL and restore their title as champions. Especially now that the players have access to more newly purchased tables, bought in order for Stuyvesant to host the City Championships, they’ll be able to practice more. “While we might not beat Millennium this year because it requires multiple team members getting better in little time, our team [still] has years to improve,” Eng said.</p>	Article	418	2018-01-23 02:59:53.180375	2018-01-23 02:59:53.180375

The policy, effective immediately, will be strictly enforced through the use of a special student-led task force assembled by the Student Leadership Team (SLT) at this past month's meeting. Any violators will be put in the new pillory in front of the senior bar, subject to the taunting daps of passersby.</p><p>The ban, which applies to the half floor, library, and anywhere within four feet of senior and Spectator editor Shameek Rakshit, seeks to decrease the toxic behavior within the confines of the building. “I cannot condone the excessive amounts of friendliness going around in Stuyvesant’s halls,” nurse Danielle Karunadasa said.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, a dap “is a friendly gesture of greeting, agreement, or solidarity between two people,” with origins in the 1960s as a part of the Black Power movement. It has since turned into a barricade for students who run along the left side of escalators.</p><p>The new policy has some people worried about the direction the school is headed, including senior Datian Zhang, who regularly daps every teacher in the Physics department and has started a petition to reverse the change.</p><p>However, others have gladly showed their support for the decision. “I’m glad the school is letting us take action against this,” said senior and leader of the new SLT task force Anish Shenoy. “Just yesterday, I was talking to someone and they tried to dap me after I said something funny, and I was like ‘didn’t we just do this five minutes ago?’”</p>	Article	111	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
754	﻿Peglegs’ Tough Season Continues With Blowout Loss After a 0-6 start, the Stuyvesant Peglegs have tough matchups ahead in the team’s final three games. <p>“The whole Bayside game gave us some optimism for our Beach Channel game. We never gave up and really came together as a unit.” —Perry Wang, senior and captain</p><p>When a team starts a season with four consecutive losses, optimism can be hard to come by. However, for senior running back and captain of the Stuyvesant Peglegs varsity football team Perry Wang, there was still an upside to the team’s 55-12 loss to Bayside High School.</p><p>Though the Peglegs struggled, Wang is sure that they remained mentally tough. “The whole Bayside game gave us some optimism for our Beach Channel game. We never gave up and really came together as a unit,” he said.</p><p>As improbable as this may seem, considering that the blowout loss dropped the Peglegs to a 0-4 start for a second consecutive season, the team’s performance actually reflected Wang’s sentiment: They improved as the game progressed.</p><p>After being outscored 35-0 in the first half—the third time this season that the Peglegs have been shut out in the first two quarters—the team fought back, adding two passing touchdowns and holding Bayside scoreless in the third quarter.</p><p>Furthermore, the Peglegs stayed true to their strength, which, according to Wang, is their passing game. Aside from an interception, senior quarterback Rigneyla Rigneyla was spectacular, completing 10 of 13 passes for two touchdowns as Stuyvesant outgained Bayside in the passing game with 175 yards to Bayside’s 102.</p><p>With the following week’s opponent, Beach Channel Educational Campus, having posted a high of just 63 yards through the first four games, Rigneyla’s aerial prowess had the potential to pose a serious advantage. This game, on October 8, resulted in another Peglegs loss, but proved that Wang’s confidence was not unfounded. They only lost by 10 points, the narrowest of any game thus far this season.</p><p>They have also showed a significant defensive improvement. After giving up 127 total points over the previous three weeks, the Peglegs held Beach Channel to just 16 and shut them out through three of the four quarters. This is especially impressive considering that Rigneyla threw two interceptions in this game, meaning that Beach Channel started their drives with good field position on multiple occasions.</p><p>Of course, the Peglegs had their fair share of struggles, too. For one, Rigneyla was not as sharp as he had normally been. Completing just seven of 25 passes for just 75 yards, a touchdown, and the two interceptions, it marked the first time this season that Rigneyla turned the ball over twice and also failed to complete even half of his passes.</p><p>Additionally, Rigneyla’s completion percentage in this game (28 percent) was his lowest of the first five games. This is not to put all the blame on the quarterback, though: the Peglegs came up short in many other areas. For example, though Stuyvesant contained Beach Channel’s passing game well, giving up just four completions for 38 yards, the Peglegs were not nearly as dominant against the run. Both of the touchdowns that Beach Channel scored came on the ground, and the Peglegs gave up over 100 rushing yards for the fifth consecutive game.</p><p>This speaks to their lack of size in the defensive line, something that Wang described as being one of Stuyvesant’s weaknesses before the season. “We might not physically match up against every team,” he said.</p><p>This is not to say that Peglegs have regressed defensively. In fact, many of the team’s defensive newcomers—namely Joshel Xiedeng, Ian Sulley, and Daniel Chernov—are playing well. Against Beach Channel, these three defensive linemen combined for a total of 10 tackles, two tackles for a loss, and a sack, with Wang himself also adding a sack of his own from the linebacker position.</p><p>However, it just isn’t enough against teams with larger offensive linemen. This was the case last season too when the Peglegs gave up 196 rushing yards to a more sizeable George Washington team en route to a 36-20 loss, and it was likely also the case against Beach Channel.</p><p>The Peglegs’ most recent game, however—aptly played on Friday, October 13—featured far fewer potential positive takeaways from a glance. In a 54-14 loss to Eagle Academy, Stuyvesant’s play was diametrically opposed to what one would have expected after the stout defensive performance against Beach Channel.</p><p>Though the Peglegs again demonstrated an ability to finish strong, scoring the entirety of their 14 points in the second half, it was a dismal game overall, particularly on defense. They were dominated in the run game, giving up 358 rushing yards, including 235 on 13 carries by Eagle Academy’s Gary Newman. On top of that, the Peglegs gave up their highest passing total of the season, 85 yards.</p><p>There does not seem to be just one thing for the Peglegs to do in order to turn their season around. Rather, it will take improvements in all facets of their game for them to get a win in their remaining games. However, in a division as difficult as theirs, if they keep the positive attitude Wang and others have shown thus far, the future looks good for the team.</p>	Article	116	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

The team needed to win two of the last three games to make the playoffs and did so.The team also beat its rival, Lab Museum United, 4-3 in overtime two days prior to the LaGuardia game.</p><p>The win against Lab Museum United was not only crucial for the playoffs, but was also payback because the Mimbas had lost to them 3-2 in overtime earlier this season. The second game did not start well for them, falling behind 3-1 early. However, once the second half started, they quickly scored two goals, tying the game. When they entered overtime, Lab Museum United picked up the physicality, and in the last 30 seconds, the refs called a direct free kick, which sophomore Selene Kaehny drilled into the goal. “When my shot went right over the keeper's head I was in shock. [I’m] not going to lie: I started crying a little bit because the entire team ran over to me and started hugging and screaming,” she said.</p><p>The wins against Lab Museum United and LaGuardia High School showcased the Mimbas strength of the underclassmen on the team, since they scored seven of the eight goals during this two game stretch. Kaehny scored three, sophomore Eve Wening scored two, and freshman Aki Yamaguchi scored two. Furthermore, sophomore goalie Emory Walsh has stepped up and been a tremendous player for the team, saving 26 shots over the past two games.</p><p>The Mimbas had many cancelled games due to weather, and they used that time wisely. “We stayed really focused during the time that we had off and just kept practicing really hard,” senior and co-captain Saloni Majmudar said. They also used this time to bond and become more close-knit than before. “We use this time not only to become better soccer players, but [to become] better teammates because individuals don’t win games, teams do,” senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl said.</p><p>The Mimbas are excited and ready for the playoffs, and they could not be coming at a better time. Since September 19, the team has gone 5-1 and hopes to continue the hot streak into the playoffs. Last year, the team finished with a similar record and lost in the first round in the playoffs, but the team believes it can go further than it has before. “[In] the past two games, our skill level as a team has just skyrocketed. I’ve never seen us play like this before.” Kaehny said.</p>	Article	120	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
756	﻿The Vixen Vex in First Home Game The Vixens have previously had a very successful run in their Manhattan A Division in the past, and lived up to their expectations in the first home game of their season against Bard High School of Early College. <p>The atmosphere of the crowded third floor gym surged as junior Alexandra Archer approached for a middle hit. She slammed the ball down mercilessly, refusing to ease up despite the otherwise relaxed game between Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity volleyball team and Bard High School of Early College’s volleyball team. The other players had a similar mindset, making few, if any, errors throughout the game and taking advantage of every free ball over and every opportunity for a hit or a bump.</p><p>“There wasn’t too much I could evaluate them on, other than maybe serving and a few free passes, which they did well,” coach Vasken Choubaralian said. Indeed, key players like senior, co-captain, and outside hitter Ziqi Guo, senior and opposite hitter Zilin Guo, and senior, co-captain, and libero Kristina Kim had serving streaks of nine, seven, and seven, respectively. The scores were devastating for the other team, with the Vixens dominating 25-6 and 25-10.</p><p>The team this year is mostly unchanged because most of the starting players last year are seniors this year. However, a notable exception is freshman and middle hitter Anaïs Delfau, whose sister was last year’s captain Chloe Delfau.</p><p>Both Ziqi Guo and Choubaralian believe that the team’s chemistry this year is stronger. “The traditional view of a varsity team is that the seniors or juniors get to start because of experience. However, our starting freshman has the same, if not more, experience than some of the current juniors or seniors. In the end, coach tries to put the best lineup out there regardless of your grade,” Ziqi Guo said. Coach Chourbaralian and Assistant Coach Pan have demonstrated this mentality in their experimentation and flexibility with the lineup, allowing many of the more inexperienced players to come in as substitutes when the Vixens had a strong lead.</p><p>A straight two-set win for the Vixens’ first home game speaks to a promising season for them, and if last year was anything of an indication, they’re a strong prospect for playoffs, as well as the top teamof the Manhattan A League.</p><p>However, in the past, once the Vixens defeated schools in Manhattan in the playoffs, they struggled and had to end their season disappointingly early. Ziqi hopes that additional scrimmages, the heightened team bond, and the practice in improving passing will remedy this issue. “I see a lot of potential in our team, and as long as we play together like a team, we will be able to play our best every game,” she said.</p><p>“[Being PSAL Champions] will probably be a distant goal of mine. A more realistic goal would be semifinals, at least,” Choubaralian said. “We still need to work on backrow passing, service reception, and improving my setter a little bit. [With that], I think we’ll be quite unstoppable.”</p>	Article	113	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

758	﻿Is DeShone Kizer Due to Be Another Cleveland Bust? Despite a rocky statistical start, DeShone Kizer still has a chance to be successful if the support around him improves. <p>JR: Hey Meech, were you planning on adding anything about how Kizer got benched for a game? Other than that this is a super interesting article and there is just some minor grammatical stuff.</p><p>Every time the Cleveland Browns start a new quarterback, it seems to cause waves of overwhelming euphoria, followed quickly by crippling disappointment. Since being reintroduced to the National Football League (NFL) in 1999, the Browns have not found an answer at the position. From Tim Couch and Brady Quinn to college standout Johnny Manziel and Washington castoff Robert Griffin III, when it comes to quarterbacks, nothing has worked for the Browns.</p><p>Through four games so far, this season looks to have been much of the same. With bottom-of-the-barrel totals in completion percentage (52 percent), passer rating (47.8), and touchdown-to-interception (TD:INT) ratio (3:11), rookie DeShone Kizer looks the part of another Cleveland bust.</p><p>To make matters worse, fellow rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson, whom the Browns had an opportunity to draft, has gone on a tear over his last four starts for the Houston Texans, leading all quarterbacks in rushing yards per game while going 3-2 as a starter (as opposed to 0-6 in Kizer’s case).</p><p>Furthermore, while Watson’s position as the Texans’ starter has gone unquestioned since he took over, Kizer’s grip on the Browns’ starting job seems to be coated in Vaseline. Over the course of the Browns’ 0-7 start, Kizer has been benched numerous times and for two different backup quarterbacks.</p><p>Against the New York Jets, Kizer was pulled at the start of the second half for Kevin Hogan in a desperate, vain attempt to escape with a close win. Then, after the Browns lost that game, 17-14, Hogan was given the start the following week in a loss to the Texans. After Hogan’s three-interception debacle, Kizer was given the start against the Tennessee Titans, but was again pulled just after halftime after throwing two revolting interceptions, this time for Cody Kessler. With Kessler now expected to start next week against the Vikings, 2017 looks like another lost season of ghastly quarterback plays for the Browns.</p><p>However, considering that the supporting cast that Kizer has to work with is subpar and that the Browns’ head coach, Hue Jackson, has been quite austere with young quarterbacks in the past, the outlook for Kizer and the Browns may not be as grim as it seems.</p><p>Kizer has fallen victim to two key factors: inadequate support from his wide receivers and an overzealous head coach. The first of these has not only been the most obvious but also the most egregious.</p><p>The Browns have been plagued with underperforming wide receivers all year, with no worse offender than this offseason’s marquee free agent pickup, Kenny Britt. Last season, Britt experienced a breakout for the Los Angeles Rams despite putrid quarterback play from Case Keenum and Jared Goff.</p><p>Britt eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career and showcased a consistent ability to get open for first downs, stay balanced, and make plays after the catch. This led to a four-year, $32.5 million contract from the Browns and an expectation that Britt would be not only a reliable target, but also a veteran mentor for youngsters Corey Coleman, Ricardo Louis, and Kasen Williams. So far, however, Britt has been all but that.</p><p>Britt’s hands and route-running have been inconsistent all season, but they were especially poor Week 4 against the Cincinnati Bengals. To put it bluntly, Britt cost the Browns two separate drives. Early in the first quarter, with the Browns on the Bengals’ 30-yard line and the potential to capitalize on a fumble by quarterback Andy Dalton, Britt had a prime opportunity to convert a long third down on a comeback route.</p><p>Though Kizer’s pass was slightly short, it was still certainly catchable, but Britt let it through his paws, forcing the Browns to settle for (and miss) a long field goal attempt. Later, in the second quarter, with the Browns within 20 yards of Cincinnati’s end zone, Kizer hit Britt squarely in the chest, but Britt allowed it to ricochet off and up for an easy interception, putting another demoralizing end to a potential touchdown drive.</p><p>Of course, not all of the blame can be put on Britt. Other members of the receiving corps—running back Isaiah Crowell, for example—dropped their own fair share of passes, and, more importantly, Kizer’s own flaws cannot be ignored. There is much to like about Kizer: he has a hefty throwing arm, his so-called “football intelligence” is extremely high, and he is adept at avoiding pressure from pass rushers and fluidly reestablishing his throwing mechanics on the move. However, he has one notable deficiency: his accuracy. Simply put, Kizer’s ball placement is poor to all levels of the field. While he can somewhat make up for it with his arm strength, it becomes an issue when so many of his passes are slightly off the mark.</p><p>This is especially problematic for the Browns. Wide receivers, after all, are not machines. They will catch most passes thrown to them, but will also naturally drop a fair share. With an inaccurate quarterback like Kizer, the drop rate will only go up since the receivers do not know where to expect the ball and then are forced to contort their bodies like the artistes of Cirque du Soleil to even attempt a catch. With a receiving corps as young as Cleveland’s, this is exacerbated by poor technique and a lack of football instincts. Hence, Kizer and his receivers only make each other look worse than they truly are.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Browns’ head coach and offensive coordinator Jackson has insisted on emphasizing an offensive scheme that plays away from the strengths of his receiving corps, which has only further exposed Kizer’s struggles. Seeing Kizer’s arm strength, patience against pressure, and ability to use fakes to manipulate defenders downfield, Jackson established a deep passing-heavy offensive scheme.</p><p>The problem with this approach is that the Browns’ wide receivers, running backs, and tight ends are not conducive to such an offense, especially with Corey Coleman, the Browns’ most explosive option, out with an injury. Britt is simply not fast enough to be a threat downfield, and Ricardo Louis and Kasen Williams, while supremely athletic, are too raw to actually gain consistent separation and are still unrefined in terms of seeing and tracking the ball and securing catches.</p><p>Furthermore, Jackson has almost completely abandoned the running game, despite having two capable running backs in Duke Johnson Jr. and Isaiah Crowell to work with. Crowell, supposedly the Browns’ lead running back, has averaged just 13 carries a game this season, a far cry from the typical workload of a feature back (Jordan Howard of the Chicago Bears, for instance), which normally hovers around 20 touches a game. Johnson, meanwhile, has gone full games without running the ball.</p><p>This is unfortunate to see since the Browns’ offense is young and has the potential to be one to feel excited about. However, for the Browns’ offense and Kizer to be successful, there must be two drastic measures taken. First, the Browns need to become more devoted to the run. Crowell is a gritty, powerful runner that enjoyed his first 1,000-yard season a year ago and is more than capable of carrying the Browns’ torch. Johnson, meanwhile, is a quicker option with receiving abilities to boot and can serve as a perfect complement. If the Browns had established the run against teams with weak linebackers, such as the Indianapolis Colts in Week 3, they could have had at least one win.</p><p>The next move would be to focus more on intermediate passing and play-action fakes. Play-action is when the quarterback fakes handing the ball to a running back, thereby drawing the defense out of position, and then proceeds to pass against a shifted, discombobulated defense. However, this can only happen with a strong run game; otherwise, defenders would not fall for the fake. With play-action implemented, the Browns could then integrate players like Britt, who thrives on intermediate curls and crossing routes, and big tight ends, like David Njoku and Seth DeValve, into a timing-based, quick-hitting offense that allows Kizer to use his strong arm to hit tight windows.</p><p>If that happens, then the horrid statistics that Kizer has put up week to week should begin to level off. As bad as Kizer has been, he has not been as bad as his 3:11 TD:INT ratio may indicate. In the modern NFL, such a figure is almost unheard of: the only quarterback last season to play in all 16 games and finish with more interceptions than touchdowns was Brock Osweiler, who was actually cut by the Browns this preseason.</p><p>If the problems in Kizer’s surrounding personnel can be mitigated, he should finally start to look like an acceptable NFL quarterback. From there, his future would depend on his growth. Kizer’s skill set is similar to that of Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who has built a Hall of Fame career out of extending plays and throwing deep. If Kizer improves his ball placement, allowing his receivers a better chance at the ball, we could see much of the same. However, if he stays inconsistent, he will remain in the doldrums of mediocrity.</p>	Article	114	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
759	﻿Boys Badminton Look Forward to Post-Season The boys’ badminton team has a mini three game winning streak and hopes to keep it up. Feeling good about themselves in recent games, the team has high morale. <p>With a 5-0 win over Martin Luther King Jr. High School (MLK), Stuyvesant’s boys’ badminton team continued its dominant three game stretch. The team won a combined 10-0 in the previous two games against High School of Fashion Industries and Dr. Susan S. Mckinney School of Art.</p><p>Led by a strong senior class, the team has been lights-out this season, currently second in its division at 7-2 behind Brooklyn Technical High School, who is at 9-0. The entire starting lineup, except for the second doubles team, is made up of seniors who have been on the team for at least a year and already know the drill. They understand the game and have learned the right mindset in order to be successful.</p><p>“[We] initially just try to go out there and do our best to win both doubles and win in the singles matches,” senior Alexander Lu said. By taking each game match by match, the team doesn’t get caught up in the overall picture and only focuses on each moment individually. This mindset allows the players to exert all their energy on the current play and to not worry about past matches.</p><p>On the sidelines before the MLK match, senior and captain Steve Wong stood firm and tall, using his racquet to practice his stroke. This purpose was twofold: to make sure he was ready for the game and also to gain a competitive edge by scaring his opponents. “Many of the opposing players were inexperienced and [...] I tried instilling a sense of uneasiness into those inexperienced players by showing them how aggressive and prepared I was,” Wong said.</p><p>Stepping into his doubles match against MLK with Lu, Wong winded up his racquet, ricocheting the shuttlecock over the net as the opposing players failed to answer. Evidently, this scare tactic worked, as he and Lu won their first set 21-0 and came out victorious in the remaining sets, gaining a point for Stuyvesant.</p><p>Coach Marvin Autry believes the experience of the seniors has played a big role in the team’s success. “Our starters know where they stand and are focused and poised because they know themselves better than anyone else,” Autry said. Most of the players independently prepare on the side before their actual match and at practice to understand what they need to improve upon or know what skills they have confidence in.</p><p>This team believes it can succeed this post-season. The past three years have all led to second-round exits in the playoffs, so hopefully this can be the year the team breaks through.</p>	Article	117	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
879	Teacher’s Take: History: Worthy of Study On Its Own Merits  <p>I was a little hesitant at first after The Spectator asked me to write on a topic of my choosing. After all, I had just completed my first year teaching at Stuyvesant in June. Though my experience teaching here is as valid as anyone else’s, it is neither broad nor deep. In fact, it has primarily been confined to a slice of the building on the third and second floors, where I share an office space and teach my classes. So, instead of writing on Stuyvesant specifically, I felt I should write on something where I might enjoy greater credibility with students and colleagues: history. This will be my 18th year teaching history, and frankly, I can’t imagine doing anything else.</p><p>I love teaching history. One of my fondest memories is of fishing on the Maine coast with my grandfather while he told me about Hannibal and his army of elephants crossing the alps.* History holds the same fascination for me now as it did then. For me, the past has always been this distant, unreachable country that at the same time is strangely near. I suppose this is a result of us all being part of something larger than ourselves—the story of humanity—a continuum with all those that came before, and all who will follow. I must admit, however, that the future, in a broad sense, holds little interest for me. I’m an antiquarian. What use is this? i’ve often heard this question posed in one form or another, both as a student and as a teacher. That in order for history to justify its inclusion in the curriculum it needs to possess a utilitarian function. As if something couldn’t possibly have value if it didn’t have a practical application. When I cast my line into the water beside my grandfather as he introduced me to classical history all those years ago, this was the last thing on my mind. It was interesting, and that was enough.</p><p>Later, as a more serious student of history, I often heard the justification that those who ignore history are bound to repeat its errors. Initially, this thesis appeared sound. I didn’t question it. However, as I learned of its application in both the present and the past, I found it didn’t bear close scrutiny. As the greek philosopher Heraclitus once postulated, you can never step in the same river twice. Like a river, the continuum of the story of humanity is constantly changing. The variables are nearly endless. Alexander Kerensky’s decision to launch his July offensive in 1917, following the overthrow of the czar and the establishment of the provisional government, comes to mind. Like most of the Russian Revolution’s leading gures, Kerensky was a keen student of the French revolution. The lesson that he drew from it in this instance was that a free citizenry of a nascent democracy would be able to sweep the forces of autocracy by dint of sheer revolutionary enthusiasm, as had the French levée en masse at the Battle of Valmy in 1792. Later, after his most enthusiastic troops had been mowed down by German machine guns, the offensive sputtered out. Kerenesky was left with his authority and credibility permanently eroded, thus paving the way for his great rival, Lenin, to come to power. Kerensky knew his history, but he drew the wrong lessons from it. More recently, I recall quite well the learned opinions of those who confidently predicted the Iraq War would prove to be a repetition of the Vietnam War. To be sure, there were certain similarities between the two. But they were very different wars, motivated by very different lines of thinking, with different outcomes. Did George W. Bush draw lessons from Lyndon Johnson’s actions in an earlier decade? I don’t know. But even if he had—which lessons? Were they the correct ones? This is the problem with using history as some kind of tool. It can provide examples, inspire, and shed light on how others pursued certain courses of action, but it is not a failsafe predictor of future events (e.g. this policy will absolutely result in X because it did so in the past). Additionally, beware those ambitious minds that craft grand, unifying historical theses—Karl Marx comes to mind. In my opinion, his manifesto is brilliant (and prescient), but it conveniently ignores, or trammels over, the power that nationalism and religion wielded in his own times, and in our own. Again, there are too many variables for history to be reduced to a formula.</p><p>So, if not a tool, then what value is there in learning history? Well, there is the craft of history itself: the analysis of documents; acquiring familiarity with highly regarded secondary sources; an awareness of how the process of revision makes history a subject that is always becoming (i.e. not static); and writing effectively, and often persuasively. These types of exercises develop one’s intellect and cultivate critical thinking. There is little to criticize here. And yet, as much as I like to emphasize historiography (when possible) and writing, these, to me, are not the primary reasons why I believe history is important. Ultimately, it comes back to the story. A story that encompasses all of mankind’s various endeavors and hopes. Art, literature, diplomacy, finance, architecture, industry, science, philosophy, exploration, government, law, faith, war: all are part of this story. And we are part of it. The simple act of taking an interest in one’s surroundings (How was my neighborhood created? Why?) demonstrates a capacity for historical empathy and opens up the possibility of seeing the present in a fresh way. If nothing else, the ability to discern the difference between a Gothic and a Romanesque arch, or discuss Zola’s role in the Dreyfus affair, or examine the impact of the GI Bill on post-war American society makes one a more interesting person to spend time with, and makes one’s life simply more interesting as a whole. I think that, in this, history is a gift. iI binds us, brings vitality to life, and improves our minds. It’s a bit of a mix of Homer and Socrates. And that’s pretty good company to keep.</p><p><i>* There is lack of agreement among historians whether Hannibal was able to get his elephants across the alps alive to Italy.</i></p>	Article	277	2017-12-08 02:36:38.417471	2017-12-08 02:36:38.417471
760	﻿Birdies Look to Playoffs After Another Undefeated Season The Birdies have finished up another successful season and are now directing their attention to the playoffs <p>The Birdies, Stuyvesant’s varsity girls’ golf team, continued their undefeated streak after beating the Brooklyn Technical Engineers 5-0 on October 20. All five of the team’s starters shot well, outscoring the Engineers by 12 holes overall, with three of the team’s match victories coming at a margin of three holes or more.</p><p>The Birdies’ strong play landed them at the top of their division with an 8-0 record, three games ahead of James Madison High School. For the past four years, the team has succeeded in the Brooklyn A Division.</p><p>Last year, the Birdies performed similarly in the regular season, maintaining an undefeated season, but they failed to capitalize in the playoffs, losing to Staten Island Technical High School (2-3) in the second round. “We knew we definitely could have advanced to semifinals last year, so we were pretty disappointed,” sophomore Charlotte Yee said.</p><p>Though the playoff bracket is not completely set, the Birdies will likely have a bye in the first round of the playoffs, but they might face a familiar opponent in the second round.</p><p>In addition to the team playoffs, the top players in the PSAL are selected to compete in the individual competition. Last year, Stuyvesant sent four golfers to the individual championships, but they didn’t manage to chart on the top spots.</p><p>This year, senior Lucy Liu is the only one on the team attending the much smaller individual competition, and she will look to learn from her experience last year. However, winning in the individual competition will be tough due to strong competition from Hunter High School golfers.</p><p>The team has enjoyed this success because of coach Emilio Nieves. Golf is not as popular for students coming into Stuyvesant, so many of the players of the Birdies had to be taught the basics. “He really tried to diagnose what is wrong with my swing and helped me improve a lot,” Park said.</p>	Article	118	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
761	Peglegs Finishing Off a Strong Season Stuy’s boys varsity soccer team, continue their successes as their season comes to an end, earning a spot in the playoffs. <p>The Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity soccer team, have earned themselves a spot in the playoffs. Approaching the end of their season with just one game left, the Peglegs are looking to end strong. This is their most successful season in years, currently sitting in second place with 21 points, just behind their long time rival Martin Luther King Jr. High School (MLK), with 27 points.</p><p>They have been nearly unbeatable these past few months, with a record of seven wins and two losses in their PSAL Manhattan A1 division. “With an eighth win and an 8-2 finish, we are hoping for a high seed in the playoffs,” Coach Vincent Miller said.</p><p>Though the Peglegs have had a total of three postponed games this season, it has not stopped them from using each game as an opportunity to improve. “We've gotten better at being more aggressive and taking shots since the beginning of the season,” senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzberg said. This is reflected in the team's stats with the number of shots on goal in their most recent game doubling that of the number of shots in the match that started their season. Their shots peaked mid-season, reaching a total of 18 in one game against Washington Irving High School.</p><p>In their last game against Frederick Douglass Academy, the team showed resilience and a diversity of talent. At the end of the first half, the game was tied at two. This continued until the end of time, so the match went into overtime, a sudden death round. The Peglegs were able to finish off the game with a 3-2 win. This game showed the ability of many teammates to finish. Three goals were scored by three different people: juniors Jeffrey Shen and Robert Nava, along with sophomore Jeremy Moller. The development of these younger players have been crucial this year and will improve the team in the future.</p><p>As they continue to improve at both games and practice, the team reflects on how to do better. “Our strengths are definitely our defense and ability to counterattack. I think our possession has definitely improved. While it's not quite as much of a strength as I would like, we have shown the ability to dominate a game by possessing the ball,” senior and co-captain Michael Gillow said. Hopefully, the team can improve on their possession time.</p><p>As the playoffs approach, the Peglegs are looking to go as far as possible and, ideally, beat their main opponent, Martin Luther King Junior High School, if the opportunity arises. They have not lost hope despite their 4-0 loss in their first game against MLK, followed by a 5-0 loss to them later in the season. “We held MLK scoreless for 39 minutes, but [we] allowed them to score two in the final few minutes of the half. We have to remain focused and capitalize better on our chances. We also need to have a better response if MLK scores, so we don't let them get into a rhythm,” said Smith-Salzberg, referring to their second game.</p><p>It is clear that this team has the ability and skills to handle tougher teams such as MLK, but it is simply a matter of consistently playing hard. “I feel [that] if we play a third game against MLK, we will give them everything we have and play very hard to the final minute,” Coach Miller said.</p><p>Though the team will most likely not face MLK in the playoffs, they have high hopes that their improvement will produce positive results as they face new teams outside of their division for the first time. “The team has played with a great amount of grit and toughness [...] and an attitude that [they] can beat anyone in the city,” Miller said.</p><p>As the Peglegs finish up the final stretch of their season with numerous victories, it is clear that they can go far in the playoffs. They just need to become more focused and capitalize on the opportunities they get.</p>	Article	121	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
763	﻿A Clean Break For the 2017-2018 ARISTA EC “In the long run, we want ARISTA to serve the purpose of adding to and building up your character,” ARISTA President Nicholas Lee said. “That’s... <p>“In the long run, we want ARISTA to serve the purpose of adding to and building up your character,” ARISTA President Nicholas Lee said. “That’s one of the things we want to focus ARISTA into becoming: not just an organization for your college applications, but an organization that holds actual meaning.”</p><p>The 2017-2018 ARISTA Executive Council (EC) is comprised of juniors Nicholas Lee, Sophie Feng, Luola Chen, Ryan Sui, and Selina Zou. They will serve as ARISTA’s President, Executive Vice President, and Vice Presidents of Tutoring, Web Development, and Events, respectively.</p><p>Previously, ARISTA was a chapter of the National Honors Society (NHS), a nationwide organization of high school students who exemplify the four pillars of scholarship, character, leadership, and service.</p><p>However, seniors Evelyn Gotlieb, Julia Ingram, Rodda John, Giselle Garcia, and Sharon Chao, the former EC, determined that they would not renew Stuyvesant’s membership with the NHS, and went on to ratify ARISTA’s Bylaws on Thursday, June 1, in conjunction with Principal Eric Contreras and Faculty Advisor Jo Mahoney.</p><p>The EC had been unknowingly adhering to ARISTA Guidelines, which were created by an organization much like the NHS that was located in New York City during the 1980s until it went bankrupt.</p><p>“I brought to the attention of the EC back in January or February that we were not in compliance with the NHS Constitution, and I started writing our Bylaws at that point in time with the goal that we would break away at some point in the future,” John said. “The way I had originally written [the Bylaws] was that we would stay in the NHS, but would purposefully ignore the specific tenets that did not apply to us. [This] wasn’t necessarily the most legal thing to do under the NHS [Constitution], but it was what we had decided was best.”</p><p>“Most of the high schools in the city do not [follow the NHS Constitution], but due to a complicated situation, we are not renewing our membership to the NHS,” Feng said. “Contreras was supposed to read all of the applications, but you can’t really expect him to read 300 plus applications in a school of this size. It’s almost impossible.”</p><p>Though the EC declined to comment on the context surrounding this “complicated situation,” Lee asserted that this turn of events is a welcome change. “Stuy[vesant] is one of the most unique schools in New York City and nationwide, so I feel like it wouldn’t be the best for students to be  subject to [the NHS’s] general laws. Instead, we want to create a Stuyvesant Honors Society in which our programs and our Bylaws reflect more of our community,” he said.</p><p>Changing the dynamic within ARISTA is the EC’s primary goal.“We are all trying to take this approach to becoming more [relatable] and less separated from the normal members of ARISTA,” Chen said. “Many of us have proposed bonding events so ARISTA members feel like they are a part of this overarching organization. [The former EC had] awards to recognize the most dedicated members of ARISTA.”</p><p>To highlight the pillar of service, the EC plans to restructure the events requirements in order to encourage members to volunteer for a spectrum of events. “This year, members will hopefully work with a diverse set of organizations. While changes are not set in stone, we're hoping that somehow we'll be able to work [toward] this goal and foster a stronger spirit of volunteerism in ARISTA,” Zou said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>“We want to get new events into ARISTA that not only are more fun for the volunteers, but will also hopefully create a more meaningful experience on both ends: our volunteers and the people that receive the work that they do,” Lee said.</p><p>In fact, when asked to describe their most meaningful experience in ARISTA thus far, each member of the EC spoke of a time that accentuated the collaborative nature of the organization.“One of the best things about ARISTA is that you can create these long lasting connections with people inside and outside of school and from all different walks of life,” Chen said.</p><p>Chen is working to bolster the effectiveness of the Tutoring Committee and better encompass these values. She also recognized that historically, peer tutoring has been a requirement that members struggle with successfully completing, and in order to remedy this, she hopes to find more effective alternatives to one-on-one peer tutoring.</p><p>Her primary goal, however, is to implement a system within the already pre-existing anonymous pairing system on their website that assigns tutees to tutors based on the teacher. “It resolves a few issues that I have encountered this year while tutoring,” she said. “Many teachers often teach at different paces and emphasize different aspects of the curriculum, so it’s really hard to find a meeting ground where the tutor is able to offer the tutee what they need in a tutor. It also helps the tutor go into teaching at ease. They aren’t just trying their best, but are prepared.”</p><p>With this growing dependence on the ARISTA’s online presence, the Communications Committee was absolved this year and replaced with the Web Development Committee. “The roles of the Communications Committee tended to be [making] Facebook posts, [advertising] events, occasionally [making] posters, and [making] a promotional video,” John said. “We’ve been shifting toward using the websites to manage the organization, not only for ARISTA, but for the [Student Union’s] ID website, application website for Big Sibs, and the Parent Teacher Conference website. All of those functions were managed by me in conjunction with the Web Development Committee.”</p><p>Sui plans to build on the efforts of John by making their online interface more user-friendly. ”We want to change the fact that you have to make separate accounts for all of these different websites, so it’s easier to access,” he said. “Right now, we want to speed up the process of checking AIS sheets and essays.”</p><p>The EC hopes that their efforts will positively color the experiences of ARISTA members and emphasize the importance of the four pillars. “By making all these changes, we can give ARISTA the actual depth to become this meaningful high school experience that isn’t a chore for people, but a life changing experience that people can take something away from,” Lee said.</p>	Article	129	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
764	﻿Stuyvesant Goes National in National History Day Competition Stuyvesant participated in the National History Day (NHD) competition for the second year in a row and sent two teams to nationals <p>Stuyvesant participated in the National History Day (NHD) competition for the second year in a row. In the New York State division, junior Shameek Rakshit placed second in the individual website category with his project “B.R. Ambedkar: Framing an Egalitarian India.” In the group website category, juniors Kristin Lin, Samantha Ngo, and Jenny Gao placed third with their project “Love Canal’s Toxic Relationship: Citizens Fight for Their Health Against an Apathetic Government.” Rakshit, Ngo, Lin, and Gao all qualified for the national level competition and will be travelling to Maryland on June 13.</p><p>The NHD competition is an annual history competition available to students throughout the U.S. Participants research a topic related to a theme. This year students were asked to frame their projects around the theme “Taking A Stand in History.” Participants were able to present  the topic as either a website, exhibit board, theatrical performance, film, or original documentary.</p><p>History teachers Eric Wisotzky and Robert Sandler were in charge of mentoring the teams. “I helped the kids pick the topics. I helped them research those topics and recommended good historians, I helped them get interviews with historians actually in the field. I helped them with the aesthetics of their websites or the aesthetics of their poster boards,” Sandler said.</p><p>Every student in Wisotzky’s U.S. History and Sandler’s AP U.S. History classes were required to submit a project, while it was optional for other U.S. History classes. “I like the idea of students working together and improving to solve a problem, and the problem is to create some really cool, visually impressive, but also academically rich, analysis of a historical moment,” Sandler said.</p><p>Stuyvesant held a school level competition that determined who would go to the city and state level competitions. “If you [did] well at the city competition at the Museum of the City of New York,  you [would] go to the state competition at Cooperstown, and if you [did] well [there], you [would] go to nationals at Maryland,” Sandler said.</p><p>Rakshit chose to create a website for his project. It focused on Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian historical figure born in the late 19th century. Due to his socioeconomic state, Dr. Ambedkar was treated as an untouchable, but he went on to lead the first successful movement toward dismantling India caste system, and was also one of the founding fathers of India. “He wrote India’s constitution and through it he embodied all of the principles of justice and equality that he had always advocated for,” Rakshit said. “I wanted to find out what [Dr.] Ambedkar’s policies did for the people they were supposed to empower. I wanted to understand this from the lower caste point of view.”</p><p>Like many others throughout the globe, Rakshit is awed by Dr. Ambedkar’s work. “I am still blown aback [by] the impact he had in shaping India [and] his struggle against not only British colonists, but also his fellow Indians. It is a really powerful message in our modern time when more and more people are getting involved in activism around empowering minorities and underprivileged people,” Rakshit said.</p><p>Unlike most Stuyvesant NHD participants, Rakshit entered the competition as an independent, or without a teacher. Instead, he heard of the competition from his friend and junior Michael Xu, president of the History Club. “I am thankful that he convinced me to do it,” Rakshit said. “I personally didn’t expect to get this far.”</p><p>Ngo, Lin, and Gao’s project focused on Love Canal, a town in upstate New York where residents demanded the U.S. government clean up a toxic waste dump created by the Hooker Chemical Company. This led to the creation of the Superfund Law, which forced the government to allocate a portion of its budget toward cleaning up toxic waste sites. “Before Love Canal there were 30,000 other toxic waste dumps in the country and the federal government wasn’t doing anything about it.  After Love Canal and the creation of Superfund, the federal government started taking responsibility for cleaning up these toxic waste dumps and that is why it is a turning point in environmental history,”  Ngo said.</p><p>The group decided to choose Love Canal as their topic due to its STEM prevalence. “I first learned about Love Canal through another class at Stuy[vesant]: Urban Ecology. [Though] we weren’t able to discuss the topic in depth, this project allowed me to go in-depth and explore all of the connections between Love Canal and environmental history,” Lin said.</p><p>Rakshit, Ngo, Lin, and Gao are now looking forward to the National NHD competition in Maryland. “I have enjoyed the entire process. [Going to Nationals] is just a bonus I feel.  I am excited to see what I can do at Nationals because the level of competition is pretty different there,” Rakshit said.</p>	Article	130	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
765	﻿Student Wins Best Paper Award at CNERT Workshop Junior Caleb Smith-Salzberg wins best paper award at IEEE INFOCOM CNERT workshop. <p>Junior Caleb Smith-Salzberg won the Best Paper Award for his entry, “Bridging the Digital Divide Between Research and Home Networks,” at the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM) in Atlanta on May 1. He had previously presented his paper on April 21 at the New York University (NYU) Research Expo held at the Tandon School of Engineering.</p><p>Smith-Salzberg’s project aims to narrow the gap between the top-notch internet connections that researchers usually have with the much poorer quality connections that average Americans have. “I created a tool that makes it easy for researchers to exactly mimic the internet speeds and connections of an actual U.S. household that is sampled from a dataset of over 10 thousand households,” Smith-Salzberg said in an e-mail interview.</p><p>Last year, Smith-Salzberg was admitted into NYU’s ARISE program, which gives high school students an opportunity to conduct search over the summer with researchers. Here, he began his project that would eventually lead to his paper. “I wanted to challenge myself with different coding problems and expand my knowledge of graphing and using libraries of code. I also wanted to work with huge amounts of data,” he said. His mentor in the program was Fraida Fund of the Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications lab at NYU.</p><p>Smith-Salzberg collaborated with Fund to finalize his research project during the summer. By the end of the program, he had programmed a successfully functioning script, and had completed his main goal. However, Smith-Salzberg and Fund continued to work extensively on the project after the program and the two worked together on Smith-Salzberg’s final paper.</p><p>Smith-Salzberg was able to first present his findings to field professionals and professors at the NYU Research Expo in late April. “It was extremely useful in preparation for the [IEEE INFOCOM],” he said.</p><p>A week later, Smith-Salzberg went to the IEEE INFOCOM conference to present his work. Out of the hundreds of participants, Smith-Salzberg competed directly against seven other presenters in his workshop, which focused on computer and networking experimental research.</p><p>Many of Smith-Salzberg’s competitors were graduate students and possessed more experience in the field of research. “I was very prepared for the presentation at the conference because at that point I had been pitching my project for around nine months. Making a presentation for a more professional audience was not very difficult,” he said. “I did not think I was going to win, and was super excited when it was announced.”</p><p>Smith-Salzberg  is eager to see people using and developing his tool. “All the code is open source, so anyone can suggest edits or built on it, “ he said. “I [learned] a great deal about the importance of reproducibility in research, and taking note of everything done.”</p><p>He is excited about the future of the program and encourages more students to take advantage of the computer science program at Stuyvesant. “After spending the summer with many graduate students who major or minor in computer science, I can say Stuyvesant prepares you extraordinarily well for the field,” Smith-Salzberg said.</p>	Article	131	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

The visit, titled “Behind Bars: A Look at the American Prison System,” aligned with Stuyvesant Amnesty International’s goals to educate students on human rights and encourage student action.</p><p>Bernal began by describing his experience living in crime-infested Hudson County, New Jersey. He went on to describe his move to the largely upper class Bergen County, as his parents believed the Hudson County environment was having a negative effect on him. However, moving to Bergen County did not stop Bernal from stealing bicycles and vandalizing walls.</p><p>Bernal was eventually arrested after getting into a fight with a group of teens who harassed him. He was later told that as a result of the fight, two people were dead and two were injured.</p><p>Bernal was presumed to have caused the deaths and injuries, and was charged with provocation manslaughter. He was tried as an adult, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He went through multiple pleas for parole and was eventually released on October 18, 2004, after serving 12 years.</p><p>In his speech, Bernal emphasized the ineffectiveness of the prison system and tried to spread awareness. “Nothing's [going to] change in the prison system, nothing's [going to] change in the world if people don't care,” Bernal said. “I want to help anyone who is on the wrong path get back on the right path.”</p><p>Co-presidents and juniors Selina Zou and Nowshin Islam met Bernal at an Amnesty International workshop at Columbia University in March where he spoke about solitary confinement. “Sometimes we can get stuck in our own little bubbles at Stuyvesant, which is completely understandable, but we brought Carlos to remind people that there is a lot going on outside of these school walls and that we should care,” junior and co-vice president Joyce Wu said.</p><p>The visit had an effect on many of the students in the audience.  “[I] never really heard a story like his before. I was in awe of how he constantly stayed hopeful in all his time in prison, with his main motivation being his mother. I was glad to hear that after prison he still did not give up on life and was able to start his own business and family. And then started going around to different schools to share his story.” junior Levi Olevsky said.</p><p>Bernal ended by challenging conceptions of the prison experience. “[Prison is] not like the movies, not like candyland, something in between. You just have to find and navigate through it. [...] My biggest takeaway is that you can be the good change,” Bernal said.</p>	Article	134	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
767	﻿StuyHacks Hosts Its Fourth Hackathon StuyHacks hosts its fourth hackathon to emerge high-school students in computer science. <p>StuyHacks held its fourth hackathon, StuyHacks IV, on Saturday, May 27, and Sunday, May 28. The event provided an opportunity for 175 high-school students from the U.S. and Canada to learn about and to immerse themselves in computer science.</p><p>A hackathon is an event where programmers can collaborate on a range of computer science projects. The hackathon organizers secured the sponsorship of a number of technology companies, including Facebook, MakeSchool, RedSeal, and ThoughtWorks, to subsidize the event. The event was held in the Midtown office of ThoughtWorks.</p><p>StuyHacks worked together with the computer science department and the Dojo, which is an afterschool community for computer science enthusiasts, to recruit mentors to help teach at the hackathon. “Mentors [were] generally college students who are majoring in Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Some mentors [were] also students from Stuyvesant who are currently taking post-AP level courses,” senior and StuyHacks logistics director Prangon Ghose said.</p><p>During the hackathon, attendees were organized into groups of two to four for a team-building session. These teams competed against one another as they worked on a variety of programming projects, from developing a mobile app to building a robot.</p><p>Alongside the competitions, multiple workshops were held throughout the event to teach attendees different computer science skills and languages. For example, junior Shakil Rafi led the Android Development workshop, which taught participants how to code apps for the Android operating system.</p><p>At the end of StuyHacks IV, a panel of judges evaluated the group projects and gave out multiple awards based off of them. Seniors Nicholas Ng, Anya Keller, Mikhail Kotlik, and Daniel Monteagudo came in third place for the best overall project award for their work on Politalk, a website inspired by the 2016 election that connects people with opposing political ideologies through a chat app.</p><p>For future hackathons, StuyHacks organizers hope to increase funding to expand the event by reserving a larger venue and adding more workshops. Despite this, StuyHacks IV was well received by many of its attendees. “Having been to past StuyHacks, it is amazing to see all the improvements done over the years to benefit programmers,” senior Kevin Zhang said.</p>	Article	135	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
768	﻿Kinet-X: Three Juniors’ Mission to Teach STEM to Younger Minds “Seeing a kid’s eyes light up when their code works is a feeling that you really can’t match.” ––Adam Abbas, junior <p>“Seeing a kid’s eyes light up when their code works is a feeling that you really can’t match.” ––Adam Abbas, junior</p><p>Stuyvesant serves as an intellectual incubator; students are given the opportunity to learn and grow alongside professionals in various fields.  Renowned in particular for its computer science department, Stuyvesant allows students to hone in on their engineering interests through a multitude of courses and extracurriculars, both inside and outside of the school.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sea of opportunity is relatively exclusive to Stuyvesant and other specialized high schools. For example, out of over 42,000 high schools in the United States, only about 2,100 are certified to teach computer science. In schools that do offer the course, teachers often aren’t required to hold a degree with a concentration in the field. Computer science and engineering courses are even more scarce in elementary and secondary schools.</p><p>Juniors Adam Abbas, Chauncey Lau, and Allan Wang quickly identified and tried to reconcile this gap in education. When the trio joined Stuyvesant’s Robotics team, they were shocked to discover how little the incoming members of the team actually knew. In January of 2016, Abbas, Lau, and Wang originally came up with the idea to run a small Robotics training camp for incoming Stuyvesant freshmen.</p><p>However, upon further research and the discovery that lack of STEM education was a trend countrywide, they decided to do what they could to change that. “We realized that the issue, [ a lack of STEM education],  applied to everyone, not just people interested in robotics. So, we expanded our idea to teach basic STEM concepts,” explains Lau. Months of planning, hours of email drafting, advertising, marketing, meetings with tech companies, and late nights culminated into the group’s initiative: Kinet-X.The idea for a small training camp for Stuyvesant newcomers evolved into a four-week summer immersion program.</p><p>“I remember thinking that we had to have snacks set up. Before we started teaching on our first day, we ran everyone through a brainstorming workshop. We wanted to see the level of our students and also to get them to start thinking in the less traditional, memorization based way,” Abbas said. “I was really scared that when I started teaching they just really wouldn’t enjoy it. A lot of people just don’t like CS, and being responsible for trying to inspire a room of kids is tough. There really wasn’t anything I could do other than follow my lesson plan and just make sure everyone was having the best time possible.”</p><p>“One big problem was finding a place to host our program. We thought about using a co-working space, but that would bump up the price [of the program] significantly,” explained Lau. “We reached out to a couple of places and found that people were willing to help us out. We worked with Beam Center, an amazing place with all of the materials and space we could ever need.”</p><p>That summer, Abbas taught web development and JavaScript to a group of five students, Lau introduced soldering and circuitry, and Wang continued to work on marketing of the program.</p><p>The three friends had all been exposed to basic engineering and computer science education: Abbas took computer science courses in middle school, Lau learned from his father, an electrical engineer, and Wang taught himself code at the age of eleven.</p><p>“When I was younger, my father was pretty busy with work. When he did get home, he’d always be tinkering with something, so my interactions with him always involved teaching me something related to technology,” Lau recalled. “He once yelled at me for creating a short circuit, which is basically when you connect a battery to itself. I didn’t understand why, so I did it again by myself, and the battery got really hot and burned me.”</p><p>The trio’s own hands-on experiences with STEM in childhood is reflected in how teaching is approached at Kinet-X: all lessons revolve around project based learning, as opposed to the typical lecture based classroom setting.</p><p>“We’ve made solar powered cars from parts from old computers, which was pretty cool because they had to find things that can act as wheels, chassis and other things from scrap. I want them to realize that not only is this really fun, but also super useful,” Lau said. “I like showing my students what happens when you mess up, so they don’t get too curious and hurt themselves on their own. That’s the only way to teach kids without them getting bored and hating the topic.”</p><p>Now, Kinet-X offers twelve weekend sessions of the same curriculum to a group of ten 10-13 year-olds. Kinet-X’s program targets all middle schoolers, regardless of socioeconomic background. The program gets no outside funding and covers costs of equipment and other expenses through tuition rates: $1350 for the summer. However, financial-aid is offered for those who cannot afford to pay full price.</p><p>The Kinet-X day is split up into two parts—engineering and programming. Students spend three hours in the beginning of the day going over engineering concepts such as soldering, circuitry, and electricity. They are then given an hour lunch break that they can use to relax, socialize, or work on their projects. Post-break, students finish the day with a three-hour programming session, where they spend their time learning programming concepts and applying them to projects and other activities.</p><p>“When I am teaching off of a PowerPoint, I try to make it as engaging as possible, with puzzles and thought-provoking questions woven between the bullet points and factoids,” Abbas explained. “In the engineering portion, entire lessons can be spent soldering a circuit together or building a project.”</p><p>“The best part is when you see how focused the kids are and how much they want to solve the issues they’ve come across,” Lau said. “The worst part is when they start getting a bit too rowdy and become safety hazards; but, that doesn’t happen too often, and it’s easy to calm them down.”</p><p>What makes Kinet-X unique is its teachers—the closeness in age between teacher and student, obvious aptitude of the instructors in their subject areas, as well as the passion those instructors hold––evident when Abbas’s eyes lit up whilst describing their mission. “We focus more on inspiring our students, rather than just passing on knowledge and information for them to spit back out at us,” Adam said. “We want them to fall in love with STEM and pursue it outside of our classes. We want our students to come back to us and ask to help-out, or for more resources, or for assistance on a code that all of us wrote together. Personally, I want to see my students a year from now and feel like my class stuck with them.”</p><p>For their 2017 summer immersion program,  Kinet-X has expanded to include an intermediate level to their curriculum. “Our students kept telling us they wished they had an opportunity to take our classes again and learn more,” Abbas explained. The intermediate course introduces Python and Arduino to students.</p><p>The trio plan to continue to expand their program to include a greater variety of classes and grow their following to include more students. Publicity from various publications, including foreign language newspapers and the Wall Street Journal, help Kinet-X attract an even greater following.</p><p>As a result of the program’s rapid growth, Abbas, Lau, and Wang all plan to remain in New York City post-high school to further expand and develop their vision. “It’s a big part of our lives, and we’d really like to continue it when we’re in college, if we get in,” Lau said.  “That being said, if we’re not able to work on it personally, we’ve taken precautions to make sure it continues with other people in charge.”</p><p>Though juggling a new start-up and other responsibilities, like school-work, seems daunting, staying conscious of Kinet-X’s impact helps its founders stay grounded. “When I was on the robotics team, I was helping myself and my team, and learning new things. But it wasn’t fulfilling work or knowledge for me. Kinet-X lets me actually make a difference. I learn so much through teaching, and seeing a kid’s eyes light up when their code works is a feeling that you really can’t match,” Abbas said.</p><p>Their advice to anyone looking to start their own business is to start with a passion, and see what ways it can be utilized to make a difference. “What problems are there? What do people wish was changed?” Abbas said. “You might end up only working on a project on a small scale, but if you keep trying to solve issues and follow what you already know and do, you’ll eventually find what works for you and be able to continue on with it.”</p>	Article	137	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
769	﻿Uncontested; Unelected?  <p>An unopposed candidacy might signify incredible popularity, and a margin of victory of 100 percent. It could also signify a lack of opposition, and of civic engagement. In the worst case, the election may be coerced. James Monroe was elected President of the United States by a margin of 228-1 in 1820; Kim Jong-un was elected President of North Korea by a margin of 687-0 in 2014. From overwhelming approval to coercion, the most recent Student Union (SU) elections fall somewhere in between.</p><p>Bitter liberals like to whine about the low democratic turnout in America’s presidential election, but Stuyvesant is much worse, routinely seeing only a minority of the student body vote. This year, the SU and Senior Caucus elections stooped to a new level of apathy, each featuring a single candidacy. Junior Kevin Boodram, who ran for caucus three times in the past, said, “ I don’t think people understand what the Student Union does. I think that discourages a lot people from running in the first place, even voting.” His older brother’s friends told him the SU was only good for planning parties.</p><p>Yet the SU organizes perhaps the biggest display of school spirit each year, SING!. The SU’s impressive budget of over $100,000 is what makes clubs and publications possible. And the President and Vice President routinely meet with school administration as the ones advocating for the student body. Perhaps it is time to pay more attention to election season.</p><p>If presented with the opportunity to cast a ballot, I surely would have voted for Tahseen Chowdhury and Alexa Valentino for Student Union President and Vice President, as well as for Pallab Saha and Abie Rohrig for Senior Caucus; the problem, however, is that not a single ballot was cast. With the student body’s interests at stake, it is dangerous to have an uncontested—and therefore unelected—official in power (see North Korea).</p><p>A more troubling trend, however, seems to be damaging SU elections: the toxic environment surrounding challenges to the incumbent. Most recently, sophomore Abner Kahan faced personal attacks over Facebook for trying to run for positions in the Student Union. “Most people laughed at me and didn’t take me seriously. Some were even slightly hostile,” Kahan said.</p><p>Hostility directly discourages students from running. It is hard enough to break into the SU—incumbents have the advantage of knowing the organization’s inner-workings, evidenced by a six-year chain of SU Vice Presidents becoming President. Bullying is not only degrading, but makes the task impossible; Kahan gave up on running for Student Union, and eventually pulled out of the Junior Caucus race—his ideas were effectively silenced.</p><p>Boodram added that it is very difficult for candidates to run after suffering a loss. “If you lose a campaign, and you try to do anything after that, people are always going to flame you and say you’re salty or whatever and criticize you for trying to run again,” he said, nodding vigorously when asked if he was bullied. Stuyvesant students are quick to transgress the boundary from debating policies to personal attacks.</p><p>SU elections have always been meaningful; now it is time for the student body to treat them professionally. Innovation and competition are crucial to testing ideas and ensuring our Student Union provides us with the best experience they can, but this is only possible if we are open to new ideas and have the confidence that, when we choose to speak out, others will respect our voices.</p>	Article	139	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

For just $8.75, this dish combines rich Yunnan history and flavor into one large, hot bowl of soup. Supposedly, a woman used to cross a bridge everyday in the Yunnan province to bring her husband this dish, and she found that the soup stayed warm when covered in a layer of chicken fat and that it tasted best when all the toppings and noodles were added last, so that is exactly how the dish is served today.</p><p>Rice Noodles</p><p>$5.75-$6.75</p><p>The restaurant is famous for its housemade rice noodles, and any of its rice noodle dishes are a must-try.

771	﻿Everything, Everything About This Love Story “Everything, Everything” is a well-done romantic movie for those who are into the genre. <p>Imagine never leaving your house for 17 years, never being able to go outside, never seeing the ocean, despite it only being three miles away from your house, and never having much physical contact with others, with only the Internet and books to base real life on.</p><p>That is the life doe-eyed protagonist Maddy Whittier (Amandla Stenberg) has to live. Diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), she is trapped in her house, as she would get sick if she walked outside. Spoiler alert: she does not die.</p><p>Instead, she is saved by her undying love for Olly Bright (Nick Robinson), the boy next door who is a gentleman that desperately needs a haircut.</p><p>Directed by Stella Meghie, “Everything, Everything,” is a riveting love story about an intelligent girl who is drawn outdoors once she starts texting a boy who just became her neighbor. As based on the book by Nicola Yoon, Maddy only starts asking questions about her illness and her monotonous life as she falls more in love with Olly and begins to feel trapped.</p><p>Stenberg and Robinson are able to sell Maddy and Olly’s love with their undeniable chemistry. They have everything down, from the way they lovingly look at each other in the car to the way Olly’s face lights up with concern and fear as soon as he sees Maddy outside. The duo allows their flirty banter to seem genuine and emotional rather than cheesy and cliché, building off of each other’s thoughts seamlessly without overdoing the laughter and the blushes. The flawless acting makes many root for the star-crossed lovers, especially when they throw caution into the wind and kiss for the first time, which can end Maddy’s life.</p><p>Maddy and Olly’s love is only amplified with Meghie’s stylistic choices. Instead of showing two people texting, which is what this couple is forced to do the majority of the time, Meghie decides to use Maddy’s architecture class to her advantage. For assignments, Maddy is forced to build diners, libraries, and houses. Maddy then imagines all of her and Olly’s texts to be said face-to-face in these architectural models. Whenever she picks up her phone and smiles, the camera fades into her imagination, emitting a whimsical, dreamy aura as they share their true feelings. This only enhances Maddy and Olly’s love story; having the audience see Stenberg and Robinson say the texts out loud with passion illustrates the true emotions they feel when they text each other. Their love, figuratively and literally, comes off the screen.</p><p>The movie, however, has obvious discontinuities. For example, Maddy states at the beginning of the film that she has 100 white t-shirts, but she is only seen in one in the starting scene and wears blue crop tops for the rest of the movie. In addition, Olly comments that Maddy is too close to him the third time they are five feet apart from each other. While many die-hard romance fans will shrug off these moments, those who aren’t as keen on romance will have problems with this.</p><p>In fact, some who are not as inclined to romance movies might be disgusted by the unrealistic fantasy that “Everything, Everything” describes. Skeptics would notice the sheer impossibility of things such as Maddy and Olly’s trip to Hawaii occurring. How did Maddy get on the airplane without a photo I.D., which is something she would be unlikely to get if she’s been trapped in her house for 17 years? How is she going to afford the trip once her credit card bill arrives in the mail? While some may only pay attention to the adorable couple, others will note the absurdity of the plot.</p><p>Those who have read the book, however, will expect this impractical romance, as the movie surprisingly sticks firmly to the plot of the book. The minor details left out of the movie, such as Olly knowing how to do a handstand or having a rooftop hideout, are easily forgotten. Some changes are even beneficial to the plot, such as Carla’s, Maddy’s nurse, daughter (Danube R. Hermosillo) playing a bigger role in Maddy’s life, visiting her to talk about Maddy’s budding social life.</p><p>However, one missed addition from the novel was Olly making sure Maddy had a condom before they had sex. The sex scene was refreshingly tame, but this one detail from the book would have gone a long way had it been included in the film. The film would have taught its audience about the reality of contraceptives, something historically not touched on in TV shows and movies and especially important with the teenage audience this movie targets.</p><p>The movie has been praised for its diverse cast, as Amandla Stenberg, a black girl, plays the lead in a love story. A major upside with this story is how it allows a girl of color to fall in love with a white boy on the big screen without race playing a large factor in the plot, normalizing the concept of interracial couples. Additionally, Meghie, the director of the film, is the only black female director thus far in 2017 to come out with a wide-release movie. Yoon, the author of the book “Everything, Everything” is based on, is an immigrant from Jamaica, and she has spoken about how important it is for all races to be represented in media. Her novel and its movie adaptation is a step in the right direction.</p><p>The movie, however, has been criticized for misrepresenting SCID, the disease Maddy has. The Immune Deficiency Foundation released a press statement this week condemning the inaccuracies the movie presented, such as when Maddy describes it as “being allergic to everything.” These inaccuracies are intentional, as the audience is not taught about the destructiveness of SCID. Instead, they learn about the horrors of Munchausen by proxy, a mental disorder where a caretaker makes their child believe that they have some sort of terminal illness. The film accurately depicts symptoms for Munchausen by proxy, with the mother being highly interested in medical affairs. Because of this, the SCID symptoms Maddy exhibits should not be taken seriously. Instead, they should be used to combat stereotypes about people with SCID, such as having to live in highly quarantined areas.</p><p>“Everything, Everything” originally sounds like a similar story to “The Fault In Our Stars,” with the illnesses and the impromptu magical vacation. However, the themes that “Everything, Everything” touch on are completely different, focusing on the nuances and contradictions that love and family bring instead of constantly reminding the audience of life and death, like “The Fault In Our Stars” does. While “The Fault in Our Stars” emphasizes the importance of living life to the fullest, “Everything, Everything” stresses forming relationships with others and understanding others’ motives.</p><p>And, of course, no one dies at the end of “Everything, Everything.”</p><p>The thing about both of these films is that despite all the horrible things Maddy and Hazel, the protagonist of “The Fault In Our Stars,” go through, their spirits are not crushed. They can still live with their head held high. While Maddy and Hazel are both terminally ill and have amazing romances, they do not allow these things to define them. Each of them are still her own person. “Everything, Everything” is powerful for this reason and sends the message to viewers that no matter what, you can power through anything.</p>	Article	146	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
772	﻿How to Be a 2017 New York Times Bestseller: An Ode to a Bawse A$$ Book A review of Lilly Singh’s new book “How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life.” <p>Every so often, the narration of a book comes to life in the form of a person—a well-fleshed character springing from its pages to look you in the eye to share a sincere moment. In her 2017 book, “How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life,” Lilly Singh’s witty, heartfelt words of wisdom take the form of the cool aunt you wish you had.</p><p>Singh’s aptly named book is an extensive how-to guide on absolutely winning at life. When giving life and career advice, she draws from personal experience as her primary source material. The integration of personal anecdotes in her unadulterated advice gives “How to Be a Bawse” its sense of intimacy.</p><p>She establishes the informal nature of her book in the introduction, stating “I’m not an expert and I’m not claiming to be one…I’m writing this…because I want to be a positive light in this world.” In this statement, the book’s purpose is made clear: Singh, as a wildly successful entertainer, entrepreneur, and all-around bawse, has reached out to the public in book-form to share her secrets and help us all achieve total bawsedom.</p><p>However, bits and pieces of Lilly Singh existed in the public sphere long before she published her book. Her loud, confident, and refreshingly honest voice has graced the computer screens of millions since 2010, when she started her YouTube channel, “IISuperwomanII.” On this channel, she primarily posts a variety of comedic skits relating to certain aspects of her life, the most notable of which are videos impersonating her Punjabi parents, Manjeet and Paramjeet Singh, reacting to pop culture and the modern world.</p><p>When she first created her channel, she was a recent college graduate who filmed videos as a means of alleviating her crippling depression. “IISuperwomanII” has acquired 11 million subscribers and 1.8 billion views in the six and a half years following, making Singh one of the most successful YouTube celebrities of all time.</p><p>She nods to her former battle with depression many times throughout the book. Many of the life lessons covered in “How to Be a Bawse” are ones she has learned in her long, grueling path to recovery. In her introduction, she establishes that she is writing from the perspective of someone who has overcome depression.</p><p>Her book is divided into four sections, titled “Master Your Mind,” “Hustle Harder,” “Make Heads Turn,” and “Be a Unicorn.” Each section consists of nine to 17 chapters of mini-lessons and pieces of advice and ends with a feature called “Out of the Blue,” where she looks back on a moment in her life when she was depressed and contrasts it with her life after recovery.</p><p>Singh’s second installation of “Out of the Blue” recalls her state of mind in 2010 and 2015. She felt unimportant and invisible in 2010—the temple being her only sanctuary. “I go there every day and sit in the back, as far away from everyone else as possible. But I still feel as if everyone is looking at me.” She notes that in 2015, having people look at her has become a positive aspect of her life: “I see a huge sign with flashing lights outside the venue that reads ‘Lilly Singh’s “A Trip to Unicorn Island”—SOLD OUT.’”</p><p>The optimistic side-by-side comparison of the before and after is especially uplifting and refreshing, particularly to those struggling with depression themselves. It reinforces and cements all of the ideas conveyed in the book by reminding readers that life can—and does—get better.</p><p>Excluding the recurring feature “Out of the Blue,” “How to Be a Bawse” has 50 chapters in total. Each chapter conveys a new life lesson in around three to five pages. Some chapters have cliché titles like “Don’t Overthink” and “Commit to Your Decisions,” while others have titles that are distinctly Lilly Singh, such as “Send the GPS Deep,” where she tells you to be introspective and address your inner issues.</p><p>Each chapter achieves the perfect balance between hilarity and seriousness, articulating genuine, sincere pieces of advice with “Game of Thrones” references and funny poems about vodka and soda. Singh’s success as a YouTuber is evident in her writing style, from the quippy, anecdotal intros to every chapter to the colloquialisms she uses to convey her ideas.</p><p>In her opening paragraph to “Let Go of FOMO,” she draws her reader in with an interesting, relatable concept: “If I had a dollar for every time I was tempted to hang out with friends instead of doing work, I’d have a yacht made of gold.” She closes off the paragraph with the hashtag “#YachtGoals,” a model example of the humorous language that has won over her young fanbase in her book and videos alike.</p><p>While Singh’s writing style is very resemblant of her vlogging style, many YouTubers who have written books have chosen to divert from their vlogging style, writing long, detailed sections of prose in the style of a traditional novel.</p><p>Though exploring every lesson in depth would have added a wonderful new dimension to “How to Be a Bawse” and the public’s perception of Lilly Singh, the concise, unconventional style the book is written in conveys Singh’s messages just as well. Through her writing, Singh brings an extra touch of heart to her already stellar advice.</p><p>There is no better person to tell you to get some exercise than the person who prefaces the “Be Active” chapter of her book with, “I am literally LOLing as I write this chapter because I am the least qualified person to do so.”</p><p>The layout of the book’s hardcover copy is similarly bright—before every chapter, a bold, stunning professional photo of Singh takes up a full page. Almost every page is touched with neon colors, and most chapters have at least one outquote in a bright color and a bolded, stylish font. The lively color scheme and uplifting, bolded outquotes reinforce the book’s positive message and the importance of self-betterment.</p><p>The way “How to Be a Bawse” exhibits Lilly Singh’s trademark boldness has garnered an overwhelmingly positive reaction from Singh’s long-time fans and has also won the hearts of new fans. As of May 2017, the book has become a #1 New York Times bestseller, and it currently has a whopping 4.8 out of 5 stars on Amazon.</p><p>There are many reasons why this book could have achieved these impressive feats, but above all, its success can be attributed to the fact that it is a true anomaly. It is simultaneously sentimental and practical, silly and sincere, and a gold mine of wisdom.</p><p>Without a doubt, “How to Be a Bawse” is a must-have for every human being struggling through life on this cold, lonely planet, aka every human, period.</p>	Article	149	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

It had high expectations to live up to, thanks to the popularity of its prequel and the two Marvel movies that preceded it, “Captain America: Civil War” and “Doctor Strange.” With stunning visuals of the intergalactic world, witty banter, and the unforgettable soundtrack known as “Awesome Mix Vol. 2,” the film will definitely be ranked along with the others as a success.</p><p>“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is about the Guardians, Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Baby Groot, continuing their journey throughout the cosmos. Along the way, they run into Ego, a god who claims to be the father of Star-Lord, or Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). When Ego is revealed to be their true enemy, the team manages to work out disputes and grow closer in order to take him down.</p><p>Though its thrilling space battles and futuristic technology make it the ideal action or science fiction movie, what really makes the film stand out is its focus on family.</p><p>The movie shows perhaps the most interesting relationship between two female siblings in a Marvel movie. Sisters Gamora and Nebula were nemeses, to the point where neither one would hesitate to kill the other if needed.</p><p>The circumstances of their rivalry (with their father replacing a part of Nebula with machinery every time she lost in combat to Gamora) make it a situation many can relate to. At its core, the problem boils down to Nebula feeling outshined by her older sister and unappreciated by her father. Those with older siblings would definitely be able to form some sort of emotional connection to this, giving a powerful emotional payoff.</p><p>As an act of vengeance, Nebula vows to kill Gamora and her father for the pain she went through. She steals a ship in order to hunt Gamora down and they engage in an almost deadly fight once she finds her. After their battle ends in a draw, Nebula says one of the most powerful lines of the movie: “You always wanted to win. I just wanted a sister.”</p><p>Through this line, Nebula changes from an enemy to a victim in both Gamora’s and the viewer’s eyes. Gamora’s understanding of Nebula’s true feelings allows the two to finally reach an armistice and work together as an unshakable team, with each one willing to save the other’s life without hesitation. Their sweet hug toward the end of the movie represents the union of a family, in which Nebula finally gets the sister she had always wanted.</p><p>The conflict between the Guardians themselves is a bit cliché; Marvel already used the “unable to work as a team” plot tool in both of their “Avengers” movies. The argument between Peter and Rocket about who is the best pilot fails to stir any sort of emotion within the viewer, instead looking more like a typical bout over dominance between two males. Drax’s obnoxious personality, Rocket’s refusal of letting anyone get close to him and the team’s general inability to understand one another cause an amount of feuds that is borderline tiresome.</p><p>Even the revelation of Ego’s sinister nature, which is the main plot line of the film, feels overplayed. Dozens of movies, a notable example being “Star Wars” regarding Darth Vader, have used the “character’s long lost relative is actually evil” theme.</p><p>It’s the growth of each Guardian that makes the movie special and allows them to become more of a family rather than a simple team. Rocket finds it within himself to admit he cares for his teammates. Drax is the one who declares them a family. During the final battle, each Guardian is unwilling to leave any member behind, even if it means death. Their character developments weave together to create a beautiful story of a family that refuses to leave anyone behind.</p><p>The driving force of the entire movie is Yondu. Despite being a former enemy and almost maniacal when it comes to using his trademark red arrow to murder his own traitorous crew members, who tried to stop him from reaching the Guardians, he ends up being the most significant hero of all.</p><p>Yondu is the one who looks out for Peter the most. His true intentions of raising Peter himself instead of returning him to Ego turn out to be honest and noble, and he ends up being the one to teach Star-Lord how to master his newfound celestial power. Yondu’s character arc of him growing from a hated villain to a valiant father figure and Guardian results in one of the most riveting villain-turned-hero stories in The Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p><p>“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” is unable to recreate the original fun and greatness of the first. However, by choosing to make it a tale of family, it strengthens the emotional impact on the viewer and proves itself to be a worthy cinematic piece without needing to use the fame behind its prequel or the Marvel brand.</p>	Article	153	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
774	﻿The Privilege of Peeing A review of the STC’s 2017 spring comedy/musical, Urinetown. <p>The curtains of the Murray Kahn Theater opened to a grim color scheme of yellow and black, topped with a garbage green brick wall that read “Public Amenity #9,” the most disgusting urinal in town. The arrangement of set pieces was intentionally messy, setting a backdrop for the varying levels of chaos that would ensue for the duration of the show.</p><p>The Stuyvesant Theater Community (STC)’s 2017 spring musical comedy, “Urinetown,” can only be described as a brilliantly orchestrated disaster. From atrocious, mismatched outfits to the use of toilet paper as twirling ribbons, impeccable choices were made in all departments to capture the crooked, chaotic universe of “Urinetown.” The show, directed by seniors Enver Ramadani and Dennis Ronel and sophomore Kareena Singh, ran on May 31 and June 2-3, and made for one of the most impressive STC shows in a while.</p><p>“Urinetown” is set in a fictional town that has suffered from a 20-year drought, which has led to the privatization of all of the toilets in town. The toilets, or filthy public amenities, are controlled by the Urine Good Company (UGC), led by the villainous Caldwell B. Cladwell (sophomore Adam Elsayed). People do their business on a pay-to-pee basis, and if they don’t comply, they get exiled to a penal colony called Urinetown.</p><p>The cast is split between a ragtag team of poor, angry townspeople and the people in charge. The juxtaposition between the poor protagonists and the powerful antagonists is written as an extreme cliché, and the STC cast successfully conveyed the “heroes vs. villains” trope. However, as a show that routinely breaks the fourth wall and interacts with the audience in a sketch comedic manner, “Urinetown” is far from a mere cliché. Throughout the show, the lines between hero and villain are blurred through heartwarming and heart-wrenching plot twists followed by exaggerated ensemble reactions.</p><p>The intimidating, rule-enforcing Officer Lockstock (senior Leith Conybeare) opened the show with a spine-chilling monologue detailing the town’s unfortunate situation. Lockstock was soon joined by adorable, doe-eyed Little Sally (senior Nadia Filanovsky), who routinely made quips about hydraulics and remarks that broke the fourth wall, such as, “This isn’t a happy musical.” Little Sally was able to bring out the softer side of Officer Lockstock, and the heartwarming rapport between Coneybeare and Filanovsky was one of the highlights of the show.</p><p>The two shined onstage individually, as well. Coneybeare hit every comedic beat and nailed the many complex layers of Lockstock’s character. In “Too Much Exposition,” her gorgeous voice rang through the auditorium. Likewise, Filanovsky thoughtfully portrayed Little Sally’s character arc, leading up to a breathtaking performance for her grand solo in “Tell Her I Love Her,” where her powerful Broadway belt truly packed a punch.</p><p>Another standout performance was senior Jessica Sparacio’s Penelope Pennywise, the rigid, unforgiving woman who runs Public Amenity #9. Sparacio captured both the rough edges and the raw emotion of Pennywise with a mind-blowing attention to detail, from her aggressive physicality to the way she spat on every “p” in “It’s a Privilege to Pee.” Alongside Sparacio’s stellar acting were her unbelievable vocals. A bona fide mezzo belter, Sparacio hit the song’s high notes with ease.</p><p>However, these three were only several of the great performances in “Urinetown.” Elsayed’s portrayal of the malevolent Mr. Cladwell was hilarious and entertaining, and junior Travis Tyson’s rendition of Pennywise’s loveable, fresh-faced assistant Bobby Strong carried some of the show’s most emotional moments.</p><p>Even the smaller characters, who spent most of their time in the ensemble, stole the show for their small moments in the spotlight. Freshman Victoria Wong, as the poor, pregnant Little Becky Two-Shoes, hobbled around stage with an amazing presence. Senior Jenna Bawer was also a natural onstage as Hot Blades Harry, and her energy was a joy to watch.</p><p>While “Urinetown” boasted countless spectacular individual performances, the characters lacked cohesiveness as an ensemble. It often felt as if the actors were basking in the spotlight when they should have been reacting to each other, especially during moments of dialogue. As such, certain relationships that are pivotal to the “Urinetown” plot were underdeveloped, a particular example being the romantic relationship between Bobby Strong and Hope Cladwell (senior Lillian Carver). While both Tyson and Carver were evidently talented actors, they lacked chemistry as a couple.</p><p>For the most part, the show’s ensemble didn’t have this problem. However, some of the smaller characters singing alongside the ensemble were mic’d while the rest of the ensemble wasn’t, and this ruined the sound balance in several songs. “Urinetown,” like many musical comedies, is somewhat of an ensemble-driven show, and the wealth of energy and talent in the ensemble’s songs and dances is a large part of what made this such a successful production.</p><p>Another particularly impressive element of the show was the creativity and attention to detail in the use of props. From toilet plungers to toilet paper, many common household items were used for things other than their intended purposes.</p><p>The layout of papers and cash-filled suitcases on Mr. Cladwell’s desk perfectly brought about the atmosphere of a corporate office, and during the big protest at the end of Act One, the large, messily constructed picket sign reading “FREE THE PEEPL” encapsulated the unique humor of the show. The lighting, costume choices, and the insanely talented band were also artful and professional, contributing to the unparalleled immaculacy of this production.</p><p>The show closed with an uplifting, bluesy performance of “I See A River,” where Carver’s fluid vocals and warm timbre shined. The beautiful music was paired with a classic, corny epilogue narration of what happened to the characters after the story ended. The epilogue was delivered in a wonderfully cringy manner, reminding the audience that “Urinetown” is an emotional rollercoaster of pure satire—a difficult musical to nail, but one that, for the most part, STC successfully did.</p>	Article	154	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
775	﻿2016-2017 Year in Review Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. We came into Stuyvesant last September, saved from the derelict mindlessness and reckless idleness of the... <p>Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. We came into Stuyvesant last September, saved from the derelict mindlessness and reckless idleness of the dreaded summer. Now in June, we are forced to once again contend with the onerous summer, but with a new collection of SAT prep books to accompany us.</p><p>Back in the beginning of the year, Harambe was still a thing, and Pokémon Go made us actually exercise for once. Over the summer, two swanky nominating conventions were held to nominate two insanely popular candidates: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</p><p>Everyone who actually came to the Republican National Committee was pleased, and the entire convention was notably undisturbed. Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake insisted that “mowing his lawn” would take precedence over a political caucus that happens once every four years, and the Kasich- and Cruz-friendly delegations were more than happy to take their seats in the back corners of the convention hall.</p><p>Similarly, at the Democratic National Convention, the talk of the town was former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz’s positive remarks on Bernie Sanders. These remarks were so enthusiastic that Schultz stepped down as DNC chair to lead the #Bernie2020 movement.</p><p>Enough about summer—let’s go relive some good memories with the first day of school. Coming into school the first time in two months, students were seen kissing the scanning machines, kneeling in front of the portrait of Peter Stuyvesant, and rolling around with glee on the pristine half-floor.</p><p>Freshmen were more than delighted to be at Stuyvesant—the school that many have drooled over for 14 years (actually, 15 years counting the time in the womb). Many of them patted themselves on the back while they failed their biology tests and pulled their first all-nighters—just simply proud of the privilege of travelling two hours to and from school.</p><p>Meanwhile, upperclassmen put college on the back of their minds as they began their immersive academic engagement. They signed up for APs, got screwed over by programming, worked for leadership credentials in extracurriculars, and went sleepless for nights on end for self-enrichment. “Yes, the ‘I Created This Club To Look Good For College’ is completely legit,” senior Laszlo Sandler claimed.</p><p>Speaking of Sandler, the U.S. got its very own joke-of-a-president on Election Day—imagine…the entire country was jealous of us! With Trump’s election, many of us were left more shell-shocked than when the MTA decided to cease all service to Manhattan. There was some solace in Clinton’s popular vote count, but just like how everyone on the packed platform is fumingly angry at the MTA, there was no strength in numbers.</p><p>We could go on about Trump, but it’s probably better to lie low before he roots us out. If The Spectator maintained a Twitter presence, we would probably get lambasted by the president, a position that formerly entailed being the leader of the free world. That battle probably wouldn’t end well for us. Sometimes, we actually do let Alternative Facts pass through as News, such as when we announced that programming would be streamlined last semester—of course not! Though, we don’t think we’ve published any covfefe just yet.</p><p>Some underclassmen might have called our SING! coverage covfefe. There’s a lot to commend Soph-Frosh on, such as their brilliant job on the poop-inspired costumes and their innovative plot that in no way resembled 53929 other teenage trilogies. The only criticism from our end was the annoying Jolly Rancher—she sounded nearly as bad as senior Michael Espinosa’s announcements.</p><p>The Foreign Language department planned some terrific events over the last year: they were so engaging that some attendees even forgot that they had originally come to nab extra credit. Now, if only more departments would host extra credit events…</p><p>Springtime meant that there was a student to tissue box ratio of 1:2 and that there was a student to AP prep book ratio of 1:17. In effect, no one had the energy to put up a fight against incumbent Student Union tickets. Given that we live in the age of Laszlo Sandler, however, any inexperienced candidate would’ve won.</p><p>Fidget spinners soon swept the whole school as students began minting them on 3D printers. Before long, there’ll be physics test questions asking about calculating the momentum of a fidget spinner and maybe even a club…</p>	Article	157	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
776	﻿Programming Office: Why? The underclassmen are being given priority when choosing electives and APs, compared to upperclassmen. <p>With AP and elective selections finalized, it has become clear that the programming office has prioritized freshmen this year in assigning APs. Feeling cheated, many upperclassmen have begun congregating outside the programming office in protest, forming longer lines than those outside the library after the warning bell rings.</p><p>“I don’t even understand why the juniors are being so annoying!” freshman Sudat Khan exclaimed. “They’re pretty much going to die from senioritis anyway. They’re obviously not vying for these AP courses to quench their intellectual curiosity nor test the limits of human knowledge.”</p><p>Khan proceeded to flip through his AP Honors Advanced Multivariable Calc BCD textbook, which he plans to take next year alongside AP Physics Z and AP Physical Education.</p><p>Originally, programming used a nine-digit number generator—the OSIS closest to the generated number gets into the AP until all the spots are filled up. However, if the student’s OSIS contains the “unlucky number of the year,” that student is taken off the list. Moreover, if the student could not remember and recite his or her OSIS number on-the-spot in under five seconds, she would be removed.</p><p>Now, students will be assigned APs based on the number of AP prep books that they bought from the student store. Even if the student hasn’t taken the course yet, not buying that extra prep book might be the one thing stopping him or her from getting into that AP course he or she has wanted to take for three years.</p><p>Just to spice things up, programming has a different process for electives. First, programming office members filter out all of the grades of the students who applied. Each semester, they choose a different range. Last semester, only students with an 80.372-87.661 average in second term freshman biology could have applied for genetics with Dr. Nedwidek-Moore. Besides that, it’s a first-come, first-served basis, starting at precisely 12:23:41 a.m. on the night of JProm. If one student submitted his or her form a millisecond before another student, then he or she would get the class.</p><p>With these restrictions, upperclassmen have found that they have a higher chance of winning the lottery than getting into oversubscribed electives such as Forensics. “Winning the lottery was my safety if I didn’t get into Orgo,” junior Ved Patel mourned.</p><p>However, some juniors weren’t fortunate enough to even win the lottery. “What will I possibly do with a lunch period?” junior Daniel Ju grumbled. “My guy, I’m going to get so bored of being able to sleep for more than three hours.”</p><p>Now, starting fall semester of next year, there will be new APs and electives exclusively for juniors. Among a few of them are: “How to Get Into College,” “I Created This Elective to Look Good For College,” and “I Have Not Yet Succumbed to Senioritis.”</p><p>Some of these courses will be taught by former Principal Jie Zheng, who is coming back to Stuyvesant to help students apply for her for-profit military academy upstate. There, they’ll finally be able to take that one AP that Stuyvesant does not offer: AP Poaching.</p>	Article	158	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
777	﻿Bill Wurtz’s “history of the entire world, i guess” Causes Record-High AP Scores A hopeless sophomore doomed to fail his AP World History exam is enlightened with Bill Wurtz’s immense knowledge and aces it, subsequently resulting in very high scores across the country. <p>A sophomore lay around in a dimly lit room the very night before the AP World History exam. He was panicking because there were less than six hours before the exam, and he had not so much as set his eyes on the first page of the Barron's book.</p><p>His palms were sweaty, his knees were weak, and his arms were heavy. He was gorging on a pint of chocolate ice cream and silently weeping. Throughout this ordeal, he took the time to ponder whether attending college was even necessary.</p><p>Even in his over-the-top emotional state, he was able to multitask like the classic Stuyvesant student: simultaneously looking through his Facebook feed and wiping the endless stream of snot on his face.</p><p>After a bit of scrolling, he saw a new video on the trending tab. Not having anything else to do, besides a bit of online shopping to add to his fidget spinner and male romper collection, he decided to click on the link. In an instant, he was directed to a video by Bill Wurtz titled “history of the entire world, i guess.”</p><p>He felt a flush of relief; Wurtz must have made this video just for the AP World exam. Immediately, he played the video. Sitting through roughly 19 minutes of world history, the video filled his puny mind with enough knowledge for the test. He was sure of it.</p><p>During the exam the next day, he walked in calm and ready. As he quickly advanced through the test, he came upon a tough question: “What came to Buddha’s mind after sitting under a tree for a week?” A lightbulb literally formed above his head to the dismay of many students around him. The answer was obvious: “you could make a religion out of this.” He violently bubbled in that choice, almost ripping the paper and creating a hole as big as the one in his soul.</p><p>He came out of the test feeling confident that he did well. Weeks went by, and soon enough, school was out. As he returned to his dark bedroom to sign up for his 15th AP, he received a notification on his phone saying that AP scores came out. He rushed to check his score, as this would decide whether or not his parents would disown him. To his great delight, he “copped” a five.</p><p>The news that evening reported amazing AP World History exam scores across the country: the highest scores that the College Board had seen in years. It was announced that Wurtz’s video was the source of this success. He had helped write the test and took it upon himself to enlighten the desperate sophomores who needed a last-minute overview of the curriculum.</p><p>The College Board has expressed great delight in Wurtz's teaching abilities, deeming him the “Less-of-a-dub Khan Academy.”</p><p>Wurtz has even recently announced that he will be working on a separate video, exclusively for AP United States History. This announcement was received with a great deal of support and encouragement, yet many complain that they wish Wurtz decided to make it sooner.</p>	Article	159	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
778	﻿The Hitmen End the Season With New Memories The Hitmen have thrived throughout the season and lost in the quarterfinals of playoffs, but have improved their teamwork along the way. <p>The Stuyvesant Hitmen’s second doubles team lobbed the ball over their Bronx Science opponents, who proceeded to smash an overhead at the Hitmen. Senior and co-captain Julian Neuman reacted quickly, hitting a tweener, a between-the-legs shot, for a winner past his opponents. The substitutes and spectators cheered for Stuyvesant as Neuman and senior and co-captain Zachary Wakefield high-fived to celebrate the point. They would go on to lose the match 8-2, but still managed to maintain a high level of energy throughout.</p><p>Tweener winners were not uncommon in Neuman’s matches this season. “[Neuman’s] nickname on the team is J-Tweener due to his prodigious skill for hitting tweeners,” Wakefield said. Neuman was an important asset to the Hitmen this year, bringing with him a 4-2 regular season record in doubles.</p><p>The Hitmen went 7-3 this season, losing only to the schools ranked higher than them in the Bronx/Manhattan A3 League: Beacon and Bronx Science. Their strong finish in the regular season helped them earn the seventh seed in the playoffs. In their first playoff match, they played against New Dorp, and they were able to defeat the school in a swift 5-0 win. The victory propelled the team into quarterfinals.</p><p>The quarterfinals match for the Hitmen was on Friday, May 26th against Bronx Science. Though the rivalry between the two schools had been fierce during the regular season, the Wolverines prevailed easily over the Hitmen, winning with a score of 5-0. At their first meeting this year, the Hitmen had defeated the Wolverines, and the early win had boosted the confidence level of the team. During the playoff game, some of the Hitmen had been expecting a result similar to their first encounter with the Wolverines.  “[The] match was very disappointing; we all went in very optimistically,” Wakefield said. However, the Hitmen did not go down without a fight, as every match had an air of tension around it.</p><p>The first singles match between junior Nicholas Pustilnik and Bronx Science’s Jonah Jurick was particularly competitive. Pustilnik had a 7-2 record from the regular season, while Jurick was just 4-2. Each player held his own service game until Jurick was up 5-4, and managed to break Pustilnik’s serve and rhythm to win the match at 8-4.</p><p>Though the early loss in playoffs was disappointing, the season was very successful for the Hitmen, both against previous rivals and as a team. Many of the seniors held a deep sense of gratitude toward both their coaches and teammates. “I love my team and coach to death and feel very sad that I have to leave this year,” Wakefield said.</p><p>Moving forward, the graduation of seniors on the team this year will be detrimental to the Hitmen’s starting lineup. In order to fill these voids, more of the sophomores and freshmen must step up. “Albert Wan, Robin Han, and Nick Chan were key components of the team and will continue to be for the foreseeable future,” Neuman said. With the potential of these up-and-coming Hitmen, the team will be more successful in the future seasons and playoffs. “I’m hopeful next year the team could compete for championships,” Neuman said.</p><p>“Being a part of Stuy tennis for four years has been a great experience, in particular, our coach, Marv Autry, is a real inspiration to everyone on the team,” said Neuman when asked about the highlights of this season. Overall, the Hitmen are more than satisfied with their performance this year, as players focused more on enjoying the teamwork of the game alongside its competitiveness.</p>	Article	163	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
779	﻿Controversy and Conversations Around the Whitney’s Biennial  <p>Shock. Controversy. Conversations.</p><p>The Whitney Museum of American Art’s latest exhibition, “Whitney Biennial,” can be summed up in just three words, and while they can be used to describe just about any contemporary art show, the biennial makes the ideas conveyed by these words literal. The show, put together every two years, generally spotlights the works of younger, more contemporary artists, with the first biennial occurring in 1973.</p><p>This year, the Whitney targets the biggest issues America faces today—from climate change to wealth inequality to racial tensions—all while showcasing newfound intersections between art and technology, as well as art and activism. The ultimate theme seems to be that nothing is sugarcoated. Every problem is real. Every face is real. It’s time to face reality.</p><p>The controversy of “Open Casket” by Dana Schutz, compared to the praise of “THE TIMES THAY AINT A CHANGING, FAST ENOUGH!” by Henry Taylor speaks volumes. Though similar in subject matter, the two have been received in very different manners.</p><p>“Open Casket” is based on photographs of Emmett Till, who was brutally murdered by two white men, in his coffin in 1955. The photographs were released because his mother wanted to let the world know what had happened to her son. Schutz, as a white painter, is seen as inappropriately appropriating such subject matter, though she does use interesting techniques to represent Till’s disfigured face on a canvas, such as raising the surface on various sections to make the painting three-dimensional. The day after the opening of the biennial, protesters (many of whom are artists) wearing shirts stating “Black Death Spectacle” began standing in front of the piece to block it from being viewed.</p><p>Taylor, a black artist, depicts the shooting of Philando Castile by a police officer in “THE TIMES…” As a color block piece, the painting immediately draws attention, with deep yellow windows contrasting with the dark blue and green car in which Castile lays lifeless, one eye open with specks of paint, not blood, splattered across his white shirt. Interestingly, the mustard yellow windows are like blocks of paint, keeping all that is happening outside the car out of view; only the police officer’s gun in one window and a sliver of the sky in the corner of another window are featured. The Whitney’s mission of highlighting artists that represent a new generation is evident in this particular work, as Taylor’s source was the Facebook live video taken by Castile’s girlfriend. Taylor transforms the event into a visual symbol, using paint to convey the overwhelming chaos and feelings of Castile in the video.</p><p>In the next room, the Whitney explores a related topic in another medium: virtual reality. Viewers are provided a trigger warning and must be over 17 to watch. They are given headphones and virtual-reality goggle sets, are told to grip the railing below, and are closely supervised by staff. The approximately two-minute video, titled “Real Violence,” is of a white man, the artist, Jordan Wolfson, taking a baseball bat and horrifically pounding another white man before dragging the man and graphically kicking his face in. Blood is everywhere, but despite it being set in the bustling city, no one pays attention. However, the viewer, trapped by the goggles and headphones, has no way of ignoring the horrific scene. The video ends as the sound of the man singing Hebrew blessings ends, with the camera shifting unsteadily, like it was all a dream.</p><p>Created with a doll to produce the most realistic content, Wolfson’s work speaks to the charged atmosphere of America today, and because it does not deal with race or social class, it brings light to the bigger problem of violence in America. It shocks and angers viewers who aren’t sure what to expect before becoming suddenly immersed in the scene. The curators’ choice to place the work so closely to the ones dealing with racial tensions, however, gives each piece greater context.</p><p>While the biennial deals greatly with the problems of America today, other works bring more positive messages. Musician Kamasi Washington’s piece, “Harmony of Difference,” in particular, uses film and music to express precisely the opposite, or perhaps a solution, to the problems of America presented by the rest of the show. The work is split into five parts: “Desire,” “Humility,” “Knowledge,” “Perspective,” and “Integrity.” Each part features cuts of all different walks of life interrupted by images of a galaxy, as soothing jazz music builds to become richer and more exciting. The piece does not include the chaos that others in the show are portraying, but instead purposefully focuses on the idea of everyone living in harmony.</p><p>Somehow, all the works curated for the biennial are incredibly topical, though many were chosen before the 2016 presidential election even began, and that fact only proves the necessity of a show that can garner huge audiences while pinpointing the various problems that continue to plague America. The sense of urgency the Whitney Biennial brings, along with the attention generated by its controversies, only proves the effectiveness of activism in art, and it prompts us, as viewers, to wonder what our roles are in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>The “Whitney Biennial” will be on view until June 11, 2017.</p>	Article	183	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
780	﻿States Semifinals Prove Ultimate Stuyvesant’s boys’ ultimate frisbee team laments semifinals loss at States as a tough season ends a three-year streak of being state champions. <p>“We never really believed that we could lose, and then we did,” senior Ely Sandine said. As co-captain of Stuyvesant’s boys’ ultimate frisbee team, the Sticky Fingers, Sandine was as devastated as anyone after the team’s semifinals exit in the State Championship. After winning four games, Stuyvesant faced Ethical Culture Fieldston School and played intensely in its last chance of making it to the finals.</p><p>After a rocky season and a postseason battle, the loss did not come easily to the team, which is used to repeated success. “We were coming off of three consecutive state championships, and as a result, we were expected to win this year,” Sandine said. The bar was set high for the Sticky Fingers, and as Sandine expressed, the boys simply could not perform under this pressure.</p><p>The year started off with the Youth Ultimate League of Arlington (YULA) tournament, which gathered the top teams from around the East Coast. Stuyvesant only managed to tally one win during the entire weekend, which, though disappointing, did not come as a complete surprise given the seriously tough competition. In Stuyvesant’s first match, it faced Yorktown High School—which was recently ranked 24th in the nation by the reputable High School Power Rankings—and ended the first half ahead of Yorktown 7-6. The Sticky Fingers ended up losing that match, but held their own against an elite squad.</p><p>A week later, Stuyvesant was set to play The Brooklyn Latin School. Despite the defeats in the YULA outing, the Sticky Fingers were confident, and perhaps unwisely played as if the game was a guaranteed victory. “We expected to win the game easily, and as a result played carelessly,” Sandine said. The team lacked sound fundamentals, turning over the disc on short passes and letting these small mistakes get to their heads.</p><p>This first upset set the tone for the rest of the season, and it seemed the Sticky Fingers had lost the dominance that previously defined them. After more ups and downs, Stuyvesant prepared for the City Championship that was on the near horizon. In a close semifinals showdown, the Sticky Fingers crawled to a one point victory over Fieldston. The win seemed to come as a surprise, but it earned them a shot at the City title nonetheless. “[We had] a lot of lucky plays, and we did not play our best,” senior Benjamin Zhang said.</p><p>Due to play Bard High School in the finals, Stuyvesant came mentally prepared and brought the intensity up a notch. The stronger gameplay was met with Bard’s strong lineup, and though the Sticky Fingers were able to keep it close, once Bard got ahead of them, they simply could not catch up. This loss was Stuyvesant’s third against Bard, after playing them twice during the season and falling short by one point both times.</p><p>By the time the State Championship arrived, the Sticky Fingers were motivated to continue the legacy that had been left by three graduating classes and take the title. Stuyvesant cruised by the first four games, beating Mamaroneck High School 13-1, New Rochelle High School 13-1, Brooklyn Latin 13-5, and Bronx High School of Science 13-5. After their quarterfinals victory over Bronx Science, the Sticky Fingers had less than an hour until they played Fieldston in the semifinals. Despite a strong first four games, semifinals proved to be a turning point in the tournament. “That's when everything went south,” Zhang said.</p><p>Fieldston took the first half 7-0, shutting down any signs of Stuyvesant offense. Additionally, the Sticky Fingers’ defense relented, allowing the opposition to score. “We weren’t putting enough pressure on them after we gave up the disc,” Sandine said. In the second half, the Sticky Fingers were clinging to any hope of staying in the game. In their desperation, they scored five points before eventually succumbing to Fieldston.</p><p>Though the season’s end was crushing, some looked back on the year with satisfaction. Senior Jacob Grunebaum highlighted the great pressure that is put on the frisbee team. He explained that the expectation to win is a burden that affects the team’s game and takes away from focusing on the basics. Grunebaum was content with the team’s performance, and believes it should be proud of what it accomplished. “I think we achieved a very high level of playing and proved that we are a very good team, just that consistency ultimately was our greatest problem,” he said.</p><p>Though the Sticky Fingers will lose many strong players next year, they will continue to work hard for the title, learning from the mistakes made this year and keeping their heads up. This loss could humble Stuyvesant and change the dynamic next season. “It has been a while since we played as the underdogs,” Sandine said.</p>	Article	162	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
790	﻿New Arts and Theater Clubs Rise At Stuyvesant A review and investigation of several rising student-run clubs and publications at Stuy and what they are creating for the Stuyvesant community within the context of our school’s reputation for being STEM-oriented. <p>I know from personal experience that when people think of Stuyvesant, they tend to have a very limited view of what our school represents.</p><p>Many, if not all, of us can recall telling a friend that we’ve decided to attend Stuyvesant and finding ourselves thrown into a conversation about how it’s a pressure cooker of misery and how we will never be able to balance our social lives with our academics.</p><p>However, any Stuyvesant student knows that as focused as we all are on our grades and schoolwork, many have an artistic side too. In fact, our school has a long history of producing remarkable art, writing, music, and theater, from STC and SING!, to our literary magazine, Caliper, and our school newspaper, The Spectator.</p><p>I reached out to a few of the students leading new artistic clubs and publications so that I could share with the Stuyvesant community just what these groups have to offer and capture the essence of the artistic side of a school that is famous for being STEM-oriented.</p><p>Earlier in this school year, freshman Andrew Ng founded a literary magazine called The Acacia. Though it publishes many types of media, The Acacia focuses on engaging students who love writing. “Acacia is made up of mostly freshmen, so it is easier for everyone to bond and be friends,” freshman Fawziyah Khan said.</p><p>Because of its large freshman membership, Acacia may be a model of the future of Stuyvesant. It provides the newest generation of students with their own outlet.</p><p>“I got [the] idea to found my pub because I wanted to give students a special medium to express themselves through writing,” Ng explained. “ I personally love writing, and I wanted to give that level of empowerment to everybody else.”</p><p>Ng isn’t the only student trying to create artistic spaces to help his peers express themselves. The Stuyvesant Broadcasting Community (SBC) is one of the more ambitious new clubs this year. “It's mainly intended to broadcast things like news, music, videos/audio we might record. We also display art and write stories,”  junior and SBC President Alexandra Wen said. They are pioneering a new medium for students to express themselves. Wen is optimistic about their club’s potential, saying, “I can easily see us doing well, being able to prepare for future projects, and having everything organized.”</p><p>Freshman and SBC Vice President Chris Brown, who will be inheriting Wen’s position of president next year, said, “One idea we had was a talk show or interview show where we could invite students or teachers to be featured.”</p><p>Chances are you saw the red posters with the word “RIOT!” on them hanging from walls and escalators all over the school building earlier this year. RIOT stands for Rampage of Imagination and Original Theater, and this new theater company has some of Stuyvesant’s best theater writers and creators on board. Sophomore, Co-founder, and Vice President Noelle Gloria said, “RIOT! is a script writing club, so we intend for our members to produce skits or short plays to perform at SOS, and, when RIOT! grows bigger and more established, we even hope to hold our own showcase.”</p><p>The relaxed and creative atmosphere of the club is part of what makes it so special. Freshman Matthew Carlson says, “There isn't such a thing as a typical RIOT! Meeting.”</p><p>Yet it still has big goals for its members, and each meeting has a purpose that its members are always motivated to execute together.</p><p>The creative spirit of RIOT! defies every stereotype and false expectation surrounding Stuyvesant. A student theater company opposes that common belief that all the students are dedicated only to math and science. “In improv, you really have to think on your feet, which is something that many don't associate with STEM subjects. Also, the creativity is definitely something that defies the STEM stereotype. It's a good thing in improv to take a creative approach to the prompt, your character, or the scene in general,” Carlson said.</p><p>Sophomores Elena Sapelyuk and Klaire Geller also created Stuyvesant Fine Arts, a chapter of the National Art Honors Society. It is run much like Stuyvesant’s Red Cross, with hour requirements for certification.</p><p>“I realized that there wasn't really a place for people at Stuy[vesant] to create art. Our school is so focused on STEM subjects and academics, many people who are artistically inclined feel guilty for taking time out of their schedule to express themselves,” Sapelyuk said. “I wanted to create a space where everyone can create as well as collaborate and give back to the community. [We] paint a flower or laugh while collaborating on a project.”</p><p>The purpose of this club is a combination of creating visual art itself and volunteering. Each club meeting has a theme or a lesson. They even travel to the Brookdale Senior Center on a monthly basis to provide watercolor classes, and they hope to work on large mural projects around the school building.</p><p>“The elders really show their joy being with us. They make us feel comfortable with our environment. Through the few volunteering experiences, I have made friends with a 101-year-old and an Asian-American elder,” said sophomore Kate Shen in an e-mail interview. “The 101-year-old show[ed] so much happiness when she completed her first painting, saying she is going to show her son her accomplishment. The Asian-American elder started to talk to me about her children and her life stories.”</p><p>Freshman Sara Stebbin and the members of her new club “Stuycatto” approach art through the medium of song.</p><p>“Music composition is something I love and am  passionate about, but I never really had a group of friends who shared that interest,” Stebbins said.</p><p>While the music created by the members ranges from classical to contemporary, Stuycatto is as much a uniting force for teenage musicians as Stuyvesant is for ambitious students who are pursuing various types of careers. “The Stuyccato community is a friendly one, so sharing music is always encouraged,” junior Jason Lee said. “I enjoy the positive feedback and criticism that I'm given because it pushes me to improve my music. Honestly, when I want to share anything, I can always turn to the people in Stuyccato.”</p><p>The formation of clubs like these within our community reflect an evolving environment at Stuyvesant. Young artists are making a place for themselves and their creation, and forging a path for all students to pursue a more well-rounded education. These people are intelligent and hard-working, while also being creative. It just goes to show: Stuyvesant is not only a place for STEM-centric students.</p>	Article	174	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
791	﻿Stuy Afloat on the Sea of Numbers The importance of success is overemphasized in Stuyvesant’s mentality and has become toxic, thus leading to a dismissal of mental health when the issues should instead be gaining attention. <p>A social life, good grades, and enough sleep—choose wisely, because you can only pick two. The ideal Stuyvesant student has perfect grades, great extracurriculars, and great potential—that includes the great potential of developing mental health issues. Outside of the classroom, it’s more common to hear “I’m going to kill myself” or “Please push me off of a building” followed by laughter, rather than “I’m gonna take a break.”</p><p>Our parents, our teachers, and even our peers talk about how we’re supposed to be the best and the brightest, how we’re supposed to be leading the nation to great things someday. We knew the rigorous academic setting we were getting into. But why does that mean we “don’t get to complain”?</p><p>To my parents, my Stuyvesant experience is nothing more than a number. When I (Marie) get home, I’m not met with, “Did you learn anything interesting today?” Instead, my parents ask me whether I got any grades back or what tests I have coming up.</p><p>They expect me to get good grades, and if I don’t meet their expectations, I am lectured about how I’m not going to get into a “good” college. Even after countless mental breakdowns about grades, there’s no room to complain because as a Stuy student, I’m expected to deal with it. After all, Stuyvesant is a place where the ends justify the means: as long as you get into a good college, your experience here doesn’t matter.</p><p>With 3,350 students in a 10-floor building, the competition is immense and the pressure to succeed can make or break you. It’s the prime example of a “sink-or-swim” environment, and most students seem to float around during their four years.</p><p>Unfortunately, a large number of students “sink,” especially with this year’s increase in mental health-related hospitalizations. What if the notion of the “perfect Stuy kid” just doesn’t exist and we are all just sinking ships? Do some of us just take longer to drown?</p><p>I (Alex) cannot, using both hands, count the amount of times that I’ve drowned. During freshman year, suicidal ideations intruded my daily thoughts. During sophomore year, anxiety attacks were so common that at my low points, they felt more like sinking than shaking.</p><p>Instead of being proud of one’s well-being, many Stuy students take pride in the exact things that cause many mental health problems: numbers. The numbers mean everything, from the amount of likes on a profile picture to the grades that colleges see. And we, as students who grew up thinking that numbers were worth more than us, use that exact system to rank ourselves too. Before we even got into this school, we were already a statistic. On the SHSAT, a test with a simple cut-off score, you either get in or you don’t.</p><p>At Stuy, college admissions dominate everything. Some students create clubs for the sole purpose of making themselves look good, and others go to clubs that seem “scholarly.” The option of doing something because it makes you happy rather than because it makes you look good for college is uncommon.</p><p>The students who do create or go to clubs that aren’t geared toward adding that extra touch on their college application are commonly questioned about their intentions. Why’d you make it? What college are you trying to impress? It’s almost like finding rare birds, but they’re only rare because they’ve been driven to near extinction.</p><p>We have been questioned about the creation of Stuy Limitless, a club we made for both the purpose of helping people with their self-confidence and for helping ourselves along the road of recovery from mental illnesses. The joke “Did you make this for college?” isn’t funny when you realize that other students genuinely believe this. That shakes us to the core—to realize that an environment that cultivates learning is the same one that cannot see past numbers.</p><p>But, no one is born with a superiority complex. No one pops out of the womb screaming, “I’m better than you for having one more point on my exam!” People claim that this is just the “Stuy attitude,” but, by doing that, they’re only dismissing the problem instead of facing it. How many Stuy students have to drown before we actually address this issue?</p><p>Luckily, as junior year comes to a close, I (Alex) have recovered. I’ve used my resources when I’ve hit my low points this year; I’ve gone to guidance and to the nurse. Resources are available to us, such as the SPARK program’s free, confidential counseling.</p><p>The administration has started to change their mentality, with guidance department meetings starting to focus more on mental health and the effects of stress, and presentations focusing on teaching freshmen how to cope effectively with it. But, there’s only so much they can do to solve the problem if the main issue is ourselves.</p><p>Most of us expect our peers, teachers, and parents to be able to see that we are drowning. We expect them to throw a life jacket to save us, but everyone is in their own bubble. Rather than waiting for other people to notice that we are struggling, we need to take action for ourselves and actively seek help.</p><p>We need to stop being stone walls, with our mental health resources bouncing off of us like rubber balls. As students, we need to start reaching out more instead of waiting for others to come to us. One cannot fix a problem without first recognizing it—so we, the student body, now need to change before our own foundation falls out from under us.</p>	Article	175	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
792	﻿An Obligation to Strangers Given that a couple thousand dollars can save someone’s life if given to the right charity, people who are financially capable have an obligation to allocate some of their resources to help people abroad. <p>Suppose one day you’re walking alongside a shallow pond when you notice a child has fallen in and appears to be drowning. You run to where the child is, but just when you’re about to pull the child out of the water, you remember that you are on your way to an important event and you’re dressed in your most expensive outfit. Do you have an obligation to save the child, despite the risk of ruining your pricey clothing?</p><p>To this, nearly everyone would say yes. The material worth of clothing is meaningless when compared to the value of a human life; clothing is replaceable, but a person’s life is not.</p><p>Now, let’s add some caveats to this thought experiment. Imagine there are several other people standing around the pond, but they refuse to help the child. Do you still jump in even though other people won’t? Of course. The inaction of others doesn't mean it's okay to let the child drown. Now, imagine the child drowning lived in a different state than you. Again, most would argue that factors like location or nationality do not change the value of one’s life, and thus we are still morally obliged to save the child’s life.</p><p>According to philosopher Peter Singer in his book “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” at every moment, we are all choosing to neglect the drowning child and give up on moral duties. By choosing to spend money on material luxuries instead of donating to effective charities that help those in extreme poverty or on the verge of death, we are in effect choosing our expensive clothing over another person’s life. We have already established that the location and nationality of the child, as well as the inaction of others, are all morally irrelevant in our obligation to save someone’s life. If this is the case, then very little separates our hypothetical obligation to the drowning child from our actual obligation to children in abject poverty abroad.</p><p>One could argue that saving a life in the real world is not as simple as lifting a child out of a pond. In reality, though, there has never before been a time in history when it has been so easy to save someone’s life. Controlled studies of humanitarian efforts allow experts to identify which charities are the most effective at saving lives. According to William Macaskill of Oxford University in his book “Doing Good Better,” some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others, meaning they can save a life for a fraction of the cost. GiveWell, an organization that scrutinizes the efficacy of charitable practices, has selected a handful of charities that are particularly outstanding.</p><p>The Against Malaria Foundation, for instance, provides long-lasting insecticide-laced bed nets to children in Sub-Saharan Africa for $2.50 per treatment. With every $3,300 in donations, the Against Malaria Foundation is able to save one life. Another charity, Deworm the World, provides pills that rid children in Kenya and India of parasitic intestinal worms at a cost of only 55 cents per treatment. The World Health Organization finds that 880 million children worldwide suffer from parasitic worms, an often overlooked global health problem. Though usually not life-threatening, parasitic worms are a cause of immense suffering, and have been shown to significantly reduce school attendance.</p><p>If your financial situation prohibits you from putting aside money to donate to effective charities, then it is difficult to maintain the argument that you would be obliged to donate. However, if you believe that you do have some wiggle room in your daily expenditures, even small alterations could have a huge impact. Something as simple as switching from Chipotle to halal could save you $5.00, which could in turn provide either two bed nets or 10 deworming pills to those in need, and packing your lunch at home and taking it to school could do even more.</p><p>At very little cost to our material well-being, we can have a superhero-like effect on the world by letting an 80-year-old blind man see for the first time through a cataracts operation, or even preventing a mother in Ghana from having the grief and sorrow of losing a child to infectious disease. If you are willing to sacrifice your expensive clothing for the drowning child, then you should be willing to switch from Chipotle to halal or forgo another pair of shoes and donate money to where it will mean a lot more. If you really agree with this, back it up with action—the world will thank you.</p>	Article	176	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
793	﻿Changes On the Horizon for the Big Sib Program: Good or Bad? Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names. What it does require is initiative on the part of Big Sibs to introduce themselves and make legitimate connections. <p>Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names. What it does require is initiative on the part of Big Sibs to introduce themselves and make legitimate connections.</p><p>Focus Sentence: Summarize the focus of the story in one sentence</p><p>“We have for years referred to them as mini-counselors. They are the ones getting to see the freshmen and the transfer sophomore students the most in the beginning, and are the most tuned-in to how they are doing in their transition,” Assistant Principal of Guidance Casey Pedrick said.</p><p>Even so, the guidance office has decided to play a larger role in Stuyvesant’s Big Sib program in the hope of improving its organization and effectiveness. In the past, the Big Sib program was completely student-run, from the application process and selection to homeroom management and Big Sib accountability.</p><p>Applications were not standardized and were based heavily on the Big Sib Chairs’ personal judgments, while attendance records were rarely kept for homerooms. As a result, the program seemed to be more oriented toward the privilege of being a Big Sib, rather than offering support systems to incoming students.</p><p>Of the Little Sibs surveyed, 48.9 percent reported knowing all of their Big Sibs’ names. This is certainly a mark of success, but it also means a slight majority of Little Sibs did not know their Big Sibs’ names. Five upperclassmen are entrusted with the responsibility to mentor 30 freshmen through Stuyvesant, and it does not require a large impression to be made in order to remember so few names. What it does require is initiative on the part of Big Sibs to introduce themselves and make legitimate connections.</p><p>At its core, these problems stem from an issue with the highly subjective selection of Big Sibs. “There are some people who either should not be Big Sibs or just don’t do their jobs as Big Sibs,” Big Sib Chair Kevin Li said. Also surrounding the program is the stigma of nepotism.</p><p>To alleviate these problems, the guidance office has revamped the selection process by adding an anonymous first stage with a rubric. “In the beginning, [the Big Sib Chairs] are giving points to things in different areas [based on] the rubric. None of that was ever done before. It was just them reviewing it on paper, taking their little notes, having the interviews. At least now you have an anonymous review with a rubric you are following,” Pedrick said.</p><p>A concern with a rubric-based application, however, is that it focuses too much on academic performance. It is important to have students with a variety of perspectives and achievement levels in the program.</p><p>In some instances, the rubric appears to be almost an afterthought—interviews, for instance, began before an interview rubric was finalized. This system was created in order to provide students with a concrete idea of why they may not have been accepted into the program, yet it should not exist simply to cover that base.</p><p>It is important to strike a balance between transparency and avoiding robotic selections. One important step that has been taken is lowering the grade requirement for Big Sib applicants from an 88 to an 85 and being more strict about maintaining this baseline; the new cut-off will allow more students to be eligible while also standardizing the process.</p><p>Many upperclassmen, once selected for the program, also find that there is no incentive to be an active participant; even with homeroom leaders, some freshmen homerooms are devoid of Big Sibs. “We’ll hear from teachers that no Big Sibs came to homeroom today or only three come consistently,” Pedrick said.</p><p>Under the restructured program, Big Sib Chairs will no longer be assigned to a specific homeroom. Instead, they will each oversee a batch of homerooms and provide direct guidance to homeroom leaders. Additionally, homeroom teachers may be asked to report any Big Sib absences to the guidance office.</p><p>Both the guidance office and the Big Sib Chairs recognize that Little Sibs often face issues that are beyond the scope of another student. In these instances it is important that the Big Sibs have a close connection with their Little Sibs’ guidance counselors so that they can pass on any larger issues. To promote this, most Little Sib homerooms will have at least one Big Sib who shares their guidance counselor.</p><p>To ensure that freshmen foster a relationship with their guidance counselor, instead of giving a generic introduction to their entire homeroom during Camp Stuy, counselors will hold smaller meetings in the hallway. “We want the guidance counselors to not only [...] go to each homeroom and talk [at Camp Stuy,] but to talk to specific kids in homeroom. For example, pull out two or three [students] at a time to really introduce themselves and make themselves approachable,” Li said.</p><p>Camp Stuy, along with the Big Sib Little Sib Dance, is part of the frenzy of activity that the Big Sib Program opens up with each year. But by the end of the first marking period, apathy seeps into the program. To combat this, the new Big Sib Chairs are planning to hold events outside of school throughout the year.</p><p>“Homeroom is only once every two weeks generally for 15 minutes. We’re going to try to maximize the opportunities we have face to face with our Little Sibs. I know some homerooms [already] have little bubble tea meetups and things like that. [Now,] not only one homeroom is doing it, but all homerooms are doing it,” Big Sib Chair Charlotte Ruhl said.</p><p>However, a more effective way for Big Sibs and Little Sibs to bond would be through weekly, rather than sporadic, homerooms, which both would be required to attend. Homerooms should not only be a time to hand out forms, but a place for students to interact. In the past, Big Sib Chairs have spoken with faculty about having more frequent homerooms, but they have not been cooperative in helping underclassmen assimilate.</p><p>The guidance office’s involvement in restructuring the program has obvious benefits, but historically the Big Sib program has been entirely student-run. This autonomy is part of what makes Stuyvesant a unique school, and student-based leadership makes Big Sibs truly welcoming and inspiring. We hope the Big Sib Chairs continue to be the driving force behind the program.</p>	Article	177	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
794	﻿“Thirteen Reasons Why”… Or Why Not: A Point/Counterpoint  <p>Based on Jay Asher’s novel published in 2007, Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why,” aired on March 31, 2017, emphasizes how serious teenage bullying and suicide can be. Viewers follow Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette), a junior attending Liberty High School, as he listens to the 13 cassette tapes Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford) left before she took her own life. She dedicates each tape to a different person who drove her closer to her decision to commit suicide. On the tapes, she recalls instances of sexual harassment, rape, slut-shaming, and vicious rumors.</p><p>The anti-bullying message behind “Thirteen Reasons Why” is prominent and powerful, but the way it is presented is controversial. Some believe that the series glorifies suicide, presenting it as an ‘easy way out’ to teenagers going through troubles similar to Hannah’s. So, is “Thirteen Reasons Why” a revolutionary, powerful show, or is the backlash well-deserved?</p><p><b>Point: Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why” adeptly tackles the subject of suicide and makes for a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece.</b></p><p>There was a lot of buzz when Netflix released season one of “Thirteen Reasons Why.” With American actress and singer Selena Gomez as its producer, it's not surprising that so many people were excited to watch the series. The series has much more than a famous celebrity producer, however. “Thirteen Reasons Why” tells the riveting, tragic story of Hannah Baker by walking us through the cassette tapes she left behind as an explanation for her suicide.</p><p>While suicide is a heavy subject, the plot of “Thirteen Reasons Why” weaves in Hannah Baker’s star-crossed lover to lighten the plot. It was a smart decision on the part of the writers and directors to focus more on this relationship than Hannah's suicide. Had “Thirteen Reasons Why” been solely about Hannah’s suicide, it would have been too dark for most audiences to stomach.</p><p>Clay’s presence gives viewers something to hold onto and root for throughout the show, which may have kept them watching despite the graphic and upsetting scenes. Clay’s heartbreak may also have an impact on viewers who may be having thoughts of suicide because it shows the impact suicide can have on loved ones. Many people contemplating suicide believe that the world would be better off without them, and Clay’s regret over failing to tell Hannah he loves her while she was still alive may give people hope that they do mean something to someone.</p><p>There is a lot of uproar over the graphic scenes in the series, especially the scene of Hannah Baker’s suicide. Some believe that since these scenes can be triggering and should not have been included. However, a trigger warning is included at the beginning of each episode that contains a graphic scene, with a brief description of what exactly may be triggering. Those who continue watching do so at their own discretion.</p><p>In addition, the graphic portrayal of Hannah’s suicide, including her mother’s initial reaction to finding her body, conveys a more powerful message because it emanates the permanence of suicide and the effect it can have on loved ones.</p><p>When Hannah seeks help from her school guidance counselor, Mr. Porter (Derek Luke), he dismisses her problems and does not offer any substantial emotional support. People criticize this depiction of Mr. Porter and believe it to be unfair, but it is true to reality. People contemplating suicide usually do seek some sort of help; according to Mental Health America, 64 percent of people who attempt suicide visit a doctor the month before their attempt.</p><p>This reality will allow schools and health professionals to expand the resources available to teenagers with depression or suicidal thoughts. As screenwriter Nic Sheff puts it, “Facing these issues head-on—talking about them, being open about them—will always be our best defense against losing another life.”</p><p>The message behind “Thirteen Reasons Why” goes beyond a simple “don’t bully.” It sheds light on the harm bystanders can cause. There were many instances of bystanders in the series. For example, Hannah and Justin Foley (Brandon Flynn) stayed silent while Bryce Walker (Justin Prentice) raped Jessica Davis (Alisha Boe) at a party. Clay didn’t say anything when the slut-shaming rumors of Hannah spread around the school.</p><p>The truth is, silence is just as harmful as bullying; if you’re not against the bully, you’re often complicit.</p><p><b>Counterpoint: Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why” treats the subjects of mental illness and suicide irresponsibly, destroying all of the show’s potential.</b></p><p>There is no argument that “Thirteen Reasons Why” does not bring attention to suicide; however, this attention may cause more harm than good. There is a reason why suicide awareness groups across the nation have expressed concerns about the show.</p><p>There are many problems with the show—the biggest one being the lack of attention on mental disorders and illnesses. Whether the directors or writers of the show avoided the subject of mental illness on purpose or not, it comes off as careless and irresponsible for them to miss such a prominent factor in Hannah’s downfall.</p><p>Furthermore, “Thirteen Reasons Why” idealizes and glorifies suicide. As Dan Reidenberg, the executive director for Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE), says, “Young people are going to over-identify with Hannah in the series, and we actually may see more suicides as a result of this.”</p><p>The show depicts Hannah committing suicide as a form of revenge, since the series shows her leaving the tapes behind for the people who hurt her to show them what they did to her. This is detrimental and undermining to people who struggle from suicidal urges, as entertainment journal “The Edge” notes, “It perpetuates a ‘suicide as revenge’ mentality, a message of getting justice against everyone who wronged her.”</p><p>I’m not one to victim-blame because it is certain that Hannah has had an impossibly rough time from her peers that she blames in her tapes, but the show almost vilifies her. The tapes she records explaining why she killed herself will make viewers question exactly why she chose to do that.</p><p>There are many graphic scenes in the show which can trigger people who have had similar experiences or have thought about doing the things Hannah has done. Though some people favor these scenes because they’re realistic, they almost seem like a how-to guide to suicide when the show explicitly shows how Hannah takes her own life.</p><p>A Stuyvesant junior who would prefer to be left anonymous feels strongly about these graphic scenes. When asked about her experience watching said scenes, she said, “[I have suffered from having suicidal thoughts] for most of middle school up until the end of sophomore year. [The show] deals with really dark subject matter and visualizes the very dark thoughts I’ve been working on and off therapy to repress; for instance, in Hannah’s bathtub scene, [I had] the exact thought and [seeing] it on screen prompted a panic attack.” She agrees that it is important for the show to expose teenagers to this topic, but the way it is portrayed isn’t actually providing anything for youth suicide prevention. Instead, it may cause a potential relapse.</p><p>Unlike the novel, the Netflix original is anything but sophisticated. While the 288-page book has depth and truthfully depicts belligerent school environments and teenage anxiety, the show stretches the plot line across 13 one-hour long episodes so much that the meaning becomes lost. Instead of focusing on Hannah and her mental health, the plot focuses more on the relationship between her and Clay. This relationship is stretched so thin that it becomes flimsy and transparent.</p><p>The writers and directors of “Thirteen Reasons Why” claim that its purpose is to prevent teenage suicide and show those who are struggling that there are people out there who can help. However, the show does nothing to elaborate more on that. Hannah does not talk to a professional until the last episode, where he dismisses her and doesn’t suggest any treatment at all. She also does not talk to her parents, which is common for many who are suffering from suicidal thoughts.</p><p>If this series is really supposed to show that it’s okay to talk about one’s said thoughts, Hannah should have done this to possibly influence many others who are watching. The poor image of adults in helping Hannah is damaging and enforces the idea that they don’t understand and won’t ever listen to a suicidal teenager’s thoughts. We see her loved ones failing to help her, which ultimately leads to her decision to take her own life.</p><p>Netflix’s “Thirteen Reasons Why” has good intentions, but it comes off as irresponsible and hurtful. Maybe if the directors had depicted mental illnesses more realistically, the series would have had a different outcome.</p>	Article	178	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
795	﻿“Dear Evan Hansen” Conveys A Powerful And Modern Message  <p>When hearing the words “musical theater,” “Dear Evan Hansen” isn’t what would typically come to mind. In an industry that is usually associated with tap dancing and extravagant musical numbers, the show tells a poignant and unique story that touches on subjects such as bullying, suicide, and mental illness, having audiences crying 20 minutes into the first act. The production lets viewers laugh, sob, and learn that many others face similar struggles.</p><p>The musical, directed by Michael Greif, centers around 17-year-old outsider Evan Hansen (Ben Platt), who suffers from social anxiety and is advised by his therapist to write letters to himself in order to improve his confidence. Evan prints out a letter at school, which is spotted by Connor Murphy (Mike Faist), Evan’s tormenter and equally alienated classmate, who takes the letter home after mockingly signing the cast on Evan’s arm.</p><p>Evan returns to school to be informed by Connor’s parents that, shortly after their interaction, Connor committed suicide with Evan’s letter in his pocket. With the note giving Connor’s parents the false belief that Evan was one of their son’s only friends, Evan is integrated into the Murphy family and begins to form a relationship with Connor’s sister, Zoe, whom he has long admired.</p><p>Composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul tell the show’s story through songs that illustrate Evan’s thought process when interacting with others, his relationship with his frequently absent mother, and the shock of Evan and those around him when it is revealed that Evan was not close with Connor. The songs narrate every event, from Evan nervously making up a story about time he spent with Connor to Evan finally realizing that he doesn’t have to put up a front to be accepted. The pop-rock style of the show’s score differs from classic show tunes, yet exhibits the emotions of high school students and their families in an honest and thought-provoking way.</p><p>“Waving Through A Window,” one of the show’s more well-known songs, describes how Evan is affected by social anxiety with lines such as “Give them no reason to stare / No slipping up if you slip away / So I’ve got nothing to share / No, I’ve got nothing to say” that narrate how Evan goes about his day-to-day life.</p><p>The musical’s songs range from upbeat and catchy, like “Sincerely, Me,” to more lyrical and truthful, as in “Words Fail,” in which Evan tries to explain to Connor’s parents the reasons behind him letting them believe that he and Connor were friends. The well-written lyrics were accompanied by strong singing and music that stuck with viewers throughout the performance. Judging by the amount of tears at intermission, the score definitely struck a chord with the audience.</p><p>The powerful message in “Dear Evan Hansen” is communicated not only by musical numbers, but by believable and passionate acting. Ben Platt hit the nail on the head with every aspect of his portrayal of Evan Hansen, down to the blinking and fluttering that accompany Evan’s anxiety.</p><p>Platt, with Laura Dreyfuss’s quirky yet charming take on Zoe, make for a believable couple that the audience could relate to. Rachel Bay Jones is perfectly fit for the role of Evan’s mother, starting out the show by doting and being supportive in “Anybody Have A Map?” and revealing the genuine and straightforward side of her in “So Big/So Small.”</p><p>Kristolyn Lloyd provides comic relief as the dedicated and studious Alana, Connor’s self-proclaimed “closest acquaintance,” and co-president of the “Connor Project,” an organization centered around remembering Connor and essentially convincing Connor’s parents that Evan cares about their son.</p><p>The rest of the cast’s performances, such as Jennifer Laura Thompson and John Dossett as Connor’s parents, Will Roland as Evan’s sarcastic family friend, and Mike Faist as Connor, help tie the musical together by creating a varied range of characters that make the show feel believable.</p><p>“Dear Evan Hansen” is also endearing through its visual aspects. The cast moves on and offstage on set pieces that allow for smooth transitions. The stage’s backdrop was a set of screens that reflected the plot and highlighted different aspects of the performance. As the “Connor Project” gains an internet presence, the set flashes images of social media profiles and comments praising Evan and Alana’s work.</p><p>With social networking being such a huge aspect of our culture today, it’s refreshing to see a show that revolves so heavily around interactions on the internet. These images also change to correspond with Evan’s emotions at different points in the show. This gives another dimension to the performance, helps the audience follow along with the plot, and punctuates significant scenes. During “Waving Through A Window,” texts and pictures flash by quickly to convey desperation and urgency.</p><p>What attracts so many people to the production is how viewers can see themselves onstage. The musical sheds light on issues such as suicide, dysfunctional family relationships, and mental illnesses that are extremely prevalent in today’s society, but are also often misrepresented.</p><p>Most people have probably felt like outsiders at some point in time, especially in high school. By adding details such as Evan taking medication for his anxiety and Connor not being able to form a relationship with his parents, the show stays true to reality and allows the audience members to feel as if their own stories are being told.</p><p>The show reaches out to audiences by reminding us that no one deserves to be forgotten, and you are not alone. While the most of the characters in the show are high school students, audiences will be able to see themselves in “Dear Evan Hansen,” regardless of age.</p>	Article	179	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
796	﻿A Stuy Student’s Guide to Springtime Flicks  <p>Whether you're planning a movie day with friends or just looking for a movie to watch, here’s a list of some spring-time flicks you may want to check out before they’re off the big screen.</p><p>Spring is the beginning of blockbuster season, but it’s also known as the time of the year when mediocre movies are put on the big screens, expected to come in and out of theaters without much attention. Despite the spring season usually lacking any Oscar-worthy releases, it’s still important to know what’s available to watch, no matter what the season; and who knows, maybe an Oscar film managed to sneak its way into a May release date. With that in mind, here are nine movies, ranging from blockbusters to slight obscurities, that you may want to go check out during the warm months before the summer rolls in!</p><p><b>Beauty and the Beast</b></p><p><i>March 17, 2017</i></p><p>This was perhaps one of the most anticipated spring-season flicks of this year: a real-life adaptation of the Disney animated movie “Beauty and the Beast” (1991), one of three animated films in history to have been nominated for Best Picture. This new adaptation stars Emma Watson as the widely-admired Disney bookworm, Belle. It has been praised for its beautiful set and costume design, having brought to life Belle’s famous yellow ballroom gown, as well as the grandiose character design of each of the objects. Though it came out almost two months ago, tickets are still being sold, so I recommend you catch it in theaters before it leaves the big screen for good.</p><p><b>Gifted</b></p><p><i>April 7, 2017</i></p><p>This movie is about a little girl with a brain all Stuyvesant students wish they had. An unparalleled genius in mathematics, “Gifted” follows the tug-of-war battle for a young girl’s life between her down-to-Earth uncle (Chris Evans) and his incredibly ambitious mother (Lindsay Duncan). Most people know Chris Evans as the honorable Avengers leader, Captain America, so watching him take on this vulnerable, average human role should be a nice change of pace for most viewers.</p><p><b>Fate of the Furious</b></p><p><i>April 14, 2017</i></p><p>The Fast and Furious movies are famous for their over-the-top car chases, with each scene in each new movie release crazier than the last. However, these movies are also heavily built on the family-like connections each of the characters have with one another. It’s a combination of the closeness between the characters and their unquenchable hunger for driving cars that causes them to get stuck in a situation crazier than the last. Though I don’t have high expectations for this movie ( car chases can only get so crazy before they become too painfully unrealistic to watch), if you find joy in watching the insanely impossible occur on-screen, go get yourself a ticket for this flick.</p><p><b>Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer</b></p><p><i>April 14, 2017</i></p><p>Sometimes, the most obscure movie can be the one most packed with surprises; after all, what expectations could you have for something you’ve never heard of? With this springtime indie film comes Richard Gere, a man famous for his role as a classy rich boy in the ‘90s film “Pretty Woman,” playing Norman, a devious middleman who’s made a living as a forgettable fixer. When Norman makes arrangements with someone on the rise to fame, the world begins to learn his name, and knowledge of his existence and schemes soon rise with his unwanted popularity, threatening the life he’s lived comfortably for so long. If you’re looking to get away from the Hollywood blockbuster and trying something out of the norm, why not go and give this flick a try?</p><p><b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</b></p><p><i>May 5, 2017</i></p><p>“Guardians of the Galaxy” was one of Marvel’s most highly regarded films, with a music score unrivaled by any action movie before it. Three years after this movie was first released, Marvel fans can rush back to the cinemas to watch Star-Lord, Gamora, Draxx, Rocket Racoon, and everyone’s favorite baby tree, Groot, go on another crazy adventure across the galaxy, but not without some sweet new tunes to accompany them! If you plan to go and watch this film, get ready to see some new faces and old rivals join the Guardian squad, alongside a highly-anticipated character reveal that everyone who’s seen the original film has been waiting for.</p><p><b>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</b></p><p><i>May 12, 2017</i></p><p>Everyone knows the story of King Arthur and the sword in the stone. However, this year, filmmakers have decided to take a dark turn on this classic tale. Starring Charlie Hunnam from “Sons of Anarchy” (2011-2014) and Jude Law from the “Sherlock” (2009, 2011) films, “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” turns the good-and-bad heroic tale of King Arthur into something far more complex, making the responsibility that comes with pulling the sword from the stone a much heavier burden than that of the original version. With this film comes a whole new twist on a myth that has been retold the same way for centuries, so go and see for yourself which version of the story you prefer.</p><p><b>Alien: Covenant</b></p><p><i>May 19, 2017</i></p><p>Whether or not you're a fan of the “Alien” franchise, this film is one of the biggest topics of conversation of the spring season. The sequel to “Prometheus” (2012), the first of the “Alien” prequel films, this film takes place before any aliens caused problems for Sigourney Weaver and her crew. When an expedition group made up of couples capable of colonization are sent to explore the outer reaches of space for a planet suitable for life beyond Earth, they happen to stumble upon a desolate planet that appears to be an uninhabited paradise. Of course, nothing goes as planned, and these unlucky explorers become the second crew to encounter one of the most terrifying sci-fi monstrosities to ever be put to the big screen.</p><p><b>Wakefield</b></p><p><i>May 19, 2017</i></p><p>Bryan Cranston, renowned Emmy-winning actor from “Breaking Bad” (2009-2013), stars in “Wakefield,” an independent movie that looks like it has enough potential to get the attention of the Academy this year. Following a man who runs away from his life in a most unusual way, the movie follows him watching from his attic as the ones he loved try and forget he ever existed. Simultaneously, Wakefield tries his best to unshackle himself from the restraints of the life he once lived. The number of things he must let go before he can truly be free may be too much for him to toss away completely, but only the movie can tell you just how far he’s willing to go to be free.</p><p><b>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales</b></p><p><i>May 26, 2017</i></p><p>Johnny Depp is back as everyone’s favorite pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow, in the latest “Pirates of the Caribbean” film! As is the case with all “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, one of Sparrow’s past enemies is back to take revenge, with powers more terrifying than any of the antagonists before it (they wouldn’t make it any other way). With the recent Pirates movies yet to be released, I can’t say I have many expectations for this film, except that Jack Sparrow will hopefully be as hilarious as he always is, finding even crazier ways to get himself out of trouble and making the movie worth a watch at least once just for the laughs.</p>	Article	180	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
797	﻿Toubab Art and the Mechanized Artist Dakar artists’ dependence on sales through tourism limits their originality. <p>Along the beach by the Point des Almadies, the westernmost point of Africa and a popular tourist destination, you'll find loads of the same kind of art, jewelry, and clothing scattered around.</p><p>One vendor sells batik (a dyeing technique in which wax is used to prevent parts of the fabric from being dyed) dresses with stripes, jewelry made of coconut shells and pretty plastic beads, and woven multicolored baskets with a cover and vertical grip bought from women working in a supplier workshop not far away. Two tents down, someone is selling the same thing, plus tiny wooden elephants, turtles, cats, and a variety of other animals that he sculpted himself, but no batik dresses. On the next block, someone is selling all of that, plus bags made of bright, quilt-like fabric with “African prints.”</p><p>Why, in markets and popular tourist locations, are dozens of vendors selling exactly the same wares, while original art is hard to come by?</p><p>Almadies is Dakar’s hub of expatriates and tourists, especially Americans and Europeans, or “toubabs,” the loosely thrown-around Wolof term for a white person or Westerner. (I'm of Indian descent, but I, too, am a toubab because I’m light-skinned enough and apparently have the air of an American.) Toubabs are the crowd that always seem to be hunting down Senegalese art.</p><p>Art has always been present in Senegalese culture—they wear batik, have decorative woodwork at home, keep fruit in woven baskets. However, today’s lower-middle class Senegalese homes and wardrobes house far less Senegalese art than those of expatriates. It makes sense that tourists and expatriates buy things that they see as characteristic of the culture they came to.</p><p>Like in the United States, you need to go into a formal gallery or studio to find original work. The tourist industry’s demand for what it sees as traditional makes it appealing for certain artists to branch away from Senegal’s fine artists into a uniform line of work. Artists became artisans. Wood sculptors became carpenters. Couturiers became tailors. The art feels handmade, but lacks uniqueness. Many toubab artists today can’t afford to be creative, think it safer not to, or simply have never thought about it.</p><p>In the Village Artisanal of Dakar farther downtown, Aliou Kanté sculpts daily alongside hundreds of other artists, smoothing small wooden beads, animal figurines, and decorative statuettes, as he has since 1985. He comes from a family of artists, and was brought to the Village by his older brother. His family is Laobei, a caste of woodworkers, of Guinean origin.</p><p>For centuries, strictly Laobeis made wooden sculptures. The Laobei artist Cheikh Sow, who also works in the Village making koras and sabar drums, explains that only they may cut down trees and know the incantations to do so without disturbing the spirits that the trees host. While the caste system is no longer present in Senegal, many Laobeis continue their family’s traditional profession, and they currently constitute the vast majority of woodworkers in Senegal.</p><p>Kanté loves his profession and wants to continue it, but explained that it poses large difficulties. Artists like him rely on business that comes almost entirely from tourists, but with the decreasing visibility and popularity of the Village Artisanal among tourists, due to the construction of a new road that gives drivers less of an incentive to drive by the Village, he earns little. He works for a full day but is forced to sell to retailers who buy at meager rates. Art sellers, like many in the stalls in Almadies, interact directly with often wealthier tourists and earn much more.</p><p>While he dreams of exposing his work in Europe and having it distributed throughout the world, I was surprised to hear that he doesn’t aspire to make any stylistic changes (I would expect international success to require more originality). He, however, has been working in the Village since 1985—meaning 32 years of unchanged style.</p><p>As it were, there are an immense number of artists in the field with Kanté who have developed a financial reliance on the chain of sellers and tourists, because it is an immediate solution for the lack of money in their pockets; change and creativity are risky.</p><p>It is detrimental that the art in demand among toubabs is stagnant, because it encourages many artists with large potentials to cater to a specific taste instead of working from personal inspiration. If expressing oneself is a risk, then it’s a part of artists’ job description.</p><p>Toubab artists need to have the opportunity to innovate; dependence on the tourism industry shouldn’t limit them. If Donatello or Rodin were confined to tiny animal figurines, the arts would have suffered. There is a danger in artists who want to express themselves feeling muted in an unhealthy industry that makes art a restrictive, menial labor.</p><p>What the industry needs is respect for those behind the beautiful culture that made it possible. It would be great if customers, especially toubabs, bought from the source. Prices must do justice to the time and labor exerted to make the art possible—artists ought to create unions, and the Senegalese government ought to lay down stronger legislation regulating labor (the arts are among many fields that this would benefit). Senegal will in the years to come, inshallah.</p>	Article	181	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
798	﻿Five-Minute Trends New York aka trendsetter of a city offers many innovative, exciting desserts. <p>Oh, New York, filled with the stench of success and $1.00 pizza. Evolution in the city that never sleeps means constantly innovating and experimenting with the art of food. Cookie dough, once relegated to the bottom of the freezer and the occasional baking expenditure, has now become the basis for a classy, hot pink cafe in Greenwich Village. Cake appears on towering waffle stacks in a perfect defiance of a healthy breakfast. Bagels are dyed in funky colors, a reflection of the hippie 1960s and of our overwhelming need to be unicorns. Here are some of the desserts New York famously offers:</p><p><b>Red Velvet WTF Waffles:</b></p><p>Prize for most original and glorious creation since Michelangelo's David goes to Clinton Hall’s Red Velvet WTF Waffles. For $15, you can enjoy the layered version of the junk food aisle in Clinton Hall, a spacious Battery Park restaurant. The Red Velvet Waffle is really three individual red velvet waffles stacked on top of each other with layers of ice cream, raspberry sauce, oreos, whipped cream, and more stuff in between. A slice of red velvet cake delicately perches at the top of the confection. Towering, incredibly rich, and dripping with gooey wonder, Red Velvet WTF Waffles are worth the hype and will surely leave your taste buds shook.</p><p><b>Rainbow Bagels:</b></p><p>Found on just about all of Instagram, rainbow bagels are the food equivalent of a Lisa Frank sticker set. Strongly resembling colorful play-doh rolled together, rainbows bagels are overly sweet, vaguely fruit-loopy, and offered with a variety of whimsical cream cheese fillings—from funfetti to Fruity Pebbles. Though created by The Bagel Store over 15 years ago, they’ve blown up fairly recently, praised for the experience and photo opportunity they provide more than the taste. You can get them at 754 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn, for only the cost of a long wait and about $7.00 per bagel. Or perhaps skip the train ride and go to Zucker’s instead.</p><p><b>Cookie Dough:</b></p><p>News alert: your favorite, but possibly dangerous, mid-baking snack has been turned into a  safe-to-eat dessert that can be be consumed shamelessly. Cookie Do NYC, a cheerful, Pinterest- worthy bakery found at 550 LaGuardia Place, is an homage to cookie dough in all its forms—in scoops, waffle cones, ice-cream sandwich, baked cookies and cupcakes, as pie filling, sundaes and more. Scooped cookie dough ($4 for a single scoop) is offered in 13 classic cookie flavors, ranging from commando (plain) to brownie batter to peanut butter snickerdoodle. With Cookie Do NYC regularly opening to long lines that wrap around the block, cookie dough is clearly in high demand. Driving its appeal is the innovation of a classic dessert that brings back nostalgic childhood memories and a sweet, smooth flavor. The verdict: drop in, but in the case of a mile-long line, hit up your local supermarket instead.</p><p><b>Deep Fried Oreo Pizza:</b></p><p>Eat away your computer science grade with the unexpectedly perfect combination of greasy goodness in the form of deep fried oreo pizza. Created in a relaxed, retro-style Krave It in Bayside, Queens, batter-covered oreos are deep fried to golden perfection, baked on top of a cheese pizza, and generously topped with powdered sugar and oreo crumbs. The perfect mix of textures—crunchy, sweet oreos combined with gooey cheese—makes the pizza ($16 per pie) pass as both a guilty pleasure dessert and a hearty meal. Not as popular as it should be, deep fried oreo pizza is the quintessential New York food.</p>	Article	182	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

801	﻿Meet Stuyvesant’s Newest Teachers Mini-profiles on the new teachers <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>At the start of every semester, walking into a classroom and seeing a new teacher can be daunting. But for some teachers, the first day can be just as intimidating because it is a completely new experience for them as well. This year, Stuyvesant has gotten many promising new additions to the teacher staff. Here are some of their stories, from when they were inspired to start teaching to their hopes for their Stuyvesant experience.</p><p><b>Sunwoo, Chemistry</b>,<i> by Senjuti Gayen</i></p><p>Patrick Sunwoo is the newest addition to the Chemistry department here at Stuyvesant High School. Before coming here, Sunwoo taught at a high school in the Bronx for four and a half years. He taught various subjects, including Chemistry, Forensic Science, and AP Chemistry. “Pretty much everything science-related under the sun,” Sunwoo said.</p><p>Sunwoo’s decision to come to Stuyvesant was largely influenced by his friends at college; they had graduated from Stuyvesant and had told him great things about the school. From what he had heard about Stuyvesant’s reputation, he believed that its students would challenge him as an educator.</p><p>In the few weeks that Sunwoo has taught at Stuyvesant so far, he revealed, “I was blown away by how curious the students were and how much they already knew.” He recalled that at least two or three students already knew how to balance chemical equations before he even taught the lesson. He liked how students interacted with the teachers and how they were supportive of one another. “I guess you could say I like the vibe here,” Sunwoo summarized with a bright smile on his face.</p><p><b>Miner, Physics and Video Production</b>,<i> by Cathy Cai</i></p><p>Students lounging on the eighth floor may see a younger, unfamiliar face walking down the hallway: it’s the new physics teacher, Thomas Miner.</p><p>Miner’s interest with physics started long before he pursued teaching. “I had a great physics teacher in high school who was so inspirational,” Miner explained. “I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of physics and philosophy, answering big questions about existence—what we’re doing here and where we came from.”</p><p>Prior to coming to Stuy, Miner taught at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn. “It was my third year teaching,” Miner explained, “and I was asked, ‘Do you want to do more AP Physics?’ and I said, ‘No, I’m done with all this left-brain stuff.’” Although he loved physics, he wanted to take a break. Thus, Miner went back to graduate school and looked for something that was creative or interesting.</p><p>It was then that he found his passion in film. “I tried a film studies class, where we watched a film for every decade through American Cinema History and really loved it,” Miner said. His goal, however, when he graduated, was always to go back to teaching physics, and film, at a better school than John Dewey. The opportunity to teach at Stuyvesant as a physics teacher was an offer he couldn’t pass up.</p><p>But Miner didn’t forget his love for film. In addition to physics, Miner is teaching a new screen studies elective. “It’s called ‘The Physics of Video Production,’” Miner explained. “It’s very much film theory, film history, and the analysis of film. How we get to where we are with technology today? What is the progression of the medium from the technological base?”</p><p>Miner was clear to draw the distinction between film and physics, however. “Everything is physics, right?” he said. “But it’s not a physics class necessarily. We don’t go in depths of how cameras or sensors work.” It’s more similar to art history, in which students learn the rules of shot composition and how the process of editing has been applied and changed through time.</p><p>“It’s a lot of work planning [and] grading, but I’m happy to do it. It’s nice to see that students want to do it too,” Miner continued. “I get emails at two in the morning. I love how they care so much. I love how they’re constantly asking questions and seeking feedback. And I love the role I get to play in that.”</p><p><b>Lindemulder, French and German</b>,<i> by Amara Shein</i></p><p>For the first time in years, Miguel Ramirez is not the sole French teacher. With the addition of the new Level IV French Culture course, it would be against DOE regulations for Ramirez to be responsible for all of them.  That’s where Rebecca Lindemulder comes in, carrying textbooks and papers while she enthusiastically waits outside Ramirez’s fourth period French III class. She is both prepared and eager to teach French and German.</p><p>Lindemulder’s passion for foreign culture stems back to her own high school career. “I really liked [French] and I even went to France a couple of different times. I love it,” she explained.  During her travels, Lindemulder fell in love with the culture, food, and the little things such as simple relaxation that France offered her.  “It’s just something that I really enjoyed.  I liked being able to communicate in another language as well, so I wanted to be able to impart that ability to others and inspire others the same [way].”</p><p>Lindemulder pursued her master’s degree by teaching German in Germany. Afterwards, she taught the language at a high school in New Jersey. However, she wasn’t able to spread her passion for French culture when she taught there. When she found an online posting for a French and German teaching position at Stuyvesant, her curiosity led her to learn more about the school.</p><p>“I came here and was amazed to see how friendly Mr. Oliveri was and what a nice school this is,” Lindemulder said with a smile. As for the students, Lindemulder is in awe. “The kids here are phenomenal in how they’re engaged and attentive [during] the lessons. They really want to learn, and they’re really curious and want to show me what they already know,” she said. “I love what they’re bringing to the table. I think it makes a big difference.”</p><p>By exploring foreign culture and food rather than solely teaching words and grammar, she hopes to make her classes fun for her students. “Everybody raves about Stuyvesant and how much fun it is to be here, and that’s exactly what I’m experiencing.”</p><p><b>Esposito, English</b>,<i> by Maya Mitrasinovic</i></p><p>Dan Esposito had an unorthodox English-related journey before joining Stuyvesant’s English department. Even before college, Esposito knew he wanted to do something related to the subject, but teaching wasn’t on his radar yet. He became a food writer, doing freelance work and working in kitchens. Then, the perfect opportunity arose: a job as a taster for an import-export company. He stayed with the company writing flavor descriptions for a little over a year, until it began to feel like an average office job—but with more food. He felt that he had gotten so far away from his original love of words, and he wanted a job where he could see his work paying off. Teaching fit perfectly into that category, so he decided to change his career path and embark on this new journey.</p><p>So far, Stuyvesant has lived up to Esposito’s expectations. He grew up in Westchester and was a member of Iona Prep’s Speech and Debate team, through which he competed with Stuyvesant students, so he already had experience with the school. The fondness stayed with him for all these years, so when the opportunity arose, he decided to apply for a teaching job here.</p><p>The amazing things he had heard from Stuyvesant students years ago stayed true: his new students are excited and ready to learn, and as they engage with the material, Esposito can re-engage with himself. And he loves it.</p><p>Esposito is excited to see how the rest of the school year plays out. He hopes that he’ll be able to build good relationships with his students and that they’ll learn things they never expected to learn. When prompted, Esposito described himself as “interested.”  “I think a lot of people describe themselves as interesting, but I think it’s always more important to be interested in what’s going on around you,” he explained. He’s already learned so much from his students in such a short time, and with his interest in both their ideas and their success, he’s sure to have a great year.</p><p><b>Kincaid, English</b>,<i> by Maya Mitrasinovic</i></p><p>It had been eleven years since Kate Kincaid was a Stuyvesant teacher, and she couldn’t wait to come back. She started her career in English with a job in editing and proposal writing, and after attaining a graduate degree in creative writing, she decided that she wanted to teach.</p><p>Her first teaching job was at a middle school in Spanish Harlem as an academic intervention teacher (individually assisting students with learning a new skill or building strength in a skill), while she was substitute teaching at Stuyvesant. At Stuyvesant, she met [Assistant Principal of English Eric] Grossman, who called her as soon as an official teaching position in the department opened up. She stayed at Stuyvesant for a year and a half before going on maternity leave. Once her youngest kids entered first grade, she knew that she wanted to return, and was lucky enough to find a position open. “It feels like coming back home,” she gushed.</p><p>Kincaid feels that though Stuyvesant hasn’t changed very much in the past years, she has changed, and that makes her experience as a teacher very different. She thinks that she is a better teacher now, due mainly to the facts that she is better with kids and is more comfortable in her abilities than she was eleven years ago.</p><p>This is not to say that Kincaid’s transition has been stress-free. It’s hard to not be there to put her kids on the school bus in the morning, but she feels like she’s beginning to get into a routine again.</p><p>She’s working on being more organized, but still true to herself. “I don’t try to pretend I’m organized. I come in as I am, like, ‘this is me,’” she said. Kincaid wants to make sure that all her students are engaged—not just the “superstars” and big participators. Her openness in the classroom helps to create a welcoming community, for both her bright-eyed, eager freshmen and her worn-out, but sophisticated, seniors.</p><p><b>Staley, English</b>,<i> by Paulina Klubok</i></p><p>Judd Staley, one of Stuyvesant’s new English teachers, decided to become a teacher because of an advertisement on the subway. Though he had always loved literature and excelled in English, majoring in it college, Staley didn’t know what profession to pursue after college.</p><p>Since then, Staley has taught in four NYC Department of Education schools. His last school, the Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation in the Bronx, where Staley had been for the last five years, had a very different atmosphere from that of Stuyvesant. “In the Bronx, I was dealing with a lot of severely underprivileged kids—not that the kids here are privileged, but it seems like their needs are different, and it’s a big adjustment,” Staley said.</p><p>Despite the changes. Staley said his first week was great, citing his colleagues as his favorite part. “I really love the English department here and am enjoying getting to know everyone and learning a lot from what other teachers are doing,” Staley shared.</p><p>Staley, however, is very aware of the pressures placed on Stuyvesant students and hopes that in his first year, he can help his students deal with the stress. Staley hopes to find his place at Stuy this year—to get used to the rhythm and expectations of the school—and he aspires to “hopefully next year, really know what I’m gonna do,” he said.</p><p><b>Stuzin, English</b>,<i> by Vincent Jiang</i></p><p>For some students, Lauren Stuzin is a comforting familiar face. Once a student teacher for English teacher Megan Weller, Stuzin has returned as a full-time teacher, now with her own European Literature and American Literature classes.</p><p>For most of her life, Stuzin had been surrounded by English. Her father loved classical literature and often read Shakespeare to her as a child. Her love for English only grew in high school when her English teacher inspired her to read Shakespeare, which became her favorite period of literature. She then majored in English as a Cornell undergraduate, serving as the editor-in-chief of a student publication there, before pursuing her master’s degree at Columbia Teacher’s College.</p><p>Aside from her love of English, Stuzin also gravitated toward working with younger students; from being a ski instructor to a camp counselor, every job she had involved working with kids. “Being with kids makes life better,” she said.</p><p>Her first teaching experience was at I.S. 289, a middle school near Stuyvesant. Though it was fun, she discovered that she enjoyed the high school setting more.</p><p>Stuzin had her first taste of Stuyvesant as Weller’s student teacher, but when Weller unexpectedly went on maternity leave three weeks earlier than expected, Stuzin found herself thrust into leading the class without a guiding mentor. “First day, I was really overwhelmed,” she said. “I was just sweating the whole day, running around, trying to organize myself, and I think I started new books with all my classes that day; it was very hectic.”</p><p>As she grew more comfortable, however, she grew to love the school and the students here, leading to her seeking a full-time position. On the first day of the new year, she admitted she was a bit nervous, but she quickly grew accustomed to the rush of running her own classes.</p><p>Stuzin is looking forward to teaching “Macbeth,” her favorite Shakespeare play. “I would like to inspire any students that I have who may feel like English is not their thing, because I think it’s everybody’s thing; I think it’s relevant to everyone, reading and writing both,” she said.</p>	Article	195	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
802	﻿Boys Who Code Club Disbanded The Boys Who Code Club disbanded due to their similarities with other computer science clubs. <p>The Boys Who Code Club, created just a week ago, was disbanded after members realized the multitude of similarities between their club and the rest of the computer science clubs in the country. Founded by freshman Sudat Khan, the club was created to empower boys to pursue computer science fields and had several dedicated members.</p><p>“We felt left out after seeing the multitude of girls-only computer science clubs and thought, ‘What was so special about them?’” Khan said. “If girls can have their own computer science clubs, why can’t we? We were shocked to learn that many computer science clubs already foster this mentality in their male population.”</p><p>After Boys Who Code was disbanded, former members joined other computer science clubs in hopes that they could continue to feel empowered against the overwhelming female majority; these clubs include the Hacking Club, the Coding Club, and the Cybersecurity Club. Some, however, have protested against Boys Who Code’s closing by joining Girls Who Code, a Stuyvesant club dedicated to teaching girls how to code. While seniors and co-Presidents Sarah Yoon and Stephanie Yoon are completely fine with it, the male members feel oppressed in the female-saturated environment.</p><p>“I didn’t understand why all the girls were so intimidated while I was there,” an anonymous male Girls Who Code member said. “These girls are all going to be welcomed to STEM fields with open arms while guys would be rejected. Reverse sexism is a thing, and to say that guys have it much easier than girls in STEM fields is completely false.”</p><p>The Student Union (SU) was saddened to learn that the newly-chartered club would be disbanding after only a week. “We wasted $700 on this club to buy new laptops for the boys,” SU Vice President Tahseen Chowdhury said. “This funding could have gone to the ‘I Have Created This Club to Look Good For College Club’ to buy new traffic cones instead.”</p><p>Still, Khan is dedicated to his cause, wanting to make sure that all men fight against societal pressure to go into a certain field and pursue something they are interested in. “I’m going to create a Boys Who Engineer Club soon,” Khan said. “That doesn’t exist yet, right?”</p>	Article	188	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
803	﻿Tigers Clawing for Playoffs The cricket team, after a rough 0-7 start to the season, will try to overcome the early season hole to close out strong. <p>Freshman Vishwaa Sofat stepped up to hit against the Thomas Edison bowler and eyed him up. Sofat then smacked the next ball for a six, similar to a home run in baseball, except worth six runs. He and the Tigers, Stuyvesant’s cricket team, cruised to their first victory of the season.</p><p>After defeating Thomas Edison High School for their first win of the season, the Tigers will look to carry the solid play over for the remainder of the season and put their rough start behind them. The team currently sits at 1-7, which is last in their Bronx/Manhattan Division.</p><p>However, the team has not lost hope, even with the tough beginning. “We usually start off a little rough but end much better, so the fight isn’t over yet,” said senior and co-captain Vijay Daopersaud, who bowled well against Thomas Edison and helped lead the Tigers to victory with two wickets.</p><p>Senior and co-captain Gurpreet Singh shared a similar sentiment: “We still have six more games to go, and I believe in this team to go out there and win,” he said. Neither the captains, nor the rest of the team, will give in with so much of the season left to play.</p><p>In order to improve, the team will need to quickly gain the experience and mentality that only comes with playing the game for a long time. Many new players have had to step up and fill the roles previously occupied by seniors. “We lost around seven starters this past season. All of them had at least three years of experience playing the sport,” Singh said.</p><p>One of the few bright spots on the hitting side of the game, Sofat has become a force with the bat. He has scored a combined 54 runs over six games and will look to add to that total as the season draws on. “He really stepped up and provided much needed stability for batting and bowling and keeping, something done by very few players in the league,” Daopersaud said.</p><p>A consistent problem for this team has been run production. Their highest output was the 83 they scored against Thomas Edison in their win, but after that the next highest is more than five runs less, and the team averages about 60 runs per game. Opponents, meanwhile, have surpassed the 100-run mark four times against Stuyvesant, and Dewitt Clinton piled on 257 in a blowout Tigers loss. If this team has a shot to bounce back, they will need their batsmen to step up.</p><p>With 14 juniors on this year’s active roster and only two seniors, expectations were high but tempered. Last year’s team finished with an 8-5 record and was third in the division, making it to the second round of the playoffs. However, this year’s Tigers roster is younger and less experienced. Even though many would call this a rebuilding year, the captains believe in their team. “There are benefits in having a young squad. They have more years ahead of them and they all have a ton of potential,” Singh said.</p><p>With the season just over half finished, the Tigers will need to greatly improve their record in order to try and qualify for the playoffs. While that is an extremely challenging task, this team has the personnel and leadership to go on a run.</p><p>However, even if they fall short, the team is in position to rebound next year, with a huge junior class and underclassmen that have been practicing and improving this season. Either way, the Tigers are in position to make noise in the league sooner rather than later.</p>	Article	190	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
804	﻿Girls Badminton Comes Up Short The girls badminton team had an undefeated regular season but fell to Seward Park in the quarterfinal round to end their playoff run. <spec-img-carousel></spec-img-carousel><p>With a 4-0 lead over Maspeth High School, Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity badminton team’s second doubles, comprised of senior and co-captain Yiqing Hu and sophomore Tracy Chang, swiftly defeated their opponents without dropping a set. This sent Stuyvesant into the quarterfinals of playoffs, where they would face Seward Park Campus, one of their toughest rivals of the season.</p><p>The team, after succumbing to a 3-2 loss at the hands of Seward, were eliminated from playoff contention on May 12. This ended their quest for an undefeated season, as they were 9-0 heading into the match (including their one prior playoff game).</p><p>The team dominated their competition in part because most teams are brand new, badminton being made a Public School Athletic League (PSAL) official sport just four years ago. “I feel really positive about the season. Both of our losses [against Seward] were quality losses for our teams,” coach Hugh Francis said.</p><p>This season, Stuyvesant defeated Seward Park Campus 3-2 in the fourth match of their season. This was the only one-point game Stuyvesant had in the regular season, fueling tension that led to the Seward Park victory in the playoffs.</p><p>This led to the rivalry between the two schools and will continue next season. Seward’s badminton team is known for its dedication and intensity both on and off the court. “Seward, the school we lost to, is devoted to the sport, as they even film the games and analyze them afterwards,” Hu said. Stuyvesant will try to match that intensity this coming offseason to exact their revenge next year.</p><p>Considering how Seward’s team prepares for its matches against other schools, Stuyvesant was able to make Seward really work for its wins. Although Seward had triumphed in two out of their three matches against Stuyvesant this year, Stuyvesant was able to pull away by a score of 3-2 early on. After the initial victory, Seward changed its strategy in order to win the second doubles games at the next two matches, turning the tables for a 3-2 win for them. “They switched out players for the later games,” Chang said.</p><p>Even with the tough loss at the end, this was still an incredibly successful season for the team. “Compared to previous years, we did much more conditioning and even running than we did in the past,” Hu said. The extra effort from the players led to more endurance as the season wore on, putting the team in a better place to succeed.</p><p>One revelation for the team has been the play of sophomore Lucy Wang. “[She was] able to become a starter as a third single,” Hu said. That play is crucial if Stuyvesant wants to come back and get revenge on Seward Park next year.</p><p>In order to do so, the team needs to work on their execution during games. “We should still improve on serving, especially not making serving errors, hitting in, and many badminton technical skills, such as netting and dropping,” Hu said.</p><p>“They were getting caught off balance—that’s something to work on,” coach Francis said. This comes with practice and repetition, so these abilities will hopefully translate into a deeper postseason run next season.</p><p>However, a repeat undefeated season will be difficult. Hu, along with three other seniors, will be gone next year. Younger players will have to step up and fill their places in order to keep competing. Hu remains confident in her teammates and their ability to lead the team to a better place in the playoffs next year. “I look forward to the team’s future,” she said.</p>	Article	191	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
805	﻿What College Taught Me My time at Harvard taught me about how I really should be thinking about school and measuring my success in it. <p>On a Saturday in June, I overpacked my blue suitcase and boarded a train north to South Station in Massachusetts. On the train ride there, I read a paper about how pigs and baboons are now being used to grow organs that can be grafted into humans in a cross-species process called xenotransplantation.</p><p>For the next two weeks in Cambridge, I lived in Harvard University’s recently renovated Dunster Hall, where I taped photographs of my friends and family on the wall, dragged a white trash bag full of dirty clothes down to the basement where I learned how to do laundry, ran 9:45 p.m. coffee runs to the nearest CVS with my roommates in the rain, and occasionally had a bag of Swedish Fish from the vending machine for dinner, even though the Pre-College program offered a full meal plan.</p><p>I slipped on my slides with socks as I picked up a chocolate Pierce Brothers coffee at Annenberg Hall every morning and chose a spot in Widener Library. Surrounding me were other rising high school juniors and seniors with identical crimson lanyards around their necks, all equally as excited, nervous, and hyped up on sugar and whatever was floating around in the Cambridge air that day.</p><p>My classmates and I visited our professor’s lab and saw mice, zebrafish, and axolotls, met in the basement of Dunster for gossip and study sessions, and had an after-hours dance party at Chipotle. It was there that we fleshed out the applications of CRISPR and stem cell research techniques as we had burritos and my friend from India had his first-ever taco. We keep in contact to this day, so I know that Taco Boy has an AP Biology test on Thursday that he’s worried about and that my friend who lives in Central California had her first ever date on Friday and is excited about her second.</p><p>Living an abbreviated college life as a high school student was in some ways like xenotransplantation. Before I started the program, college seemed distant. I had the impression that you had to reach a certain level of intellectual and emotional maturity in order to handle life away from home, and the people who could claim this sort of sophistication at the age of 16 or 17 were an entirely different species. But when I received my acceptance e-mail and an extremely generous scholarship to attend the program, I decided to take the plunge and take on the identity of a Harvard student for two weeks. This is what I learned.</p><p>College-level work is demanding. In an e-mail interview, Jacqueline Newcomb, the director of the Pre-College program, explained that the Pre-College program’s courses “are in line with the Harvard curriculum. Typically, we ask our faculty to cover almost a semester of work in the two-weeks, but with the understanding that when teaching daily, there may not be time to assign as much reading and writing as a freshman seminar would have. We ask that they assign two to four hours of homework per night. However, since the majority of our faculty are teaching Harvard students in the academic year, they model their summer course including the rigor after their semester courses.” As someone who wants to go into science journalism, I opted for a course on regenerative medicine and stem cell research, and I definitely felt the weight of the academics.</p><p>As a junior at Stuyvesant, I am all too familiar with what it feels like to be overwhelmed by school. Oftentimes, my classmates and I wake up before the sun rises and come out of school after it sets, and while walking home in the dark some days, it feels like high school is all we have. College is supposed to remedy the occasionally toxic academic community that being surrounded by three thousand of New York City’s top students creates. These students become desperate to graduate and get into college before they burn out.</p><p>Though I wasn’t falling asleep on my walks to class or crying at my desk at night, I was consistently challenged by my work at Harvard and had to put in long hours. One night, sitting quietly on the duvet in my dorm room with the lamp on and the door slightly ajar, I realized that college won’t solve my problems.</p><p>My classmates and I are running through our high school years with our eyes closed. We sleep in intervals of REM cycles so that we can maximize our nap time, sneak study guides into weightlifting class, and retake the SAT to bump the score up by 20 points. I go to a school of absolutely brilliant kids who push themselves to incredible lengths, telling themselves that once they get into college, they can pull the brakes on life and slow down a little. But college, and other institutions of higher education, can’t work that magic.</p><p>I no longer see college as a means of escape from the academic pressures of high school. The Spectator’s survey of the graduating seniors this year revealed that nine out of 10 seniors plan on going into an academia-based profession. But while studying to become a doctor, engineer, or lawyer is an admirable endeavor, none of us will be able to handle the necessary years of higher education unless we prioritize mental health over academic success, no matter how much satisfaction being able to wear a Stuyvesant or Harvard hoodie brings.</p><p>Because of this realization, I also came to think about why I love being a student here. Even though waking up at four in the morning to study for my daily physics quizzes is painful, I find a collective joy in meeting my bleary-eyed classmates in the morning. We cry together when school gets tough, and we celebrate each other’s victories because each one of them is so precious. My math tests are worth around three-quarters of my grade, but I care more about the teacher in front of the room and the gracious, quirky, and funny person she is than the number on my report card. The other Spectator editors and I stay up late at night to edit articles, but seeing our writers improve and distributing the papers when they come and seeing the smudges of dark ink on our fingers are worth 100 sleepless nights.</p><p>I’ll admit I felt a fleeting moment of pride when I received my crimson lanyard, but Harvard’s program has left a much more important impression on me than pride in the name of a school or the beauty of the architecture. I will remember how I felt when I ate lunch with my professor, how excited I was to learn about stem cell research, how satisfied I was after my partner and I presented our final project on nerve cell regeneration, and how heartbroken I was to leave my friends. Each and every day brought its own challenges, but I found a kind of strength in the support of the academic environment and my classmates.</p><p>We’re now scattered all over the world, but we all keep a photo of each other on our phones or on our desks so that we can remember what it was like to live unabashedly unashamed lives as biology nerds in Cambridge. When I look at my photos from that summer, I see a smiling girl with an overpacked blue suitcase who’s not as much of a stranger to the idea of learning to be a smarter, kinder, and more curious person anymore. Here’s to hoping that she will always be that way.</p>	Article	197	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
806	﻿There’s No Fall Without Pumpkin Spice Pumpkin Spice Lattes are probably why fall still exists. <p>Before there was pumpkin spice everything, there was fall; that dreadful time of the year when dirty, moist leaves get stuck on your shoes and you can’t tell if it’s summer or winter. However, in recent years, an autumn “aesthetic” has emerged: an obsession with “Instagram-able” fallen leaves, sweater weather, and of course, the pumpkin spice latte. So many chains offer the drink that all the choices might be overwhelming, so we visited three of the fastest-growing food chains in the U.S. to give you a glimpse of the taste of their pumpkin spice lattes.</p><p><b>Starbucks ($4.75)</b></p><p><i>5.0/5.0 stars </i></p><p>Our first stop was the Starbucks down Chambers Street that is situated right next to the 1, 2, and 3 train station. Starbucks, the epitome of the café industry, features a variety of drinks, from those in their ironically popular secret menus to the traditional espresso. Upon entering the dimly lit café, the harsh, busy mood of the city seemed to melt away. Customers sipped their drinks and typed away at their MacBooks while still more patiently waited for another warm round.</p><p>In a small cup with the signature Starbucks logo were our lattes, which smelled heavily of pumpkin spice seasoning. It was an adventure at first sip as the pumpkin spice latte topped with whipped cream led to a sweet tooth overload. When we had gotten over this, the spices characteristic of pumpkin spice lattes, including cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, produced a mouthwatering concoction. There has been little criticism for Starbucks’s drinks, and the same can be said for this fall variant. With the texture of an extremely creamy coffee and the aftertaste of a steaming cup of hot chocolate, it’s hard not to finish this drink within minutes unless you care to not burn your tongue.</p><p><b>Dunkin’ Donuts ($3.25)</b></p><p><i>2.5/5.0 Stars</i></p><p>Down by the A, C, and E trains is Dunkin’ Donuts, a brand most known for its array of glazed donuts and Munchkins. Although the store isn’t generally appreciated for its small selection of drinks and breakfast sandwiches, we headed to the small store to test its own take on the popular fall drink. As usual, the place was quiet and ordering lattes was a quick affair.</p><p>Dunkin’ Donuts’s pumpkin spice latte came in a dull brown cup and was as hot to the touch as it was to the tongue. When the burning sensation stopped, our first tastes were surprising. There was an excess of sugar and the latte tasted more like an Americano. Only near the bottom of the drink did we experience the spices that were usually offered in pumpkin spice lattes; however, they were so unabsorbed by the drink that the drink was quite disagreeable and led to a bad aftertaste.</p><p><b>McDonald’s ($2.00)</b></p><p><i>3.0/5.0 Stars</i></p><p>Just one short block from Stuyvesant itself, the popular fast-food chain is known for its inexpensive but questionable food and drink choices. Yet, the store is almost always booming with customers lining up to buy a cheap snack or meal. Characteristics of this McDonald’s are its  impossibly long lines and slow serving times. Faint music is drowned out by the loud chatter of people socializing and employees yelling out order numbers.</p><p>At first taste, McDonald’s pumpkin spice latte was rather bland, reminiscent of instant lattes made from powder where you forgot to add sugar. On the visual side, the latte seemed lacking as well; there were no decorative spices like those that Starbucks had offered, and it looked like just another watery coffee. We began to doubt that they had even gotten our order right. However, as we kept drinking, a sugary cinnamon taste gradually became stronger. By our last sip, the latte was overwhelmingly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste, similar to the one someone gets after eating too much sweet candy. With the cost in consideration, the drink wasn’t horrible. It’s an inexpensive, sugary drink with the flavor of pumpkin spice that only appeals to those with a major sweet tooth.</p>	Article	198	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
807	﻿Wu Tang: A Return to Former Glory? “Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues” was produced with the fans of Wu-Tang’s former glory days in mind, hence the album title’s allusion to a saga —the legacy of hip-hop’s golden age. <p><b>Enter the Wu-Tang</b></p><p>There are few greater introductions in hip-hop than RZA’s “Bring da mother[expletive] ruckus!” in Wu-Tang’s acclaimed debut album “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).” Since their entry into the scene in 1993, Wu-Tang did precisely that, as the group established a reputation as hip-hop’s arguably most legendary and talented group of rappers. Hailing from the projects of Staten Island, Wu-Tang was one of the most prominent players in the ‘90s East Coast hip-hop renaissance known for its dark, gritty sound and lyrical dexterity.</p><p>In spite of the success of groups that preceded them, such as the bad-boy groups NWA and Run-DMC, Wu-Tang aimed for a more cerebral approach, focusing on lyricism and wordplay and compromising aggression, catchiness, and volume in favor of a more stripped, minimalist sound to complement their lyrics. Wu-Tang’s songs are heavily influenced by the members’ experiences with gang violence, drug abuse, and poverty in the housing projects of Staten Island, which are ripe with storytelling possibilities.</p><p>A hallmark of Wu-Tang is the frequent references to kung fu and martial arts films in their work, which add an additional poetic layer to their lyrics. By incorporating Chinese philosophies and schools of thought, Wu-Tang created an unusual blend of Western and Eastern cultures, which was considered groundbreaking for hip-hop at the time. Elements of violent gangster rap were juxtaposed with Eastern themes of spiritual enlightenment. Wu-Tang also drew inspiration from the swift, brutal, and calculated blows seen in martial arts, metaphorically adopting those techniques into their unique style of rapping and representing rap battles within their songs as “duels.” These qualities highlighted the group’s unusual articulation of storytelling and drew in many listeners.</p><p>Wu-Tang’s most notable contribution to hip-hop was their album “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).” While well known for its raw and violent lyrics, the album also had trademark elements that defined the group: skits, soul and R&B sampling, and knowledge of martial arts films and Eastern culture. Consequently, Wu-Tang’s debut album established an unfairly high standard for their subsequent work as a group.</p><p>The general consensus in the hip-hop community is that the solo endeavors of members of the Wu-Tang Clan far eclipse their collective efforts with the exception of “Enter the Wu-Tang.” Albums such as Ghostface Killah’s “Ironman” (1996) and Raekwon’s “Only Built 4 Cuban Linx” (1995), to list only a few, are revered as some of the genre’s greatest. In the case of Wu-Tang, the whole is less than the sum of its parts as the group gradually garnered acclaim and attention through its individual members; every member has gone on to release solo albums in his career. Wu-Tang has no shortage of rappers that are dominant forces in their own right with their defining skills, whether it’s Raekwon’s vivid and violent imagery, GZA’s unmatched lyricism and vocabulary, Ghostface Killah’s storytelling and narration, Method Man’s eclectic persona, or RZA’s talent as a producer.</p><p>The mythical status attributed to Wu-Tang is almost certainly a result of the amount of raw talent the group possesses. However, the ability to utilize each member's’ skills to its fullest potential has eluded the grasp of Wu-Tang since the release of their first album, the groundbreaking idiosyncrasies of which have long lost their novelty. Subsequent Wu-Tang albums, though unfairly held to the incredibly high bar set by their debut, were criticized for trying too hard to outdo the creativity seen in “Enter the Wu-Tang.” Producer RZA had a large role in this, as he was responsible for orchestrating the sound and thematic elements behind many of the group’s songs. RZA often attempted to re-brand the group’s image with each new album release, departing from the qualities that made “Enter the Wu-Tang” such a success. The colorful dynamics and chemistry between each member were also lost after each one of them released successful solo albums in the late ‘90s and developed their own preferences for how an album should be produced.</p><p><b>The Saga Continues</b></p><p>24 years after the release of “Enter the Wu-Tang,” the group re-emerges into the radically changed music industry of 2017 with their latest album release “Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues.” Despite a slew of album releases this past decade, Wu-Tang’s re-entry into hip-hop in 2017 holds more significance than any of their other post-“Enter the Wu-Tang” albums, many of which were considered disappointments because of the current state of hip-hop that the group refers to throughout the album. Their previous album, “A Better Tomorrow” (2014), was an unsuccessful foray into the realm of contemporary pop, which produced considerably tame results stripped of the elements that made Wu-Tang a force to reckoned with in the past.</p><p>Hip-hop has taken a completely different trajectory since the ‘90s, a period often called its golden age. This distinction is apparent with the de-emphasis on both lyricism and musicianship, hallmarks which defined the golden age. Wu-Tang’s raw sound, which incorporates R&B, soul, and simple driving beats, would alienate most listeners of contemporary hip-hop. “Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues” was produced with the fans of Wu-Tang’s former glory days in mind, hence the album title’s allusion to a saga —the legacy of hip-hop’s golden age.</p><p><b>An Homage to the Old School</b></p><p>The intro of “The Saga Continues” begins with trumpets to signal a triumphant return after a three year hiatus. It also contains a familiar Wu-Tang trait: dialogue excerpts from martial arts films. RZA then interrupts and goes on on to establish the premise of the album by alluding to Wu-Tang as the “Buck Rogers” of the 21st century, a group that awakened from their slumber and found themselves amidst an unrecognizable future.</p><p>“The Saga Continues” really takes off following the intro with “Lesson Learn’d,” one of two singles in the album. Paying homage to the hip-hop classic “Nuthin But a ‘G’ Thang” (1992) by Dr. Dre with the opening verse lyric “One, two, three and to the foh,” Inspectah Deck immediately follows with swagger characteristic of Wu-Tang in the self-praising line “I splash bravado, fast cash aficionado / Savage vandal, I’m a legend of tomorrow,” demonstrating the group’s awareness of their considerable footprint and influence on the hip-hop world.</p><p>The next song “Fast and Furious” also pays homage to an old school hip-hop legend by sampling Biggie’s “Who Shot Ya” (1994), an East Coast classic known for its ominous piano melody and simple beat. The outright violent raps in “Fast and Furious” are stylistically reminiscent of the legendary feuds and battles of hip-hop that Wu-Tang had witnessed in the past. This notably includes the well-known East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry which the group helped spark by reviving the East Coast scene with their release of “Enter the Wu-Tang.”</p><p>The musicianship of “The Saga Continues” is also one of its strongest elements reminiscent of Wu-Tang’s classic works. This includes R&B/soul sampling and traces of jazz through a driving bass line, simple beat, and a piano melody quietly buried in the background sound in lead single “People Say,” much like the melody used in the Wu-Tang classic “C.R.E.A.M” from “Enter the Wu-Tang.”</p><p>However, the dark, gritty sound prevalent in early Wu-Tang works has a diminished presence in “The Saga Continues.” Rather, Wu-Tang draws musical influence from its fellow East Coast contemporaries and borrows heavily from jazz-centric rappers such as Nas and JAY-Z. Songs such as “If Time is Money” (Fly Navigation) and “Frozen” complement powerful basslines with an unusual array of instruments such as woodwinds and the xylophone. The album’s utilization of percussion is also a testament to its insistence on old-school sound and rejection of the rapid-fire trap beats that are ubiquitous in contemporary hip-hop. Wu-Tang consistently uses steady, snare-heavy beats to complement, not overpower, their instrumentation.</p><p><b>Beatdown of the New School</b></p><p>“People Say,” the lead single in the album, showcases the group’s dissociation from today’s social media-driven hip-hop, defined by rappers that are more in touch with mainstream pop culture. Rappers from the golden age were the antithesis to mainstream pop culture, often denying themselves a marketable image in favor of producing insightful lyrics and narratives of marginalized ghettos and projects, a side of society that was largely hidden from consumers. The biting social truths of golden age hip-hop are mostly absent in hip-hop and the music industry as a whole today, as making the Billboard Hot 100 has become a disproportionately larger measure of success than producing thoughtful lyrics and musicianship.</p><p>Keeping this in mind, “People Say” is a standout in the album. Method Man’s opening verse in particular contains a few gems, one of which is “Nah see I don’t dab and I don’t nae nae / Got bottles coming out, warriors coming out and play-ay,” distancing Wu-Tang from some of the most recent hip-hop fads. Method Man takes it slow with his flow and reminds his listeners of his unquestionable authenticity in the lines “Until my heart turns cold, I’m a product of the block / We used to cook the product in the pot, add soda turn the product into rock.”</p><p>Method Man’s verse in the song “Frozen” further points out the group’s distaste for contemporary hip-hop and firmly establishes this distaste as a major theme of the album. His lines “Music is life, I ain’t into fashion or ice / I ain’t into chain snatchin’, ain’t into smackin’ a wife” and “It’s always been about the struggle, y’all just didn’t get it / My hood trouble, if y’all don’t live here then don’t visit” are self-explanatory. Method Man criticizes rappers today for losing touch with the purpose of hip-hop: to evoke thoughts and emotions on social injustices, rather than to align with the trends of mainstream pop music. This sentiment is most apparent in the line “I push the limit while rappers is pushing gimmicks.”</p><p>In the song “Why Why Why,” RZA’s introductory lines “If I put my fist through the face of a racist, smack ‘em tasteless / Would I face three cases in court, locked in places? / Or shackled to a seat of a bus, a hundred of us / Life in America shouldn’t be so tough” bring to light the very questions that were asked several decades prior by many rappers. The interlude lines “No discrimination, peace and love / From generation to generation” are timely, given that the nation is being torn apart by terror attacks, debates over anthem protests, a rise of white nationalist groups, and a bitter divide between political parties.</p><p><b>Closing Comments</b></p><p>“Wu-Tang: The Saga Continues” shines in its homages to golden age hip-hop and its criticisms of contemporary hip-hop. The album’s social commentary and use of vivid narratives are also refreshing returns to hip-hop’s lyrical and poetic prowess that was the norm years ago. The album functioned as a collection of lyrics that showcased the unique skills and styles of each member that were present in each verse they took over, much like in “Enter the Wu-Tang”.</p><p>“The Saga Continues” is ultimately a success because it draws influence from Wu-Tang’s early works and does not deviate from the formula that originally rocketed them to fame. Given the state of hip hop today, Wu-Tang did not need to produce a groundbreaking album like they did in 1993. Rather, “Wu-Tang: The Saga Returns” is exactly the album that many rappers now need to take note of; this is how you do hip-hop.</p>	Article	199	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
808	﻿Turtles All the Way Dab Reviewing John Green’s latest novel, “Turtles All the Way Down,” as someone very familiar with his work and life, and through the lens of someone who also deals with mental illness. <p>I started reading “Turtles All the Way Down” by John Green a few days after receiving it in the mail on its release date, October 10, 2017. I had pre-ordered a copy (signed in green Sharpie) the day after I heard about it, because I am a White Girl (as in while writing this sentence, I literally pushed up my clear Warby Parker glasses and took a sip of my Tangerine La Croix Sparkling Water boss-level white). I am in fact so white, and so openly obsessed with the idea of John Green, that my father, who is in the habit of surprising me with books, also pre-ordered a copy he then had to cancel.</p><p>As the epitome of Green’s demographic (emotional white teenage chicks who read), my opinion of his new book is expected to be positive. But I don’t think you should read it because it’s “beautifully written and just breathtaking” or “EMOTIONAL,” (lines I stole from reviews of Green’s previous and most popular book, “The Fault In Our Stars.”) You should read it because it tells a story that is important for teenagers to hear in the midst of an epidemic of depression and anxiety: what it is to be someone or love someone who lives with debilitating mental illness.</p><p>“Turtles All the Way Down” focuses on Aza Holmes, a highly anxious high school junior in Indianapolis, Indiana. It satisfies everything you’re looking for in a Young Adult (YA) novel. There are teenagers in it. They go to class, and they fall in love, and there’s holding hands and some kissing. The characters are awkward and young in a real-feeling way, and they go on comedic adventures, where they piss off Holly, the Applebee’s waitress, by coming in every week to use up an excessive number of “Two Burgers for Eleven Dollars!” coupons. There’s clever banter about interspecies romance between Chewbacca and Rey and tender moments of emotional sharing. Bonus: Aza and another character, Davis, both have one dead parent for extra angst and emotional connection because absentee parents are a YA tradition. Spoiler alert; Davis is the romantic interest. Wow. What a shocker.</p><p>What makes “Turtles All the Way Down” unique within its genre however, is its very real portrayal of mental illness and obsessive thoughts.</p><p>I started reading “Turtles All the Way Down” in the middle of a mental breakdown. I was trying to get myself to stop crying. It was 11:00pm, and I hadn’t finished a single thing that day. There were no lights on in my room, and I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the carpet and treading frantically as my thoughts tried to drown me. I was convinced that the world was caving in, that everyone would be disappointed in me, and that I wasn’t living up to the expectations everyone else had for me. I picked up the book from my bedroom floor and turned on my reading lamp, hoping to find solace in its pages. I just wanted to stop crying.</p><p>Aza’s struggle with OCD does not feel romanticized; it feels crunchy and difficult and frustrating and awkward. Aza experiences mental health the way my friends and I do, and as I was reading it, I constantly heard our words in hers. I read Aza’s explanation, “I don’t know, I don’t like the feeling of having to take a pill to feel like ‘myself,’” in my best friend’s voice. When Aza talks to and about her therapist: “I wanted to tell her that I was getting better, because that was supposed to be the narrative of illness: it was a hurdle you jumped over, or a battle you won. Illness is a story you tell in the past tense,” I read in my own.</p><p>I’ve always been a fan of Green’s work; beyond novels, he and his brother Hank Green run an internet empire centered around their YouTube channel “vlogbrothers.” Part of what draws me to their online work is how Green has always been public about his mental health, and in the last year, has been increasingly candid about his OCD. “I experience these obsessive thought spirals in which intrusive thoughts, that is, thoughts that I don’t want to have that seem to come from outside of me, sort of hijack my consciousness,” he said in a vlog published this July, titled “What OCD Is Like (for Me).” “If I can’t choose my thoughts, and I am at least partially made up of those thoughts, am I actually the captain of this ship I call myself? And the more you think about that, at least for me, the more it becomes like… the premise for a horror movie.”</p><p>The veritas of his experience and the eloquence with which he translates it into fiction is what makes the book rich and valuable, rather than just entertaining. This novel is warm,  satirical, and romantic. It is a comfort food for the YA reader. But as a young person in an increasingly emotionally-tumultuous age, it is recognition for my experience.</p><p>In the last few weeks, I’ve been made aware that for people who haven’t experienced mental health, it can be incredibly difficult to empathize. “I never viewed PTSD and stuff as real,” a girl in my English class shared. “I never got why that wasn’t something you could just get over.” Another friend confided in me that when her sister was dealing with severe anxiety and depression, her family didn’t really understand what was happening — to them, it seemed like something she should be able to get over. And I’ve even had those thoughts myself: the painful thing to ask myself is why I won’t just do my homework. It’s difficult to understand that sometimes the problem is bigger than yourself. Reading “Turtles All the Way Down” is valuable because it creates empathy links, either helping neurotypical people understand neurodivergence, or reminding mentally ill people of the importance of self-forgiveness.</p>	Article	200	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
809	﻿Greyducks Continue Streak of Borough Championship Victories The Greyducks accomplished their goal of winning the Manhattan Borough Championships and look ahead to their next goal of qualifying for the state championships. <p>Junior Justin Zhang cramped up in the middle of the 4-kilometer varsity race in the Manhattan Invitational at Van Cortlandt Park on Saturday, October 14 and was forced to drop out. Just two weeks later, he finished third in the Manhattan Borough Championship varsity 5-kilometer race. This turnaround was symbolic of the performance of the entire Stuyvesant boys’ varsity cross country team, who bounced back from near last place in the Manhattan Invitational to winning the Borough Championship at Van Cortlandt Park on October 28.</p><p>The Greyducks entered the championships with an ample amount of pressure. In the last decade and a half, when the team was coached by Mark Mendes, they never lost a borough championship. However, the Stuyvesant team had been beaten badly by the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering (HSMSE) team at the Mayor’s Cup, and therefore, it was no longer thought that the team would win.</p><p>In the Manhattan Borough Championship varsity race, sophomore Baird Johnson finished second with a time of 18:14.79 and was followed by Zhang in third place, who ran an 18:28.25. A trio of Greyducks, senior and co-captain Minhein Htet, senior Clive Johnston, and senior and co-captain Jesse Sit placed in sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively, accomplishing coach Carl DiSarno’s game plan. “[My goal for the team is to] break up [HSMSE’s] pack,” coach DiSarno said. Junior Caleb Hoo placed 12th and sophomore Oliver Cai placed 14th to round out the varsity team.</p><p>Zhang, Htet, and Sit all ran personal bests at the meet, but had higher expectations for themselves. “I was hoping to run in the 18:20s, but I wasn’t able to,” Sit said.</p><p>Both Sit and Htet believed that the windy conditions lowered the times, but they were satisfied with the team’s overall performance. “The fact that people still ran better despite the wind shows that our team is getting stronger,” Htet said. He also thinks that their training has contributed heavily to their success. “The patience from building a proper base [and] then moving on to speed is finally paying off,” Htet said.</p><p>The junior varsity team dominated the event to the surprise of the upperclassmen. “I was shocked,” Htet said. The Greyducks had five of the top 10 finishers, with James Huang in first, Ramon Wang in second, Steven Zheng in fourth, Steven Tan in fifth, and Jacob Olin in ninth.</p><p>“Many of our JV runners set new personal bests,” DiSarno said. In both the varsity and junior varsity races, Stuyvesant placed first, followed by HSMSE in second and Hunter College High School in third.</p><p>The Greyducks now have their sights set on the city championships, which take place on Saturday, November 11. Despite having greatly improved from their first meet of the season, the Greyducks have to get even better in order to win the championships. “If you were to combine the results from the five boroughs, we currently sit fifth in the city. [The] top four [teams] make it to the Federation Meet, so we’ll need to perform our very best if we are to qualify,” Coach DiSarno said.</p><p>Captains Sit and Htet are both hopeful that the Greyducks will be successful in the city championships and qualify for states. “If we keep doing what we have been doing, getting the mileage and the speed work in, we can definitely beat out the other contenders for the third and fourth spots,” Htet said.</p><p>“If one of the top four teams slips up, I think we’ll be ready to pounce,” coach DiSarno said.</p>	Article	201	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

After Randi Damesek accepts Michael Espinosa’s promposal, the two end up getting married and living in suburban Nantucket with their seven children and their minivan. <p>When Assistant Principal of Organization Randi Damesek agreed to go to prom with senior Michael Espinosa, she had no idea that she would soon fall in love with the plucky senior and end up marrying him, having seven kids, moving to Nantucket, buying a 2008 Honda, and driving their seven children to soccer.</p><p>Espinosa’s promposal to Damesek was a shock to everyone, especially Damesek herself. “Michael asking Damesek to prom was one of the most surprising announcements I had ever heard,” sophomore Alexa Valentino said. “The only other announcement as unbelievable as Michael’s was when someone said that the Peglegs had actually won a game.”</p><p>Even more startling than Espinosa’s promposal was Damesek’s reply: a resounding yes. “When I first heard Michael’s question, I was aghast that a student would have the audacity to ask me to prom,” Damesek commented. “After some thinking, however, I realized that going to prom would allow me to try out my new megaphone, the ILoveTheSoundOfMyVoice2000, so I said yes.”</p><p>When Espinosa and Damesek turned up to prom wearing matching pantsuits and grimaces, everyone there realized a new power couple had just been formed. “After seeing Damesek and Espinosa party together, I now know what to comment on the ‘name a more iconic duo, I’ll wait’ memes,” junior Jacqueline Cao said.</p><p>As the epic night drew to a close, Espinosa shocked everyone once again by asking Damesek to marry him. Onlookers somehow managed to be even more shocked, however, when Damesek said yes. “After seeing her hide in a closet for 45 minutes to just scream at some kids for making out, I knew she was the one for me,” Espinosa said.</p><p>The happy couple now lives in a timeshare in Nantucket with their seven children: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth.</p>	Article	185	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-30 00:53:18.944008
880	My Odyssey Teaching in New York City Schools, and What I’ve Learned From It.  <p>In 2008, I accepted a position as head of history at KIPP New York City College Preparatory School. I was then teaching at the American School of São Paulo in Brazil. I was in my ninth year living abroad. I had left the U.S. when Bill Clinton was president, and would be returning to an America that had recently elected Barack Obama. During those years away from home, i always made a point of stopping in New York when I was visiting the U.S., and catching up with old friends. One of them worked for KIPP. We had taught together in the late 1990s at the High School for Environmental Studies on West 56th Street. He had left the school a year or two after I had to go work at KIPP Academy Middle School in the Bronx. His old classmate at Riverdale had opened the school in 1995, and he was drawn to its mission and impressed with its results. He gave up teaching and worked full-time as a guidance counselor, helping to place the school’s graduates in elite private schools in New England and the greater metropolitan area, and then mentoring the students’ progress throughout high school. He found this to be very fulfilling work, and he’d share this with me when we met during my visits to the city. In 2007, he mentioned that KIPP was thinking of starting a high school for its middle schools to feed into (the program had expanded to Harlem and Brooklyn). He asked if I’d be interested in coming home and helping to start the school. The pay was significantly higher than that of public school teachers, and the media was pushing charter schools as the progressive future of education in the U.S. Personally, I loved the idea of founding a history department with high academic standards and expectations for black and Latino inner city youth. So in June 2009, I came home.</p><p>Within a very short period of time, I recognized that the vision I had for KIPP NYC’s history department was not shared by the administration. Partly because of the benchmarks they had to meet to maintain their charter and partly because of their own orthodoxy, the administration was fixated on test prep for the regents exams. Their approach was a lock-step regimen centered on rote learning. The class period was strictly broken down into specific blocks of time for certain activities—none of which fostered critical thinking and most of which sucked any joy in learning the material that students may have had outside of the classroom. What struck me most was the absolute certainty with which the administration, and a core group of faculty members, wielded this orthodoxy like missionaries with Bibles. There was the KIPP way and that was it. I was fortunate in that my friend was the dean of academics by this time, which shielded me to a certain extent from the worst of it. The principal of the high school was not yet 30 years old, and had taught middle school English for a handful of years. How this qualified her to lead a high school is a question that any reasonable person would ask. My students were shocked when they learned that I was over 40 years old and a father. They had never been taught by experienced teachers. With its ranks primarily filled by well-meaning but underqualified Teach for America cadres handing out graphic organizers, KIPP touted its students’ test scores as a measure of their academic success. Whether they were actually getting a first-rate education or not is another matter. I left the school in June of 2010. Little did I realize then that my odyssey was just beginning.</p><p>Because I had left KIPP with no position waiting for me else- where, I had to really scramble. There was a hiring freeze at that point in the city’s public schools, so only schools that were considered to be the most distressed were eligible for waivers to get around the freeze. In the end (over Labor Day weekend, no less), University Neighborhood High School on the Lower East Side informed me that they had received a waiver to offer me a position. I was thrilled. It felt so good to be back in the New york City public school system where i had started my career. The school was located in a beautiful, if worn, old Beaux-Arts-style building built in 1903. Originally, it housed p.s. 31, which had educated the neighborhood’s elementary-age children for decades. In the 1960s, the nearby Seward Park High School annexed the building to house its overflow student population. This was the school that author Frank McCourt had taught at for a number of years before coming to teach at Stuyvesant. As it was in his day, UNHS (the successor school to Seward Park Annex) was a very diverse, low-performing school. Fights were common—between both male and female students—and there were days when I spent the entire class period just trying to get students to behave and be respectful of each other. There were other days when great things were happening in the classroom. In fact, one of my best memories as a teacher was an Athens/Sparta debate I held with a class full of students who had failed the Global History Regents exam and were preparing to take it again. The analytical thinking, the quick thinking, and the sheer joy of learning that were evident throughout the classroom made all the tough times worth it. The administration, headed by a veteran math teacher, was very supportive, and I was more than happy to help in any way I could. But slowly things changed. The external pressures placed on the school, because it was labelled “SINI” by the state, meant that the administration was running scared trying to stay one step ahead of ex-Mayor Bloomberg’s school closure “chopping block.” The same oppressive orthodoxy that had permeated KIPP began to be felt at UNHS. It was sad because even though it was a tough school, there was some good teaching going on there. By my second year, room for any kind of individuality or differences in approach to teaching was discouraged. My classroom was the last one to be altered, but altered it was. Based on my conception of what teaching is, by the end, I was actually teaching in only one of my classes (a single section of AP). In my other four classes, anyone could have handed out the worksheets that I was handing out and taken attendance. I had become superfluous. Maybe that was the intention of the “reformers.”</p><p>There’s one interesting anecdote that is worth reciting here, because I feel it sheds a clarifying light on what is wrong with the charter school model (whether it’s actual brick & mortar charter schools like KIPP or simply the charter approach that has been forced on low-performing public schools). In 2011, when I realized how UNHS was going to change, I interviewed for a position at the Dwight Englewood School in New Jersey. Dwight Englewood is an elite private school just across the George washington Bridge from New york. Its student body is drawn from well-to-do families on either side of the Judson River. it was clear at the end of my interview that I was close to being offered a position. And then they asked me about KIPP. I told them that i hadn’t been enamored with many of the ways that the school was operated or funded, but most importantly that the students were not encouraged to think critically, that this had been the deal-breaker for me. To my relief at the time, the high school principal said that this was exactly Dwight Englewood’s take on KIPP. Over the years, KIPP had tried to place its middle school graduates at the school, and they had all been turned down because in interviews, there was clearly something missing in their make up as students. He offered me the position. Ultimately, I turned it down because I felt that I was in the front line trenches of the new school wars in the city and that this was a chance to be part of history (maybe I should have had my head examined). So i stayed at UNHS. Interestingly, during the interview process, I was informed that Dwight Englewood was considering doing away with having their students take standardized exams altogether, that the courses they had were superior to any external curriculum and that the exams had a distorting effect. And parents were lining up to get their children into this school! What is it exactly that schools like Dwight Englewood know that charter school advocates don’t know? This is an important question.</p><p>How does the odyssey end? Well, Ms. Dunkel had a baby. A position opened here at Stuyvesant, and I jumped at the chance to come back to where it all started for me back in 1995. Teachers and students at this school are lucky. Real teaching and learning goes on in classrooms here. This isn’t the case in most charter schools and low-performing public schools, with their emphasis on test prep. I’m grateful every day I walk across the footbridge and through the doors of Stuyvesant. I have to admit though, that I wish all teachers teaching in the city’s public schools felt this way. They should. That so many don’t is a damning indictment of the obsession with test prep, “accountability,” and data that has permeated the system. It’s also an indictment of the demoralizing effect placing responsibility for larger societal ills on the shoulders of veteran teachers has had. NYU education historian, Diane Ravitch—once a supporter, and now a fierce opponent, of charter schools—quoted W.E.B. Du Bois in her latest book, “Reign of Error,” regarding this issue:</p><p><center><i>“No school, as such, can organize industry, or settle the matter of wage and income, can found homes or furnish parents, can establish justice or make a civilized world.”</i></center></p><hr><p><i>*“Knowledge is Power Program.” Founded in houston, Texas in 1994 by two Teach for America alumni.</i></p><p><i>*“School in need of improvement.”</i></p><p><i>*KIPP receives generous - nancial assistance from the wal- ton Foundation (the wal-mart fortune), the Gates Foundation, and the Broad Foundation: all of which use their great wealth to shape policy. in accepting fund- ing from such institutions, Kipp is in no way out of the ordinary for charter schools.</i></p>	Article	278	2017-12-08 03:12:23.549264	2017-12-08 03:15:24.005521
998	﻿Choking on Coal The Trump administration’s shift to coal is dangerous both to public health and the environment, not to mention bad for the country economically <p>Every morning before dawn, a line of trucks begins to form outside of a city. Stretching for miles on a two-lane road, these trucks inch ever so slowly into a brown haze that obscures everything around for miles. This is the reality every day in Linfen, a city in central China. Once known as “the Modern Fruit and Flower Town,” Linfen has been transformed from a city of natural beauty to one of the most polluted cities in the world over a few short decades due to excessive coal mining.</p><p>The United States and the rest of the world are turning their focus to the Asia-Pacific region as it quickly becomes the home of the most dynamic economies in the world. President Donald Trump himself recently returned from a 12-day trip to Asia. Instead of focusing on renewable energy, Trump appealed to world leaders to invest in the American fossil fuel sectors to push exports all over the world. But in countries like Indonesia and China, this shift back to fossil fuels comes at a great risk to populations which have been devastated by the environmental impacts of oil and coal.</p><p>Examples of this backwards slide include Vietnam, which announced it is reverting to coal production after failed ventures into renewable energies. Japan, too, is moving ahead with plans to close down all of its nuclear reactors and replace them with coal plants. But to examine how the United States can have an impact on this, it is critical to consider why countries are choosing to shift back to fossil fuels. In Japan, the choice comes down to whether or not they should spend $36 billion on United States solar technology, or build cheaper coal plants. When Trump and Congress choose coal over subsidizing the growing renewable energy industry, they drive up the cost of renewable energy around the world, and the people of Japan and Vietnam suffer because of it.</p><p>Under the Trump administration, several factors look to benefit the coal industry greatly. With his dismantlement of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP), which invests U.S. money in renewable energy, Trump is also stripping away the environmental restrictions, enabling coal production to ramp up in the United States. Though the repealing of the Clean Power Plan will marginally restore coal’s place in the United States, this action will do more harm to the environment than economic good. That’s because a strong coal industry damages the health of thousands of Americans, while providing economic benefit to almost no one.</p><p>The CPP, had it been preserved, would have prevented 1,500 to 3,600 premature deaths per year among Americans, according to the EPA. Now, lives are being held at risk over the the Trump administration’s agenda to skirt a reported $33 billion in cost of coal regulations. Furthermore, the U.S. Energy and Information Agency predicts coal will only regain one percent of its lost market share with the repeal of the CPP, underscoring the waste of such an action.</p><p>But the biggest issue with the Trump administration’s shift back to coal is the actual oversight of the industry. With the repeal of Obama-era regulations and subsequent government oversight, the coal industry is ripe for environmental and human catastrophes. Putting aside the many mine accidents and health risks associated with coal miners in recent years, focusing on restoring coal leaves miners unprepared for a changing economy. The principal concern for Trump should be employment for Americans in general, irrespective of the industry. Since 1990, renewable energy has seen over 1200% growth in size as it produces larger and larger shares of consumed energy. Investing in coal mining leaves coal miners overlooked for critical job training as the renewable energy sector inevitably takes over, giving them an ultimatum on their employment.</p><p>Though it is the poster child for pollution, China is not the only country which suffers from the harms of fossil fuel use. In America, cities such as Los Angeles are routinely choked with smog, causing thousands of premature deaths every year. And with Trump now at the helm of the world’s largest economy, slowly but surely the world is beginning to slide back towards the waiting embrace of the coal industry, with great damage to people both here in America, and abroad.</p>	Article	396	2018-01-23 02:44:55.546376	2018-01-23 02:44:55.546376
999	﻿Reforming Republicans Republicans need to learn to understand the struggles faced by younger American generations and show that they have the answers. <p>The result of the 2016 presidential election shook the world. Donald Trump, a businessman with no previous political experience, was elected to the most powerful position on the planet. Trump spent a large portion of his campaign disparaging anyone he viewed as an opponent. The presidency would force him to find a way to unite Americans, even those he had estranged. His largest political challenge would be uniting the Republican establishment, much of which he had alienated, behind his agenda.</p><p>Trump’s victory was meant to herald the start of a new era for the Republican party. Party orthodoxy meant little to the temperamental political novice. He railed against free trade, abandoned traditional political rhetoric, and aggressively attacked Republicans for their perceived inaction on the issue of illegal immigration.</p><p>While Trump was not the ideal presidential candidate, Republicans hoped that his unabashed aggression and their new majority in all three houses of government, which they have not possessed since 1928, would aid the party. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan spoke for many when he said that the conflicts between Trump and the Republican party were “over and done with” and that the party was ready to work with the newly elected president.</p><p>Yet, as the cliché goes, expectations are a far cry from reality. In 2017, the Republican party has floundered. It has flattered to deceive, failing to make good on its promise to reform healthcare, losing a senate seat in Alabama due to its decision to run Roy Moore as a candidate, and finding itself mired in petty scandals and the shadow of the Russia investigation. The attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare was an enormous letdown to the party’s base and a failure of leadership. It was not only poorly planned, but poorly executed, perhaps epitomizing the GOP’s year.</p><p>Attempting to push through legislation, which according to a Quinnipiac University poll had a 20 percent approval rating, was never going to go well. But the way the bill met its fate was even more damaging. The bitter debate that occurred between conservative and moderate Republicans exposed ideological chasms between center and hard right factions within the party. The bill being defeated, brought back, defeated, brought back, and dramatically defeated for the final time was politically detrimental. Politico, Quinnipiac, and the Economist conducted polls in the aftermath which found Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's approval rating in his home state of Kentucky to be as low as 15 percent, significantly lower than the 21 percent it had been at the start of the year.</p><p>An SSRS poll found that fewer than three in 10 Americans hold a favorable view of the Republican party. This number is down 13 percent from March. In fact, this is the lowest number since SSRS polling began in 1992. Even a majority of Republican voters believe that their party leaders in Congress are taking the party in the “wrong direction.” Poor messaging, failed policy proposals, and the scandal-ridden Trump administration have tarnished the Republican party’s image. It is abundantly clear that the Republican party needs to do some serious soul-searching if it is to have a political future.</p><p>The Republican party should start its reform by assessing the strength of its voter base. Despite holding the majority in the House of Representatives, Republicans lost the popular vote. President Trump also lost the popular vote by a far greater margin. Republicans won largely due to gerrymandered districts, and the fact that Democratic voters tend to live in urban areas which Democratic candidates win overwhelmingly, whereas Republican voters are more spread out. But Republicans cannot rely on creative district drawing and convenient demographics if they want to achieve any tangible legislative change. The party needs a new message that can attract alienated voters both within and outside the party.</p><p>An important demographic which Republicans should strive to integrate into the party is the millennial generation. Millennials overwhelmingly back Democratic candidates, with the Pew Research Center finding that over 54 percent of millennials are Democratic. 2016 was the first election in a long time in which Baby Boomers and older generations did not cast the majority of the vote. The millennial vote will only continue to gain importance, as its size and turnout are both projected to increase, and winning elections without millennials will only get more difficult.</p><p>To attract the millennial vote, Republicans need to rebrand their party and present themselves in a new light. Many young voters are drawn to the Democratic party by its proposals concerning economic equality and social welfare. Republicans need to respond by becoming empathetic and presenting themselves as “compassionate conservatives.” They need to show that more government is not the solution to issues such as healthcare. They need to listen to arguments about the ridiculous amount of student debt and overwhelming drug prices. They need to learn to understand the struggles faced by younger American generations and show that they, the Republican party, have the answers. By acknowledging the existence of man-made climate change, working to reduce skyrocketing tuition costs, and presenting more thoughtful anti-poverty policies, Republicans can attract the votes of millennials, poor Americans, and the highly educated, demographics which are currently overwhelmingly Democratic. Rather than molding itself in the model of the overzealous, angry, and blustery Steve Bannon, the Republican party needs to make itself more appealing to these moderate Democrats and Independents.</p><p>The tax plan that was recently passed represents a step in the right direction in terms of enacting policy that directly helps a vast majority of Americans. However, there is still plenty of work to be done if Republicans want to reform the way they are seen by the American public. As the political time bomb that is the 2018 midterms draws nearer, it is imperative that this reform begins now. It's time to change the Grand Old Party.</p>	Article	397	2018-01-23 02:45:05.210351	2018-01-23 02:45:05.210351
810	﻿The Determination of the Mimbas The Mimbas are defeated in their second game of their playoffs, but have high expectations because of their prospects <p>Facing off against Midwood High School in the first round of the playoffs, Stuyvesant’s girls’ soccer team, the Mimbas, played a tightly contested game. After giving up an early lead, senior and co-captain Saloni Majmudar tied the game up in the first half with a solid assist by sophomore Selene Kaehny. Then, nearing the end of the half, Kaehny hit a decisive free kick to give the Mimbas the lead that they wouldn’t relinquish for the rest of the game. This was the team’s first playoff win for the graduating senior class, and they savored every moment of it.</p><p>Once again, the Mimbas’ defense played a critical role in the win. For the sixth time in 16 games, the team limited its opponent to under two goals. This defensive-minded approach takes pressure off the offense by limiting the opposing team’s scoring. “I was really proud of how we played,” Majmudar said.</p><p>Sadly, in the following game, the Mimbas lost a difficult match of 6-0 against Francis Lewis High School, ending their season. Even though the match was one-sided in its outcome, the team fought until the end. “We definitely played our hearts out for the full 80 minutes. We knew we were going into a tough game, playing the two seed, but we didn’t let that get to our heads,” senior and co-captain Charlotte Ruhl said. However, after such an exhilarating game two days prior, the team did not have enough to muster another victory.</p><p>Though the team lost in the second round, the Mimbas have been steadily improving since the current seniors first arrived. “During my freshman year, we only had one win so it was so rewarding to see my four years of hard work on the team pay off,” Majmudar said. Each year, the team has improved. After going a combined 3-22 in 2014 and 2015, the team jumped to 6-5 in 2016 and had a playoff berth. Unfortunately, they lost in the first round to Cardozo High School, 3-0. This year, the team made it to the second round and finished with a tie for third in its Manhattan A2 division, the highest finish to date.</p><p>Overall, this team will hopefully continue to improve for next season. Only three players will be graduating—Majmudar, Ruhl, and senior Sophia Gunluk—so much of the team will remain the same. Many of the team’s offensive players will also be back, as sophomores Kaehny and Eve Wening, as well as freshman Aki Yamaguchi, who scored eight goals each, will provide an elite 1-2-3 combination for the offense next year. After a taste of the playoffs this year, this young and competitive team will remain strong in the upcoming years. “I can’t wait to see how this team continues to grow in the years to come,” Ruhl said.</p>	Article	202	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
811	﻿Greyducks Dominate Borough Championships Once Again Going into the Manhattan Borough championships on October 28, the goal for the Stuyvesant Greyducks, the girls cross country team, was the same as it was the first day of practice: make it back to the state championships. <p>As junior Clara Mohri and freshman Julianne Yotov approached the end of the varsity 5-kilometer race, they were side-by-side battling for first. Well ahead of the others, they both had the finish line in their sights. They mustered the energy they had left, and as they crossed the finish line, they both believed they had won. The runners had the same time (21:26:55), but Mohri was crowned the champion by less than a hundredth of a second in an amazing finish.</p><p>Going into the Manhattan Borough Championships on October 28, the goal for the Stuyvesant Greyducks, the girls’ cross country team, was the same as it was for the first day of practice: make it back to the state championships. The Greyducks were in great form coming into the race, with fresh, good performances in the Grand Prix and Manhattan Invitational. After the invitational, coach Rachel Beck said, “Our Greyducks went out in full force last week at the last Grand Prix race, as well as the Manhattan Invitational. We had a lot of personal records and we are gearing up for the final push into the championship season. Stay tuned. These girls are on fire!”</p><p>As the last runner crossed the finish line, the results brought them one step closer to their goal of reaching State’s. In both the junior varsity and varsity 5-kilometer race, the Greyducks overwhelmed their opponents, handily winning both.</p><p>In the junior varsity race, out of 42 total participants, five of the six top finishers were Greyducks, led by junior Vivian Cribb with a time of 25:4:13. She has been a consistent force for the Greyducks, placing third at the NYC Mayor’s Cup on October 1. She was followed by sophomore Jing Su (25:32:28), senior and co-captain Connie Lei (25:48:80), sophomore Ling Chen (25:52:04), and junior Bernice Chen (26:0:65) who finished third, fourth, fifth, and sixth respectively. “During the recent race, we made many accomplishments. Many of our newer JV girls were running their very first 5-kilometer race at Van Cortlandt Park. Some girls broke personal records, [and] others showed steady race times and race ethics,” Chen said. “I’m proud to say that Stuyvesant High School is the Manhattan Borough Champion.”</p><p>In the varsity race, the Greyducks had five runners in the top 12, with Mohri and Yotov finishing at the top of the podium in first and second. Junior Tiffany Zhong, who placed 11th (23:21:17) in the varsity race, said, “We prepared for the race by practicing everyday and giving it our all during hard workouts. I’m extremely proud of the team for placing first in both varsity and junior varsity in the Manhattan Boroughs. Our top five JV girls all placed sixth and below, and our top five varsity girls placed 12th and below.”</p><p>Despite their win in the Borough’s, the team still needs to work hard to qualify for the State Championships, which will be based on the City Championships on November 11. “Our team is still working hard toward improving our times. Last year, we qualified for states for the first time in 13 years, and we hope to maintain our streak,” Zhong said. After enjoying tremendous success in the Borough Championships, the Greyducks hope to overcome the next hurdle on their quest for State’s: the City Championships.</p>	Article	203	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
812	﻿The Peglegs Push Through to Playoffs Despite one of their strongest seasons in years, the Peglegs lost their first playoff game, effectively ending their season. <p>The Peglegs, Stuyvesant’s boys’ varsity soccer team, finished off its strong season with an unfortunate loss in the playoffs. Second in the Manhattan A1 division, the Peglegs finished with an 8-2 record during the regular season and 24 team points out of 30, a high standing for any team. With their strong record, the Peglegs hoped to continue their momentum during the playoffs, but ultimately lost 0-1 to Newcomers High School in the first round on Sunday, October 29.</p><p>Though the Peglegs were second in their division, behind their primary rival Martin Luther King Jr. High School (MLK), this season’s record is their best divisional standing in three years. Their successes, however, have not come without sacrifices. During their last regular season game on October 24 against Frederick Douglass Academy, the team lost senior and first-string (starter) goalie David Power to an injury. Power took an ugly kick to the face and had to make an early departure, accompanied by the team’s coach, Vincent Miller.</p><p>Luckily, both of the boys’ and girls’ soccer teams were playing their last regular season games on adjacent fields. As Power and Miller left in an ambulance, the girls’ varsity soccer team coach, Hugh Francis, took over as the team’s legal coach. Junior Feras Roumie filled in on goal. “[Feras has played in] a couple of games, so I feel confident [about his playing], and I think that he’s ready to step up. He’s going to be our starting goalie next year,” said Miller, prior to their playoff game. Despite the harrowing injury to Power, the team did not give up.</p><p>“I think we did well on converting our chances. We scored three goals again against this team that had pretty good defense,” said senior and co-captain Michael Gillow, when asked about what the team did well during their final game. “I think that we were able to shut down their long ball[s], which should help us a lot in the playoffs,” he continued. However, the game was not an easy win. With five remaining minutes and a tie at 2-2, junior Robert Nava was able to score a goal off of a free kick just outside the box, breaking the tie and securing a win for the team.</p><p>With the team’s final regular season game exhibiting the individual talents as well as the teamwork of the players, the Peglegs entered the first round of playoffs as a force to be reckoned with. They played their game against Newcomers’s Lions, with a total of 21 team points.</p><p>During the playoff game on October 29, the team faced bad weather and a new goalie on the opposing side. Roumie stepped up throughout the game, making a total of six saves, more than the Lions’s goalie. The match was very close between the two teams, but ultimately the Lions were able to score a goal off of a free kick, with the shot sliding just below the crossbar. During the game, the ball was slippery and hard to control, leaving Stuyvesant with a difficult loss.</p><p>Despite this being the final season for the senior Peglegs, they have high hopes for the future of the team. While the playoff game left the Peglegs without any goals, they did take several shots throughout the game, four by Nava and one by sophomore Jeremy Moller, illustrating the power of the underclassmen and juniors, something that did not go unnoticed by the captains.</p><p>“I think we have a really bright future ahead with a strong core, including Robert, who was a highlight this season with his goal-scoring, sophomores like [Moller] and Lewis [Woloch], and also freshman, especially Amane [Anderson],” said senior and co-captain Caleb Smith-Salzberg, showing his confidence for the years and seasons to come.</p><p>Commenting on the season, Miller gave also shoutouts to various players. “[Junior] Jeffrey Shen (left mid) has been playing exceptionally well for us these last couple games. [Senior] Sunny Levitis (right mid) also has been off to a little bit of a slow start early in the season and is now playing very well. One of our better players, Robert Nava [(forward)], who has been great all year long, [...] has done very well for us. He’s set up a lot of opportunities. All three of them play very well, especially together,” Miller said. With their season drawing to a close, the seniors are confident that they will leave the team in good hands, as the juniors and many underclassmen have shown themselves to be reliable and vital to the team this year.</p><p>Though the Peglegs were unable to make it as far into the playoffs as they had hoped and they will miss their graduating seniors, their future is loaded with young talent and a strong core.</p>	Article	204	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
813	﻿Game, Set, and Match for the Lady Lobsters Despite a disappointing end to the season, the Lady Lobsters look forward to next season with optimism. <p>The Lady Lobsters, Stuyvesant’s girls’ varsity tennis team, were served a disappointing playoff exit by the second seeded team, Beacon High School on Friday, October 20. The Lady Lobsters had beat Hunter College High School 3-2 in an earlier playoff match to get them into a second round match against Beacon. It was the second year in a row that the team had lost in the quarterfinals of the playoffs.</p><p>The Lady Lobsters entered the playoffs with a regular season record of 6-4, placing them third in their Manhattan A1 division. However, the Lobsters had lost their two matches against the first place team in their division, Beacon, in the regular season 0-5 both times. However, the scores of the individual matches between players grew closer between matches.</p><p>At the teams’ first meeting, an away game for the Lady Lobsters, all of the Stuyvesant singles players lost to their opponents 2-8. But the Lady Lobsters learned from their mistakes and worked to increase their number of game points. At their second and third meetings, junior and first singles Celina Liu lost to Beacon’s junior and first singles Kyra Bergmann 5-8, a significant improvement from the duo’s initial meeting. Similarly, Stuyvesant’s first doubles duo, senior and co-captain Karina Irwin and freshman Talia Kahan, went from losing 2-8 in their first match against Beacon’s first doubles, to losing 3-8 in the playoffs against the same team. The Lady Lobsters may have a 0-3 record against Beacon at the end of the season, but at the very least, they were able to make the Beacon girls work for their wins.</p><p>Despite the early end to their playoff prospects, the Lady Lobsters have reasons to feel good about their season, as they never lost two games in a row and improved from last year’s 5-7 record. “We weren’t that disappointed because despite us losing, we still played really well. I think that matters more than how far we actually advanced. Also, the team we lost to was incredibly good,” said senior, co-captain, and second singles Marie Ivantechenko, who went 4-2 in her singles matches in the regular season. In the playoffs, Beacon was the second seed, while Stuyvesant was the seventh seed. Beacon later finished as the runner-up of the entire tournament, losing to Brooklyn Technical High School.</p><p>Out of the team’s 19 members, six of them are seniors, so the loss of these seniors will be a significant blow to the team’s dynamic lineup. “There are so many seniors this year and it’s just sad to have a final game and know that these five or six people will never play with you again,” sophomore Alyssa Pustilnik said. Pustilnik was a large part of the team’s success and will attempt to fill this void, as she looks to build on this season in which she had a singles record of 7-2.</p><p>The team will also look to junior Lily Yan, who earned high praise for her strong performance this past season. “[One of] our second doubles [players], Lily, really stepped up. She’s been on the team since her freshman year, but was a sub until this year. She really improved over the summer, and is actually going to be one of the co-captains for the next season,” Ivantechenko said.</p><p>Though the season ended sooner than they would have liked, the Lady Lobsters still have a positive attitude about the season as a whole. “We’re losing a lot of players this year, but the captains are great, and we have a lot of strong players to build a new lineup next year,” Ionkina said. Some of the freshmen have already begun to help the team significantly, such as Kahan and second doubles Palak Srivastava, who had overall records of 6-3 and 6-4, respectively.</p><p>In order for the Lady Lobsters to continue their success and increase their chances of beating intense schools like Beacon, the young talent on the team will have to step up to fill the gaps in the lineup left by the seniors.</p>	Article	205	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
814	﻿Peglegs Finish with Pride  <p>The Stuyvesant Peglegs ended their season with a warm farewell to their seniors. Friday’s Homecoming game at Pier 40 saw a large crowd full of supporters showing their gratitude for the hard work the team had put in all season. With awards being given out and banners commemorating the seniors, the stage was set for a final season hoorah.</p><p>However, the game did not go as planned. While the Peglegs ended up losing in a blowout, senior kick returner Rafsan Hamid gave the crowd something to cheer for. Having already taken a commanding lead late in the first half of Stuyvesant’s own homecoming football game, Frederick Douglass Academy was kicking off yet again. It was a short boot this time, without much air under it. The ball struck the ground well short of Hamid and seemed to meander towards him, seemingly bouncing without any rhyme or reason. Hamid approached it gingerly, anticipating the ball’s next maneuver. As he went to pick it up, it grazed off of his fingertip and came to a stop at his feet.</p><p>It seemed like déjà vu: Stuyvesant had already lost one possession to a muffed kickoff in the first quarter, so another fumble would have been the nail in the coffin with the game rapidly spiraling out of control. However, as quickly as he had dropped the bouncing ball, Hamid recovered it, promptly turning upfield and heading down the right sideline. In a slick sequence of jukes, Hamid snuck past the cover men, with the last tumbling to the floor like a horse on rollerblades. At that point, he was running free. With nothing but daylight in front of him, Hamid burst into the endzone. On one play, a swift sequence of no more than 10 seconds, Hamid had changed the course of Stuyvesant’s homecoming game and had given the Peglegs life—or so it seemed.</p><p>The return was called back due to a penalty. In an instant, all the hope and thrill that Hamid’s moment of greatness had brought was gone and erased. The Peglegs never recovered after that. As it turned out, that touchdown would have been Stuyvesant’s only score of the night, as the match ended 42-0 in favor of Frederick Douglass Academy, which was a disappointing culmination to a disappointing 0-9 season.</p><p>Despite what the scoreboard and standings table indicate, however, the Peglegs still have plenty of reason for optimism. While the Peglegs were outmatched by fierce competition throughout the season, they learned the lesson of getting up after being knocked down and never giving up through it. Ultimately, that is an indicator of success. “I believe each of these athletes will benefit from the experiences and memories from this season, no matter how much [a] 0-for season might hurt now,” head coach Mark Strasser said.</p><p>The night was a fine commemoration of the cherished time the team spent playing and bonding together. Playing their last game in the chilly air and under the lights of the pier, each of the seniors celebrated the amazing journeys and team experiences. As senior and co-captain Rafsan Hamid enumerated, “We all love and support each other, and we grew into one big family. Even though we had a tough time this season, we had a lot of fun.”</p><p>Co-captain and running back Perry Wang was just as grateful for his time as a Pegleg. “Reflecting back, I can say with confidence that some of my fondest memories of high school have to be playing football under the lights on Friday,” he said. “I've grown tight with a group of brothers I know I'll stay close with 30, 40, 50 years down the line. It's been an amazing journey, and I don't regret anything.”</p><p>The team may continue to struggle into next season, as the losses of graduating players with key positions will be tough to overcome next year. The team will rely on its current juniors to step up and fill these voids. Replacing senior quarterback Rigneyla is an area of controversy. While his play was somewhat inconsistent, with a completion percentage and passer rating of just 45 and 46 percent, respectively, one must account for the variables around him. Stuyvesant’s pass protection has been porous all season, with the quarterback seeing penetration from multiple rushers, especially up the middle, on any given play. Thus, the Peglegs’ passing offense was mostly limited to quick-hitting screen passes, and, in that dreadfully limited environment, Rigneyla was still able to hold his own. Junior Aidan Griffin is expected to take over as the starting quarterback, but it remains to be seen whether he will have the ability to lead the team every Friday, as his 30% completion percentage in limited action does not inspire much confidence.</p><p>Furthermore, the Peglegs must also replace much of their offensive line, including tackle Michael Kaydin and guard Matthew Au. Kaydin is an especially notable loss, as he became a lynchpin at left tackle toward the end of the season. His long arms allowed him to beat rushers to the edge, keeping the respective blind sides of Rigneyla and Griffin relatively clean. Au is no slouch either and was a mauler in the run game, clearing the edge for Rigneyla and running backs Tahsin Ali and Perry Wang to pick up first downs on the ground.</p><p>However, as the sentiment of the team’s leaders this year shows, success to the Peglegs means far more than just dominance on the field. As coach Strasser suggested, “Teams are unfairly judged on records alone and not on actual performance, team culture, and improvement of the team from start to finish.” While the seniors may not be leaving next year’s team with a winning record, they hope to leave a positive impression on them. Wang’s advice to next year’s team members is “to cherish the time you have left. It disappears really fast and you have no idea where time went.” Through all of the team’s setbacks, including the ill-fated homecoming game, there was still a distinct pride and energy that wafted over Stuyvesant’s sideline. The way that the team erupted during Hamid’s kickoff return was electric and represented a winning culture in spite of a losing record.</p><p>While this year may not go down as the strongest for the Peglegs, there was more to this team than record implies. The Homecoming game showed the support the Stuyvesant community has for its team, and even though it got out of hand, the team battled throughout. Led with strong senior presence and overall dedication, this team played with resiliency and heart until the last snap of the season.</p>	Article	206	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
815	Finding Peace with Violence  <p>The hallways were bustling with a plethora of entertaining and unique costumes, teachers were handing out candy, and people were animatedly talking about the usual struggles of Stuyvesant—tests, quizzes, and the lack of sleep. Later that day, I was planning on going trick-or-treating or at least overdosing on Skittles or M&M’s. Tests—and the ensuing anxiety—were coming up, but today was going to be a wonderful day.</p><p>I exited onto the bridge and down to the wall across the Tribeca Bridge. The sky was brilliant, the sun left a warm embrace on the pavement, and the air was crisp, yet comfortable. One could sit there on the wall, forget about the struggles of schoolwork and homework, and just appreciate how beautiful the weather was.</p><p>My friends and I were talking about something, and everything seemed to be so normal, when a loud bang interrupted our laughter and banter.</p><p>A horrifically dented school bus was the first thing I managed to discern through the putrid smoke in the air, and then, a deafening silence filled the air. Even the incessant movement of traffic seemed to freeze for a moment as everyone took in what seemed like a terrible accident.</p><p>“What just happened?” How could this have happened in the first place? The truck was in an extremely awkward position, and never in my life had I heard such a loud accident.</p><p>“He has a gun!”</p><p>For a moment, I froze in shock. A man got out of the truck, but from my angle and across the street, I could not discern a gun. For a moment, I stood there in awe.</p><p>Then I saw the running, the screaming from across the street, and the panicked expressions on the people around me. It suddenly dawned on me that this was something much more serious.</p><p>I sprinted down Chambers Street, and behind me I heard four gunshots. I didn’t even stop for a moment at the busy intersection. What the hell was happening? Police sirens pierced the air, and they joined together in a progressively louder wail that only intensified my heartbeat.</p><p>When I got home, I turned on the news, and I felt a sense of numbness. I was in shock. The helicopter footage showed my school and a scene of carnage that could only be described as traumatizing. I saw the bike path me and my teammates occasionally ran on strewn with the wreckage of bikes; on Snapchat, I saw the body bags.</p><p>Terrorism had struck with its evil scythe right in front of my own eyes, and suddenly, a concept we learned about in history class became so real.</p><p>At first, I only felt a sense of emptiness, of shock, of denial. This couldn’t have happened. Not in my world.</p><p>That night, the nightmares came in full force. Gunshots, me dying, my friends dying; I saw it all. I woke up early that morning, in a panicked sweat.</p><p>It had scarcely been a day since the attacks, and on the way to school, I still only felt shock. The long, slow procession of students marched around the crash site, under the watchful eye of thousands of policemen. The usual sounds of honking and chatter were replaced with the eerie drone of helicopters and the scary silence of West Street. This is all a bad dream. I walked the detour to school with the same friend that had run with me across Chambers Street when the attack started, and we couldn’t help feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>At school, the teachers all tried to return to business as usual, but a subdued sense of fear and sadness loomed over us all. People hugged me that day, and for the first three periods at least, I was holding up well.</p><p>The tsunami of emotions finally came crashing down when I went to guidance to talk about the incident. I didn’t even see it coming, but as soon as I sat down in front of my guidance counselor, the tears came rushing out. I had written about the events the night before, but now the gravity of the situation rained down on me with full force. All the thoughts that were suppressed by my stress response the night before came rushing out. Eight people died that day, and I was just in grief and extremely afraid. At that point, words couldn’t express the emotional roller coaster that I was on.</p><p>When I got home that day, I cried some more; I had homework that night, but I did so little of it. The usual background noises of sirens triggered me, and once again, my sleep was plagued with nightmares.</p><p>On Thursday, the Tribeca Bridge reopened, and life seemed more and more normal. With the exception of the police barricades and the flowers left for the victims of the attack, it almost seemed like the attack never happened in the first place. I no longer felt emotional pain or thought about the attack 24/7.</p><p>Now, the attack’s emotional trauma is gradually fading away from my mind, and in its place, new feelings have taken place. I hug my parents more often, I take the extra minute or two to appreciate them. I feel a newfound sense of appreciation for the world around me and the city I live in. My friends and I have grown closer, and our bonds have become stronger after this tragedy.</p><p>The terrorist attack on Halloween struck fear in my heart, but even though that fear has still not subsided, I strangely feel at peace with the demons in my heart. I still feel terrible for the eight families who won’t be able to appreciate their loved ones, but as their legacy, I love the people close to me even more.</p><p>I am forever changed by the Tribeca Attack, but I hope it’s for the better. This evil coward who tried to terrorize me has only made me feel more thankful to the greatness of humanity and the wonderful people my friends and family are. This act of terrorism hasn’t divided me—it’s stitched me back together, stronger than ever.</p>	Article	211	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171

818	Regarding My Experience on October 31st, 2017  <p>Screeches and then a loud bang. Car crash, was my first thought. I moved from my group of costumed friends to the staircase to see what the commotion was. Smoke from the crushed front of the pickup truck. Black oil spilled all over. I waited, pensively. All traffic on the West Side Highway had slowed to a crawl. A group of ten or so middle schoolers had gathered on the other side of the street. </p><p>Why was no one going to help the person inside get out? I kept thinking. I waited, expecting the person to stagger out or some altruistic individual to step up. Suddenly, the door banged open, and the man inside leaped out. I vividly remembered his golden handgun being the only thing I could focus on. He looked all around with his handguns pointed, looking for a target, wildly turning. I was frozen. Holy [expletive], I thought, he’s going to kill somebody. Someone behind me screamed, “He’s got a gun,” and I heard shrieks and footsteps taking off back into the school. I was still glued watching. He looked at the group of kids at the other side of the street, and strode towards them. I wish I could say I did something heroic, like turn his attention away from the kids, or that I threw something at him, but I just turned around towards Stuyvesant, and sprinted through the metal doors back into school. </p><p>I was herded by Mr. Tillman and the school police officers into the Student Union room. I went to the windows and watched as the police cars swarmed around the crashed truck. After several minutes of craning my neck to see, someone pointed out the two bodies on the bike pathway and the crumpled, strewn Citi Bikes. Police officers crowded over the bodies. Everyone was asking where the ambulance was. When the police officers brought out the white plastic covers, the questions stopped.</p><p>I live by Stuy, and the next night, as I was walking home, I decided to check out the deathbeds of those lost on that day. There was a police officer every 10 steps. There was a police officer stationed at the bloodstain of the biker. The police officer, a 35-year-old man with dark eyes, nodded at me and looked away. I sat down on the side, staring at the darker part of the concrete. The closest I had been to death before was with my great-grandparents, and that was when I was much younger. I don’t know how I feel. I’m still stuck with a lot of questions. I don’t think many of them will be answered anytime soon.</p>	Article	214	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
819	Speed of Life  <p>9/11. I always knew that it was an extremely sensitive topic to discuss. Every year at school, all my teachers would talk about how terrible and traumatizing that day was, how firefighters from the five boroughs were brave enough to go to the World Trade Center, and all of those kinds of comments. I practically have it memorized like a tape recorder. I get it. 9/11 destroyed our nation’s sense of immortality. I almost felt guilty that I didn’t feel as bad as all those people who lived through it. I was merely an infant—I didn’t really live through 9/11. It just felt like the world had always had increased, dramatic security and Islamophobia—all caused by a day in infamy that happened years ago. Isn’t it a little too much? 9/11 wasn’t really a day of infamy for me. But the Halloween of 2017? That was real. That was my day of infamy.</p><p>I was so excited to see my friends that day. I was 16 years old, full of life, only expecting to see the best of New York City. I was ready to make fun of my friends’ “hard-worked” costumes. That afternoon, I walked across Tribeca Bridge, which was normal as ever. I didn’t see any unusual activity. But as I descended the steps of Tribeca Bridge, a row of curious young faces started approaching my direction. All eyes were on me... or so I thought. As curiosity turned to concern, I finally looked at what was behind me—what everyone was actually looking at: a car accident. I couldn’t really pinpoint what my eyes were seeing. The white pickup truck looked like a black hole. A huge cloud of smoke rose from the vehicle. I tried analyzing what had actually happened. Instead, a few burning ash particles went inside my eye. Everyone was still looking at the incident.</p><p>I started moving away from the scene, thinking it was insignificant. I was mid-conversation with my friend when I suddenly heard somebody shout, “He’s got a gun!!” My ears couldn’t believe what they were hearing. He’s got a what? All the memories of 9/11, of Sandy Hook, and of Paris started racing through my mind like crazy. Instinct took over me. I started running further away from the scene, with a few other confused teenagers. However, my friend thought otherwise. “Maybe it’s just a couple of freshmen who wanted to pull a prank,” he said. Maybe. But that wasn’t a good reason to risk death. I always wondered what I’d do if I was the main character in a suspenseful movie, and I’d have to run for my life. Well now, this was it. I continued running. My friend ran along with me.</p><p>Breathe in, and out, in, and out. I ran past West Broadway and Church Street, intersections at Chambers Street. Four gunshots. Those were bullets, my friend shouted. We started running even faster, jaywalking and petrified with fear. The situation became even more dire. I passed Church Street onto Broadway. I heard some more shouts—was it safe? Please, please don’t tell me I didn’t run fast enough. Turns out, my calculator, its batteries, and a few books had fallen out of my backpack. A young man said, “Ma’am! Your book-bag is opened!” The man picked up all of my fallen belongings and kindly handed them to me. “Take it easy, Ma’am,” he said. I couldn’t run anymore with my hands full of batteries and books, so I walked more slowly. My friend waited for me near City Hall. I asked him to hold my stuff while I called my dad. I panicked as I spoke to him and couldn’t formulate words correctly.</p><p>At the City Hall station, I relaxed a little bit more and took out my Metrocard, but I clearly wasn’t relaxed because I had trouble swiping it correctly. My hands were trembling. I didn’t really talk with my friend. The sound of the bullets and shouts were still fresh in my memory.                    </p><p>I got off at 14 Street-Union Square to take the L train. Everyone around me just acted so normal, like everything was okay. Everything was not okay. How could they all just stand there typing on their phones? Suddenly I heard some more sirens from aboveground. People just obliviously glanced up and then looked back down at their phones. No one on this platform had the knowledge that I had. My eyes started swelling with tears, which then started streaming from my eyes. I was scared to death, and nobody knew about it.</p><p>I greeted my family with hugs and sobs. I told them about what happened to me, and they asked me how I felt. How I felt? I didn’t really feel a feeling. I felt like I was in some parallel universe, or a movie scene—the director was going to say, “Cut!” at any moment. But the director never appeared. This scene was too surreal.</p><p>The city isn’t as great as it seems, my parents said to me. But they were wrong. I love New York City. I love New York City more than I love anything else in my life: my school, my friends, and even my own family. But I have seen the best and worst of my favorite city. I once said to a friend, I’ve never had a bad experience. Yet, on that day, I experienced terrorism. And because of that, I will never be the same person. And? Well, that transformed me. I never thought New York City would experience terrorism again, especially after 9/11. I always thought I would be safe in NYC’s bubble and that life was like a box of chocolates—sweet and fulfilling. That day, however, surprised me. I’m sure it surprised the younger children it affected even more. Nobody should ever feel like a situation means life or death. Nobody should feel like their city can’t protect them in times of crisis. I’m even more passionate about stopping terrorism and crime, because if I have learned one thing from this experience—it’s that bad things do happen, but nonetheless, our city will remain strong.</p>	Article	215	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171	2017-11-27 05:10:38.723171
890	﻿The Fastest Food Chains Are Turning Green Fast food companies are trying to be more green, but they need to try harder to offset the mass environmental damage they have caused. <p>In recent years, fast food companies have been trying to change the stigma surrounding their industry. Long known for their unhealthy foods, large trash contributions, huge methane production, and continuous use of resources to raise animals, brands like McDonald’s and Chipotle are making a PR push to give their brands a greener reputation.</p><p>To be more eco-friendly, Starbucks, a chain brand that has set the modern standard for coffee, is using its new $1.00 reusable cups to help reduce paper waste. The incentive is that consumers get 10 cents off of refills if they use the cups, which last about a month. Chipotle sources many of its ingredients locally and buys nearly half of its beans from local farms, which is not only healthier, but also cheaper. Overseas, Sweden’s popular Max Burgers chain includes on its packaging CO2 labels that tell customers how much carbon dioxide was produced to make a certain meal. This urges customers to order more environmentally-friendly foods, including non-beef burgers.</p><p>With these programs, Starbucks has been able to significantly reduce trash hauling costs, Chipotle’s revenues have tripled, allowing the brand to expand exponentially, and Max Burgers’ CO2 labels and largely non-beef menu have added a 16 percent sales increase. For extra profitability, environmentally-friendly products like edible packaging or recyclable paper products increase customer loyalty and provide a good corporate image. Restaurants are also earning money by selling materials to recycling facilities.</p><p>However, despite their attempts to implement or encourage greener practices, the fast food industry's actions have done little to counteract the environmental harm that they continue to cause. These chains are still some of the biggest contributors to climate change and also seem to have an inability to keep up with the growing number of food-conscious consumers. The fast food industry buys billions of pounds of meat from the meat industry, which, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization, is responsible for about 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. These companies’ extensive use of eco-friendly products only helps to sanitize the fact that any increased revenue goes to increasing food production, therefore causing even more pollution.</p><p>The fast food industry can use all the eco-friendly packaging it wants, but its refusal to find healthier and greener alternatives when sourcing its meat far outweighs any attempt to reduce its ecological footprint. In 2014, McDonald’s confirmed that meat from over 100 cows can go into a single burger. Along with the many other fast food chains that share this practice, hundreds of thousands of cows per year are being used in the name of fast food.</p><p>With every cow producing about 242.5 pounds of methane a year, each cow releases 485 pounds of methane in its lifetime. After slaughter, the energy needed to process the meat and get it shipped off, cooked, and consumed adds up to over 71 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year created by the fast food industry alone.</p><p>One reason unhealthy practices are still used may be that they are cheaper than using less harmful products, allowing prices to remain as low as they are. The industry fails to see the positive long-term effects of changing to healthier food alternatives. A lot of money will go into trying to revamp an enterprise that has long been based on unhealthy fast food, but over time, greater public image can come from using better food and can provide exponential growth for companies.</p><p>The biggest factor that may be making companies hesitant to change deeper structural issues, as opposed to providing largely surface-level fixes for public appeal, is the quickly rising cost of fast food. Eating in is becoming more common and the higher prices are also working to offset increased employee wages, contributing to fast food prices that have increased 110 percent in the last 10 years. Competitors are working harder to produce faster and more easily-made food, an extension of the traditional practices of the fast food industry. This leads to additional environmental damage and adds to the destruction that companies have already put in place from years of trying to the make the quickest “ready-to-go” foods by using the cheapest and, coincidentally, unhealthiest ingredients.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s little to convince these companies to stop advancing as quickly as they are. At the rate that the fast food industry requires meat, farmers, most of whom are severely underpaid, have little ability to keep up while also providing non-harmful ingredients for consumers. Not only is it expensive for the meat industry to use less preservatives or more animal-friendly practices, but participants don’t receive much in return for any efforts to be environmentally friendly.</p><p>Much damage has been done, but it doesn’t mean that fast food companies shouldn’t make an effort to change. Instead of buying meat from an industry that is already a target of animal rights activists for its sometimes cruel slaughtering processes, the food industry can turn to providers that use more sustainable techniques. It may be more expensive, but it provides incentive for farmers to try healthier techniques when raising their animals or harvesting their crops. Increased PR and customer loyalty may also be able to persuade companies that sourcing from farms with safer practices is worth the money.</p><p>But doing it for the money shouldn’t be the only reason why the fast food industry is pursuing the green movement. The most direct solutions may come from stricter government regulations. At the moment, those imposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service aren’t trying to ensure environmentally friendlier practices. In the meat and food processing industry, most of the focus is on hygiene and preventing the mislabeling of food. The regulations on the fast food industry work to reduce America’s high obesity rates by simply asking restaurants to put nutrition facts on their products. Though these are important to address, organizations like the FDA and World Health Organization need to take into account the problems of pollution and global warming, which are most contributed to by the fast food and meat industries. Using a cleaner production system should be a part of the process for the food business to provide healthier products for consumers.</p><p>If they’re hesitant, fast food giants should look to Max Burgers, which has seen great success since it started making products that are healthier and less damaging to the environment. Though there are many cons to changing their ways, companies should ignore extra costs and look to the benefits that come with making the big leap to a healthier food industry.</p>	Article	288	2017-12-21 17:46:26.40803	2017-12-21 17:46:26.40803
893	﻿Uzbekistan: A Model For Progress Uzbekistan is a rare bright spot in a world that seems to be lurching towards right-wing authoritarianism. <p>The headlines today are not an encouraging sight. Germany, Europe’s most populous country, has failed to form a functional government and Angela Merkel’s 12-year stand as the leader of Western ideals is being threatened. Donald Trump continues to promote his populist positions and Brexit slowly chugs along. Rodrigo Duterte continues a campaign of extrajudicial crime-fighting criminals in the Philippines. It seems the tide of right-wing populism will not cease soon.</p><p>But an unlikely region of the world, Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, is undergoing a stage of liberalization, a remarkable development given its geography and the global trend toward autocracy. By making both political and economic reforms, Uzbekistan is showing that liberalism still has a place in the world, even in countries that used to be brutally repressive.</p><p>From the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 to last year, Uzbeks had known only one leader, President Islam Karimov. A ruthless autocrat, Karimov quashed the independent media with an iron fist. Journalists who did not support the government were thrown in jail for extraordinary amounts of time. One of these journalists, Muhammad Bekjanov, served 18 years in prison for contributing to the newspaper of the main opposition party in Uzbekistan. Bekjanov endured grotesque torture and served time in prisons with names such as “Goodbye to Youth.” Karimov even imprisoned members of his own family on suspicion that they were plotting against him.</p><p>However, last year, Karimov died suddenly and his Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev replaced him. Given his long tenure in the Karimov government, one would expect Mirziyoyev to continue his predecessor's ways.</p><p>Instead, he has started to reform Uzbekistan economically and politically. He allowed banks and companies to exchange foreign currencies at the market rate instead of at artificial, government-set rates. Mirziyoyev also toured the neighboring countries of Russia and China to promote Uzbekistan’s new openness to foreign investment. With a population of 30 million, Uzbekistan is the most populous country in Central Asia and investors regard it as a significant opportunity as the country is relatively undeveloped.</p><p>Even more remarkably, the country is liberalizing politically. Sixteen political prisoners have been released since Mirziyoyev took office and talk shows have more free expression. Uzbekistan’s notorious forced labor system, where college students and youth were forced to pick cotton, has been curtailed and the country has risen in the World Corruption Index.</p><p>Some say these actions are just a feint to open up Western sanctions on Uzbek cotton, which is not impossible. But even if minimal progress is made for the sake of growing the Uzbek economy, the world will be a better place. Central Asia has long been a black hole where democracy goes to die, but Uzbekistan is providing a welcome change from this narrative.</p><p>Mirziyoyev is not a saint, either. Some journalists have been arrested since he took power and the feared head of the Uzbek version of the KGB remains in power. However, progress cannot be made overnight.</p><p>Formerly, the U.S. State Department would promote such reforms around the world through peaceful means. However, under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the State Department has been undergoing an eight percent reduction in staff and faces a 31 percent budget cut from the Trump administration. This has been an obscene abdication of American leadership when the world perhaps needs it most. In an era when President Trump is championing “America First” along with rejecting leadership on the global stage, it is heartening to see American ideals taking root in formerly authoritarian countries.</p>	Article	291	2017-12-21 17:48:54.574557	2017-12-21 17:48:54.574557
897	﻿What’s In a “reputation”? A review of “reputation” and an exploration of what it means for Taylor Swift as an artist. <p>For months, the world saw little of Taylor Swift. Turns out, it’s because the “‘old Taylor is dead,” as Swift herself declares in “Look What You Made Me Do,” the lead single of her newest album. Taylor Swift’s sixth album, “reputation,” was released November 10, 2017 amid great anticipation and controversy, and Swift has taken care to present it as a clean break between her old persona and her new image.</p><p>From the start, Swift tries to distinguish herself and her album’s new style as unlike anything she’s ever done before. “… Ready For It,” the album’s first song, is dark and fast-paced; Swift’s tone is aggressive and much more reminiscent of rap than her former country-style crooning. The static and deep bass create a white noise effect underlying Swift’s singing that reflects a heavier sound than she’s put out before. It serves as a warning shot that this new Taylor Swift is nothing like the gentle America’s sweetheart that fans have grown used to.</p><p>And yet, as the song reaches the chorus, Swift’s voice reverts back into the familiar high-pitched, soft quality that marked her previous work. In fact, it’s almost impossible to not be reminded of “Wildest Dreams,” Swift’s single from her 2014 album, “1989.” Within the first minute, “reputation” established the inescapable question posed by the album and by Taylor Swift as an evolving artist: is the old Taylor really dead?</p><p>Perhaps dead is an over-exaggeration. Swift’s collaboration with rapper Future and singer Ed Sheeran in “End Game” of the same album makes for a unique song and an interesting blend of musical styles, but Swift’s key characteristics prevail. In her verse, Swift sings, “And I can’t let you go, your hand prints on my soul / It’s like your eyes are liquor, it’s like your body is gold,” continuing to display lyrical talent and a specific eloquence and romanticism when describing a lover that she has long been associated with.</p><p>At the same time, the song seesaws between brimming with confidence, as Swift loudly mocks her “big reputation,” and what appears to be vulnerability, as Swift expresses, “I don’t wanna be / Just another ex-love / You don’t wanna see.” Ultimately, her direct declaration of her expectations in the relationship—to be the “end game”—unveils a new depth and a change in Taylor, who seems to be taking increased control in her own fate, breaking from the helplessness of her former self.</p><p>This shift in Swift’s approach to relationships is consistent throughout the album. For the first time, Swift is secure rather than miserable. “Call It What You Want To” embodies this message: Taylor can be content and happy in her relationships without having to define them to anyone. In singing, “My baby’s … high above the whole scene / Loves me like I’m brand new,” Swift truly establishes a new Taylor, one that won’t be subject to manipulation, and a new sort of love, one that is steadfast and real.</p><p>It is refreshing to see Swift finally embrace her sexuality. “Dress” is breathy and unmistakably suggestive. Swift is blunt like never before as she croons, “Only bought this dress so you could take it off.” Perhaps it does harken back to the old Taylor in its sense of want and (as Swift herself says) “pining and desperately waiting,” but it does so in a way that is new and different because Swift is making the choice to be vulnerable. Whereas before Swift might have been defenseless when it came to love, she now intentionally lets her guard down.</p><p>Furthermore, it is shocking to see Swift directly referencing sex or, as she does later in the song, drinking. These more mature elements shield “reputation” from the naivety that blanketed the old Taylor; she has, invariably, grown up. Carnal themes have always been excluded from Taylor Swift’s image, which centered around her innocence. By finally incorporating them, Swift acknowledges that her image has inevitably changed as she herself has evolved into a grown woman.</p><p>Swift is defiantly unapologetic, evident in “I Did Something Bad” where Swift loudly declares, “They said I did something bad, / Then why’s it feel so good? … And I’d do it over and over and over again if I could.” Behind her singing, the drums are explosive, a feeling which pervades throughout the song and evokes the sense of a person being pushed past the edge. Swift finally indicates her own guilt, a stark contrast to her previous role as a victim. Her lack of remorse is a strong rejection of her role as “the good guy.” By combining her fiery lyrics with the song’s forte, Swift effectively creates the feeling of intense liberation.</p><p>Swift also poses a direct challenge to her accusers as she sings, “They’re burning all of the witches even if you aren’t one / So light me up… go ahead and light me up.” In doing so, Swift becomes a much more empowered and fearless figure; she fully embraces her bad press, freed from having to preserve her reputation.</p><p>Musically, “reputation” is dramatically distinct from Swift’s previous work. “Don’t Blame Me” is a dark, soulful sermon enveloped in Gothic undertones. The percussion sounds like a heartbeat, while Swift’s deeper, drawled voice that sounds less like singing than it does talking sounds like a confession. The slow, powerful tempo matched with declarations such as, “And baby for you / I would fall from grace / Just to touch your face,” reveal a side of Swift that is raw and heartfelt.</p><p>Meanwhile, Swift’s voice seems to be endlessly flexible. In “Delicate,” her hushed tones and sweet singing are magnetic and sensuous. The electronic influences are expertly employed, with Swift’s voice taking on a robotic sound distinguished by its wavering quality. The inhuman, electric sound provides a beautiful juxtaposition with the delicate tone of Swift’s natural singing, resulting in a surprising contrast. It’s a bold presentation of Swift’s musical genius.</p><p>Curiously, the album’s closing song, “New Year’s Day,” is written and sung in a very classic Taylor Swift style. It is gentle, slow, and one of the few occasions where Swift retains an aura of innocence. The minimalist piano tones in the background allow Swift’s ultimately optimistic message to pervade; despite all of the turbulence of her previous romantic endeavors, she intends to stay with the person who’s willing to do the same. Thus, Swift ends her revolutionary album with an old-fashioned acknowledgement of her growth beyond the romantic notions of midnights and preference for the steadiness of someone who helps clean up the mess in the morning.</p><p>Certainly, “reputation” is a heavy album. Its sound is a melting pot of classic Taylor styles and new, darker, uncharted musical territories. Despite Swift’s insinuations that her image is always what she has carefully crafted, she is nevertheless sincere and open within her music as she always has been. I cannot say that I believe there is a new and old Taylor. More likely, there is just Taylor Swift, an artist and media sensation and human who grows and evolves while her music follows suit.</p>	Article	295	2017-12-21 18:05:08.281027	2017-12-21 18:05:08.281027
901	﻿Academic Dishonesty: An Inherent Issue?  <p>Academic dishonesty is a term often thrown around at Stuyvesant, and yet the definition is sometimes unclear. Stuyvesant has garnered an unfortunate reputation for it in recent years, largely based on the well-publicized 2012 Regents cheating scandal. Yet, many find the cheating environment at Stuyvesant to be normal or even expected of such an academically rigorous environment. Students, teachers, and administrators have vastly different opinions on what academic dishonesty entails, and when, if ever, it is even acceptable. An Academic Dishonesty Policy is distributed to students in the beginning of each school year, yet many students have no idea what the policy is.</p><p>The Spectator conducted an online survey, as well as interviews with various members of the Stuyvesant community, to explore the idea of academic dishonesty, and why and how it occurs at our school. 329 students responded to the survey. Here are the results:</p><p><b>Have you ever committed academic dishonesty?</b></p><p>Yes: 83.3%<br>No: 9.7%<br>I’m not sure: 7%</p><p>While at least half of the students in every grade bracket say they have committed academic dishonesty, it is most prevalent in those with a GPA ranging from 85-89, followed by a GPA ranging from 80-84. Academic dishonesty is least common among those with a GPA of 98 or higher.</p><p>Academic dishonesty is nearly equally prevalent between genders: 86 percent of male respondents and 80 percent of female respondents have cheated in some way.</p><p>It is most common in the junior class, where 97 percent of respondents have cheated. Junior year is often considered the most stressful and important year in terms of grades by students, which may explain the high number. Meanwhile, 56 percent of freshman respondents have committed academic dishonesty in their first four months at Stuyvesant.</p><p><b>On a scale of 1 to 5, how frequently do you think you cheat in comparison to the rest of the student body? (1=I never cheat, 5=I cheat much more often than most people I know)</b></p><p>1: 13.4%<br>2: 42.2%<br>3: 29.2%<br>4: 10.6%<br>5: 4.6%</p><p><b>Can you define academic dishonesty?</b></p><p>“Completing any assignment with work other than that completed completely by you. Academic dishonesty ranges from not paying attention in lab and scribbling down your partner’s answers to pulling out your phone during a test.”</p><p>“Academic dishonesty in my view is a more self-centered view than that described by the school. In my mind, letting someone copy off my answers on a test is fine. I would slide my paper into their view and that would be that. For me, it is not considered cheating. I am not gaining anything out of sharing answers. I do not gain unfair advantages by letting someone copy off my answers, thus I do not feel guilty at all. The converse of that situation, however, is cheating. If I do not know the answer and someone shares it to me, I consider that cheating as you are using information you would not have known. You are only academically dishonest if you are lying to yourself.”</p><p>“Any action meant to give a student or group of students an unfair advantage in any school assignment.”</p><p>“Using or sharing outside information (whether it be another student, the Internet, or even yourself) without citing and/or saying it's your own work.”</p><p><b>Have you ever cheated on a test?

Teacher caught them, told me to cover my paper, and didn't do anything else.”</p><p>“Caught copying a homework; counted as a 0, phone call home.”</p><p>“0 on the assignment, academic dishonesty hearing.”</p><p><b>Has your opinion towards cheating changed since you got to Stuyvesant? </b></p><p>Yes, I have a more positive view towards cheating: 36.8% <br>Yes, I have a more negative view towards cheating: 15.2% <br>No: 48%</p><p><b>Would you say there is a cheating problem at Stuyvesant? </b></p><p>Yes: 57.4%<br>No: 42.6%</p><p><b>Do you think cheating is justifiable, ever? </b></p><p>Yes: 71.4%<br>No: 28.6%</p><p><b>Why or why not? </b></p><p>“Some teachers are very unreasonable when it comes to homework and tests, so it is expected that students won't try if they aren't taught material. Sometimes, we are burdened with a lot of work and can't study for a test or do homework. It shouldn't be a regular thing, but it's okay. Teachers can't expect us to be reasonable when they are unreasonable.”</p><p>“At Stuy, there’s so much pressure to perform, and there comes a point where you just can’t get a 95 on your fifth test that week. That’s what drives me to cheat. Same with homework. When you’re five hours into homework and haven’t even started the essay due tomorrow, you think, I guess I can ask my friend for the math answers.”</p><p>“Stuyvesant puts you in a situation where doing extraordinarily well isn't possible without sacrificing something.”</p><p>“We all are just helping each other out. Stuyvesant breeds a culture of cheating, and you’re honestly stupid to not take advantage of it.”</p><p>“The only reason we justify and do cheat is because the system we're in pressures us to care about grades and numbers, and not about our actual level of academic achievement.”</p><p>“Although I disagree with cheating on tests, I view cheating on homework assignments as justifiable. Many homework assignments are tedious and meaningless. Although some classes legitimately benefit from homework, some teachers assign homework for the sake of it, even if there is nothing to be gained from it. ”</p><p>“There is no reason to ever cheat. Study for your tests, do your homework. People should only get credit for work they do, so I don't think they should get a higher grade because they successfully cheated on a test compared to those who studied, but may have still got some questions wrong.”</p><p>“There is no honor in cheating. If anyone justifies Stuyvesant's atmosphere as the cause of their cheating, they don't deserve to even go here.”</p><p>“At the end of the day, cheating is still cheating, it should not be justifiable ever, period.”</p><p><b>Anything else you would like to say?</b></p><p>“There are many ambiguous territories within academic dishonesty—for instance, the first bullet point within Stuyvesant's own policy prohibits "presenting the ideas of others (either by paraphrasing or direct quotation) without credit to the source." I took APCS, and am currently taking another post-AP CS elective, and a big part of getting through assignments is simply googling how to use certain functions or understanding why you are getting an error, and using that code that you see to fix your own work. The very nature of computer science makes it impossible to do substantive work without some form of ‘academic dishonesty.’ Citing these sources would be meaningless, because none of us are ever the ‘first’ to write a particular line of code.”</p><p>"It's not academic dishonesty if you don't get caught."</p><p>“I think that students who cheat routinely will find themselves in serious trouble down the road, but students who cheat occasionally shouldn't feel terribly about it. If that's really the case, that specific grade doesn't define you, and neither does cheating.”</p>	Article	299	2017-12-21 22:09:13.152867	2017-12-21 22:09:13.152867
1000	﻿Toward a Transparent Student Union  <p>In an interview with The Spectator last spring, Student Union (SU) President Tahseen Chowdhury said, “Every SU in the past and every platform that you’ve seen in the past always have specific ideas, and we lack that, and that’s good.” But the SU’s failure to communicate specific goals, or sometimes even to communicate at all, has only caused it to seem out-of-touch—there is an SU hotline, for instance, but Stuyvesant does not allow students to make phone calls in school.</p><p>This is not to say the SU is superfluous. It has had some successes, such as providing stuy.edu e-mail addresses, attempting to enforce a homework policy, and setting up the printing station.</p><p>But for every achievement, there are multiple failed or useless projects: promising and not delivering a locker trading system for the fall of 2017; not reliably helping clubs make their own websites through StuyClubPub.org; inability to enforce allowing students in early from their lunch periods; and the disappearance of bathroom hooks, to name a few.</p><p>Some ventures, like opening up the fifth floor balcony, seem both unattainable and arbitrarily chosen. Similarly, the freshmen and sophomore caucuses devote most of their energies towards planning grade dances like Semi-Formal, despite these events not being met with similar enthusiasm from the student body.</p><p>SU members often argue that their accomplishments are backstage, such as haggling with administration over student autonomy or organizing SING! logistics. Even if the SU is incredibly productive “behind-the-scenes,” the fact that their primary functions are nearly invisible—not advertised to, or understood by, most students—indicates a lack of dialogue with their constituents.</p><p>Students receive few updates on what their student officials are doing. Though SU e-mails are constant, these are almost always weekly schedules or reminders about school events, rather than providing insight on SU projects or requests for student input.</p><p>The SU has attempted to establish communication through other means, namely Facebook posts and video updates. Besides being difficult to access for students who are not regular Facebook users (which particularly hurts freshmen who may not be accustomed to Stuyvesant’s Facebook-heavy culture), these posts also do not provide significant information about the SU’s work, but rather list upcoming events.</p><p>Another issue with the SU’s communication is its size. The SU has been aggressively expanding, and now has approximately 250 members. Many new positions have been formed, such as the Director of Music and Supplies in the Freshman Caucus, and the SU has stated that they want to increase the number of task forces to handle new problems and projects. These new titles are part of a push to make the SU more inclusive, but they have instead created bureaucratic bloat.</p><p>This attempt at inclusion through creating hundreds of positions is an ineffective solution that leaves the rest of the student body isolated. Indeed, the SU is often seen as an exclusive club, disconnected from non-SU member peers and operating within their own social circle.</p><p>Oversizing also leads to inefficiency. The current SU fails to reap the benefits of specialized lower offices. Mobility between different departments is high, leaving many officers unacquainted with their duties. The lower offices often redirect student concerns to higher offices anyway. Students needing assistance then become unsure as to whom they should approach. Redundant and vague positions such as the freshman caucus’s multiple chiefs of staff and advisors only add to the confusion.</p><p>Lower offices are also difficult to locate on the websites of the various caucuses. Many important pages, such as the “task forces” menu button on the SU website and the advisory council page of the sophomore caucus, do not open up or do not have content. Chowdhury and SU Vice President Alexa Valentino’s platform states, “Task forces are designed to be started rapidly to ensure that we take on any good ideas.” But the near invisibility of these task forces—names, officers, guidelines, or mission statements are nowhere to be found—makes it difficult to contact them with problems or to know what they have accomplished.</p><p>Another of the Student Union’s biggest tasks is managing over $100,000 and dispersing that among clubs and publications. But the page for budget information on their website directs students to a Google document from last school year, with Niels Graham, an alumnus, as the listed contact. The updated “Clubs and Pubs Rules and Regulations” sheet specifies that clubs must complete “appropriate paperwork available at the SU website,” and that the SU only appropriates funds at certain times throughout the year. Neither the dates nor the form are readily available online.</p><p>As a result of this lack of transparency, when the SU accomplishes something (or fails to), students don’t always know; when students are told the SU has accomplished something, they rarely know how or why.</p><p>The SU should redefine its role to be the intermediary between students and the administration. As the most direct link between the two, the SU should be the main advocate for student needs.</p><p>In this capacity, the SU can focus its energies on incorporating student opinions. Before pursuing large-scale undertakings, the SU should poll the student body. This could be as simple as a Google form with a paragraph proposing a change, a one-to-five rating scale, and a space for additional comments. The survey’s results should be made public so that students know what the SU will be doing, and on what basis. Similarly, occasional surveys could also be used to poll student opinion on current SU endeavors, in order to see whether continuing them is a good investment of resources.</p><p>Better advertising SU cabinet meetings, or holding town halls, would also provide non-SU members with a forum to listen to and question the leaders of the student body, as well as provide their own recommendations. The result of increased engagement with students would be more clearly defined goals, with a larger support-base, that the SU could dedicate its energies toward.</p><p>Revitalizing the “task force dedicated to speaking to you,” which was established in the 2016-17 school year, would also improve communication. This task force is supposed to consist of a group of SU members who walk around the school to discern student opinions. Having them be more active (they only interview about five students per month, according to an SU official) and public about their findings would give the student body more confidence in the SU, and allow students to gain consensus through e-mail, form, or social media from the limited number of students such a task force can reach out to.</p><p>Improved communication can be readily facilitated by consolidating the SU’s bureaucracy. Eliminating unnecessary officials, and clearly delineating which students are responsible for which jobs, would establish a much more navigable chain of command.</p><p>This streamlining would need to be supplemented with an up-to-date website, or some other place with easily available information about the SU (such as physical postings in the school). Clearly explaining who to contact in specific scenarios would go a long way toward establishing confidence and conversation with the student body, without requiring much time or energy on the part of the SU.</p><p>Having some form of government is vital to the student body: it provides an outlet for complaints, a channel to the administration, and a way to organize and actualize the student body’s desires. Many of the SU’s current projects fulfill these responsibilities; however, there are many more from which students are kept in the dark. The first step for the SU to become an effective intermediary is greater transparency.</p>	Article	398	2018-01-23 02:45:20.664759	2018-01-23 02:45:20.664759
1005	﻿Thunder, Death, and Weird Jokes “Thor: Ragnarok” is blessed with a phenomenal cast and eye-catching action scenes and cinematography, but it's quality is hindered by its inability to uphold a serious tone. <p>“Thor: Ragnarok” had a lot to prove as the finale of the Thor trilogy. The first two movies, though well-received, were unsuccessful in dazzling their viewers and are not recognized as popular fan-favorites. “Thor: Ragnarok” was Marvel’s last chance in defining Thor movies as a memorable, spectacular superhero trilogy instead of a collection of three decent movies. To do this, it had to be bold and thrilling, and its plot both complex and of a scale large enough to be fitting for a movie named after the end of the world in Norse mythology.</p><p>The film, directed by Taika Waititi, revolves around Thor (Chris Hemsworth), god of thunder, and his quest to stop his older sister and goddess of death, Hela (Cate Blanchett), from conquering his kingdom Asgard and the universe. Along the way, he is captured and held captive in Sakaar by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), who forces him to participate in his gladiatorial contest. There, Thor collaborates with his stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), his new friend Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), and his old fellow Avenger Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), or the Hulk, to escape Sakaar and defeat Hela.</p><p>The greatest aspect of “Thor: Ragnarok” is its cast. The actors manage to add depth to characters that are generally portrayed as one-dimensional.</p><p>Hemsworth chooses to emphasize Thor’s vulnerability that results from his dependence on his magic hammer, Mjolnir, to feel worthy, instead of focusing on his tough side. This emphasis lets Hemsworth portray Thor’s character growth in becoming a leader who is confident enough to step up to protect the people of Asgard more effectively.</p><p>Hiddleston manages to keep Loki’s status as the most complex and interesting villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He constantly switches Loki’s demeanor from friendly to devious and back, almost as if he is choosing to convey Loki as two different characters: a teammate and a foe. This creates confusion, among the viewers as well as the characters within the film, regarding his true nature.</p><p>The juxtaposition of the Grandmaster’s jokester personality and malice, shown through his willingness to force innocents to fight to the death for entertainment, is hard to pull off. Nevertheless, Goldblum depicts the Grandmaster as humorous, but not too campy—dangerous, but not too one-note. Thompson’s combination of Brunnhilde’s grief over the loss of her fellow Valkyrie and strength as a female lead gives her character a lot of unexpected depth.</p><p>Yet, despite its flashy action scenes, stellar cast performances, and vivid cinematography reminiscent of retro sci-fi fantasy, “Ragnarok” feels less like a superhero film and more like a comedy.</p><p>Its comedic moments never fail in getting a laugh out of the viewer and arguably makes “Thor: Ragnarok” the most fun movie of the Marvel franchise.</p><p>One such example of a comedic moment is the use of the “get help” strategy, where Thor rushes in frantically while supporting a supposedly injured Loki, yelling “Get help! Please! My brother’s dying!” before throwing Loki to bowl over a group of enemy guards. Despite the serious discussion about their relationship as brothers preceding this moment, the very fact that Thor chooses to throw his brother, and the contrast of Loki’s humiliation and Thor’s jubilation that follows, come together to form a scene that is impossible not to find at least somewhat amusing.</p><p>Waititi uses other formulas similar to this throughout the film in order to guarantee that viewers find humor in scenes he designates to be comical.</p><p>But the extremity of this comedic tone causes all attempts of seriousness to fall flat.</p><p>Korg (Taika Waititi), an ally Thor made on Sakaar, represents one aspect of the film’s biggest flaw. Korg’s only purpose in the movie is to provide comic relief. Aside from that, he has no character development and does not do much to influence the plot. The fact that a character like Korg, whose role is purely to serve as comic relief, is a main character of the film only further serves to make the jocularity of the film so great that it cancels out all the film’s solemnity.</p><p>Another aspect of this flaw is Waititi’s habit to follow any moment with potential to have a great emotional impact with humor. The viewer sees this with Bruce Banner’s decision to sacrifice his very identity in order to let the Hulk take over and help the people in ways Banner cannot in the final battle.</p><p>Ruffalo does an excellent job showing Banner’s inner conflict of his fear of the Hulk taking permanent control of his being and his feelings of duty as a former Avenger. However, Waititi chooses to turn his final decision into a punchline by having him initially fail to transform, which causes Banner to crash-land onto the bridge in front of two armies. The resulting secondhand embarrassment the viewer experiences creates hilarity, which takes away the gravity behind Banner’s preceding determination and gives it less of an emotional impact on the viewer.</p><p>Thor’s decision to initiate Ragnarok in order to summon Surtur, the only being that could defeat Hela, even though this meant the land of Asgard would be destroyed, could also have had greater weight. Thor’s claim that “Asgard is not a place, it’s a people” is meant to justify his willingness to give up the well-being of the land in favor of the well-being of that land’s people.</p><p>Yet after leaving Asgard to be destroyed by Surtur, Korg mentions that he had accidentally stepped on his best friend Miek, which would have been considered a much more serious concern had he not said it so nonchalantly. When Miek wakes up a few seconds after he says this, Korg exclaims, “Oh, wait! Miek’s alive!” with a much too delighted tone regarding the circumstances.</p><p>Waititi’s attempt to lighten the mood right after the most destructive event of the film is the most prominent example of how “Thor: Ragnarok” is unwilling to darken its tone by any amount, even if darkening the tone could have elevated its status from a simple comedy to an outstanding superhero movie.</p>	Article	403	2018-01-23 02:50:44.663701	2018-01-23 02:50:44.663701
